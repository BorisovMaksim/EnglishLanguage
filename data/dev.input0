This is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational. 
You must have a computer or device that allow you communicate with schools, if not, you won't be able, The only way that you can learn from home it's internet, but at the same time there are people that can buy those resources. 
I believe that we should keep the Electroal, because it makes citizens feel that they are in the system and without it people aren't really voting for who they want 
There is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but there should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines. 
Not everyone can agree that the face of Mars is just a landform or alien life; thus the face or landform still remained as an anonomys fact of mystery. 
I find that most effective when reading that you can try some thing when being able to understand different things. 
the difficulty of coming to agreements. 
Cell Phone use should be illegal while driving. The worst are texting and talking on the cellphone while driving. Both inhibit driver awareness and increase the risk of getting into an accident. Hands free devices do not eliminate the risk of getting into an accident; it's a horribly common misconception. Cell phone distractions on the road cause accidents. If Illinois outlawed cell phone use, more people's lives would be saved.   
To summarize,if we want a fair election and be part of it, listen to others options, have part of the the decision of our president , and be trheated the same and the our vote really counts we should elect by popular vote.            
Projects that are controlled by the student will allow icebreaker activities to run smoothly. Icebreaker activities are typically included in the first day of school, and they allow students to get to know each other and their teacher. If every student came prepared to share their presentation, they they would not only learn something about their fellow classmates, but they would also get the chance to work on their public speaking and presentation skills. Public speaking may be one of the most relevant and commonly used skills as you enter higher education and the workforce, as it is something that is hard to avoid. The more it is practiced, the more comfortable people, in this case, student will get with it. Students can also use this project as a starting to point to see where they might what to take their future. Deciding classes for the next school year, or even thinking about a college major can be difficult and intimidating. However, if students know their passions and interests, then the process will seem significantly less worrisome. A way to reduce the stress on making decision such as classes or college, is to let students discover their interests through student-designed projects. 
Ford, Volkswagen, Kia, and Chevy's... while these car brands may have been a massive part of the American culture, its significance in our lives may be declining.  According to recent studies and stories from around the world, car transportation popularity is decreasing dramatically. 
What if the Presiident ignores a certain region of the country in crisis? It is a risk we must take. 
Sometimes voters get confused and choose the wrong candidate which is one of the reasons why people think the electoral college should be terminated . 
reduces a candidates intrest in a state. 
Allow this task to be used in our school as long as all students obey the rules of cell phone use. See if all students can complete this task by not using them during class and make sure that all phones are turned off at that time. Each students can try to complete this and not mess it up for the rest of the school and students. Thank you principle for agreeing or disagreeing to this task at our school. 
i wouldnt want no new technologie about my feelings. 
If I change the policy it would be people with a c or above average can play sports but students who have a d or below can't play. The students with a d or below can not play because they do not work hard to keep there grades up. The students that have a d or below think they can play sports, but do not have to do the work 
In the United States we need to have a fair way of allowing everyone to vote therefore please help me in choosing to change the electon to popular vote 
Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work. 
Do you know whats great once in a while advice. 
they hone important skills regardless of the origin of their design, 
The school could put that time they spent into helping out the school and making the school a better place for the students so they could have a better place to learn. 
After laying out the dangers of studying Venus, the author explains why scientists continue to study the planet. "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system" (4). By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied. 
Dr. Huang's invention is very interesting 
is about in defense of the five electoral college:five reason to keep our  despised method of choosing the president. The electoral college is widely regarded a an anachronism ,a non-democratic method of selecing a president that ought to be [overruled] by decaring  the candidate who recives the most popular votes is the winner. But each party selects a slate of electorstrusted to vote for the party;s nominee(and that trustis rarely betrayed).Yet that has happend very rarely. There are 5 reason for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democrat pedigree; all are practical reasons,not liberal or conservative reasons.    
When a president wins only the electoral votes and not the popular vote, many dont feel like they are actually their president. Most people would prefer direct voting because it actaully makes everybodys votes count equally and everybody has equality. Winning electoral votes doesnt show that you won because the majority of people wanted you to win, it shows you have many supporters to give you more votes through the electoral college 
I know I enjoy getting out there, and just playing what I want to play. It motivates me to do my homework, study for tests, focus more in class. That seems to be one of the problems why you don't want students doing sports, because you want them to focus more on their work, well, I'm not sure that would be the best idea. 
In my town getting your license is a huge deal. As soon as I turned fifteen I went streight to the DMV to take my test and get to driving as soon as possible. In countries and cities such as Germany, France, and Bogota, driving is ban pretty much where ever you go. After days of near-record pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city and as a result congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Smog flooded Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world. 
So many reaserchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to help gain some imformation of Venus 
its amazing isn't it all we have to do is take a picture and voala we know what the choice is because if he is being truethfull we can say yes he fits but if he is lying we know that we have to make a better choice that just vote on him right of way . 
make them believe they wont be successful without playing the sport they love. 
Lets take a look at the present. President Obama who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes since were a large state we get more votes. take a look at map where its shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes, it shows each state. many small state have less than 5 electoral votes simply because its not huge, but yet again you're voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors 
but they also say what if they become evil and they go against us and take over the world and kill us all. i think that if they ever make robots and that were to happen then it was all planned because this bings me back to my point. robots dont have souls which means that they cant procces haterate in them. unless they were programed to feel hate but they are sensative so if they actually learn how scientist wants them to learn then i believe that they still wouldnt take over the world unless they were programed to. 
there is no eveidence that Aliens have been on the planet Mars, 
On the other hand, according to "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" (Parargraph 14) the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair 
Students should not have to do a extra activity 
Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed "Face on Mars". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous. 
Students who attend classes from home do not benefit socially 
The facts abouts about venis and how the author shows that it can be dangerous to be on venis. 
In conclusion we can prove that the Face in Mars is just a natural landform. 
In this article the evidence they use for example: "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals" and also "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus" supports the controdicting claim that going to Venus is too dangerous with too many complications. 
No one is perfect and accidents do happen but in a driverless car who is to blame? This issue could cause serious law cases and court battles over injuries or damages indured in a crash with a driverless car. 
The people should also get the vote because wouldn't it make sense if the people did get who they voted for anyways? 
The article says,"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.'' Which is great they are working on that, 
Although teachers argue that they have taught for many years and they know the weak points students have for certain topics, 
Community services is what helps keep Detroit safe in the time most 
About 26% of accidents are caused by people using their phones while being behind the wheel. 
but when they realize they are working together to help the community they should feel better about themselves 
Some may say that distance learning won't reduce the likelihood of getting others sick or becoming sick 
If you want people to have good lives then you dont need these kind of things in the world. 
A similar reason to seek advice from multiple people is bias. 
Driverless cars are the future for the world. I don't really like the concept, but it's the future and anything is possible. Driverless cars have many pros and cons. The cars can be useful, but then they could be harmful to it's surrounding safety wise. If the driverless cars will have sensors then what's the use for the person to have to be cautious at all times for? Like i've said before I take safety very serious and I hope the maunufacturers take it more serious for the future of the "autonomous car." 
Overall i think that finding new ways to explore and studie venus is a great idea i think that will change history maybe in the future venus can become our second home if we find out more about it and venus will soon be an explored planet and hope that will continue with other planets. 
I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. 
Choosing our president is more complicated than people think it is . One thing that voters do not know when electing presidents is that their vote might not matter as much as they think due to the electoral college . Who is to say electoral votes or better than popular votes ? 
Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from both sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another. 
how would they call the police if there phones are at home that student will be dyeing right before the other students eye what would you do. 
because we don't want to live in a dirty community. We also don't want viruses. If we keep this community clean then maybe a lot of people won't be sick and live longer. 
The landform is Martian mesa formation much like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. 
I think the autors statement on this is that when the temperature drops its very hard to communitcate with people going up there, but when it cools down its better for them. 
We should also keep the electrol college so congress helps our nation to vote also 
I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community. 
cell phone use can very deadly for teen drivers 
In the end we realize asking multiple people for advice even if they are young or old, is the way to go, because it will benefit you the most. Whatever the advice you need may be, asking many is the beneficial thing to do. So next time you are in need of advice remember these key things to look for and follow, then ask away. Remember the more people the more answers, the more you'll understand the advice, and the better decision you will make. This is why asking multiple people versus one is the right way to ask advice.  
As we found out that we may have found a way to a other civilazation. I just recently told you that we should never go near Mars. The reason why I told you that is because we don't now their lifes, their ways, or even if they were freindly. When NASA told us that we have a way to find people we should never talk to them. Yes it does show that we had images of planet Mars or even that their might have been a culture. 
In addition, if a student is really sick and needs to go home, they can call their mom or dad on their cell phone. 
I doubt anyone can live in a world like that. There probably wont be no sports, no shopping for good clothes and even some death , instead there will be flatten basketballs and footballs because since no one helped the earth all of our resources would be gone and your parents will lose their jobs so the president can try to make the world good again , raise taxes so less stuff for us kids. If you go to the store there wont be awesome clothes like polo instead there will be some horrible stuff like messed up clothes that hobos be wearing, and i know for a fact no kid want to be wearing them definitely if your a fashion diva. See a world like this isn't the world us kids want. 
its just like carpooling everyone can ride in one vehicle and use less gas to make the air more dense and clear so the less gas you can use the better the air will be more clear so everyone can breathe in clean air for their lungs but if you don't like to use public transportation use you can always walk, jog, or even run because it's a great way to excersize your muscles.    
If your parents are divorced then then you might not be able to see your mom and your dad as much. Without being able to see your parents as much that will leave you and your parents depressed do to the mental health problems that occurs when your parents divorce. 
from where is see it if it helps us why  not keep it even if it doesnt always pan out as planed we all have our problems but that doesnt mean that the government shuts us down it just means that the only reason we have those isssues are because not everything will go according to plan. 
"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a puicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." 
Many students are involved in extracurricular activities that are not school sponsored and are run by an organization outside of school. If school forces the students to join an activity, it will take up more time. 
But, the trust is rarely betrayed. 
the writer says that Venus, "has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." These features are exactly what earth has as well. 
In this article " unmasking the face on mars" they are showing us a picture that was taken by a 1976 viking 1 photograph of the face on mars which is just a natural landform 
I will agree to this task and make sure that other students and not using them during class. Students may not like either of these tasks, but everyone will use one. 
they will make the project easier for them to understand, 
when you ask multiple friends for their opinion, you get to hear all their opinions, and have a reliable source to base your decision off of. 
in the story it's saids that '' Face on Mars'' has since became a pop icon 
The article "Driverless cars are coming" is a very encouraging on the behalf of driverless cars. these cars would be very helpful to those who text and drive. Sergey Brin, cofounder to Google believes that soon noone should even need cars. 
Students could join a extracurricular activity because they need a hobby 
beacuse it will encourage more people to vote 
Not asking for advice before leaping onto a solution can make you regret it later on. 
a reduction in enviromental problems. 
On the other hand, some Americans have five reasons to keep our horrendous way to elect our president. 
How are they still learning if they are cleaning and out of school? But really they are learning about the true and real life. Not about your educations and school related, but how they are going to react and perform on people littering and keeping a clean environment. Sometimes the real life may help you in the school related life. 
The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking "Well what do you think of it?" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset. 
The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. 
In many situations, judgment can easily be corrupted. This can be caused by stress, deficient energy, or maybe just a busy schedule. With a corrupted field of judgment, decisions cannot be made with complete logic. In less then two minutes, someone's life can be changed. That is all it takes for a good or bad decision to be made. A great example is speeding up to a yellow traffic light rather than slowing down. There is a risk of crashing or getting pulled over, but also getting to the destination faster. The right decision may lead to a beneficial addition to the day. However, the wrong decision may lead to something grave. When making a decision, advice is a great way to try and stay on the right path 
There has not been any life found on Mars at this momment. 
However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change. 
instead on relying on someones trust worthyness we should have a system that counts the publics votes. When the elector is done with his final vote we would then see if he voted based on public votes. 
would allow students to learn at their own pace. 
and it is competitive 
This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade. 
I believe that it is worth it, and I would know. 
So i say you should go and get a extracurricular activity it would be fun! 
I beileve the author supports this acticle very well humans could survive on Venus. It would take time and work but I beileve it could happen. 
Some kids who enjoy a concept, or just want to learn as much information about something as possible, are limited to how much the teach talks about it. With online learning students can explore the internet and other sources to find all sorts of information on a topic. In classrooms, teachers have a teaching method they use and just have to hope it works for everybody. In online learning, there is several ways of learning like watching a video, reading notes, and using a review game. Online learning would allow students to use each method and whatever they think helps them best they can use. 
The laws on speed limits would definetly change. There would be a bunch more laws besides thatone that would change as well. 
The way that i see it is that the author put a lot of reseach into venus and study it 
In conclusion, you and I both know the Electoral College has some flaws, but overall, it makes sense to keep it the way it is. 
When you attempt to find love there are dangers. The one you have chosen may have a history of being unfit to hold a relationship, or just has a bad makeup due to their past and they don't feel like changing now. Venus is just like the signifacant other you are looking for. Whilst it is a planet, it has numours dangers like it's chemical makeup, temperature,etc. 
Driveways, home garages, and street parking and forbidden in the experiment of the outskirts on the nee district. In a place called Vauban's streets are completly "Car-free". The only places that are not car free are downtown near the tram. You can only have two places to park and those two places are home, and large garages only at the edge of the developement it costs $40,000. Fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here, and seventy percent of families do not own a car. They say "When I had a car i was always tense. Immuch happier this way". Suburbs have linchpin called automobiles. Up to fifty percent in some car- intensive areas in the U.S.. and up to twelve percent of green house gas emissions in Europe. A home to 5,500 residents withing a rectangular square mile, it may be the most advanced experiment in a low-car suburban life. They say " All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change". A fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the U.S. are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. The EPA is promoting a "car reduced" communities, and legislatrors are acting cautiously.Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, after days of near-record pollution. Odd and even numbered plates were threatened to keep there cars home or forced to lay of fine of $31. Just about 4,000 drivers were fined. Sixety percent of congestion was down. China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Taax policy favors Diesels over gasoline. Sixty-seven percent of diesels make up vehiclals, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Wetern Europe. There is typically more smog in Paris. There were one hundred and forty seven micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, and this is compared to one hundred and fourteen and 79.7 reuters found. According the the BBC, public transit was free of charge from friday to monday. The smog had cleared enought monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.Millions of Colonbians hiked, skated, biked, or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday. Cars have been banned for 3 years now in colombia, there are only taxis, and busses left there a seven million people in that city. The goal was to promote alternitive transportation and reduce smog, violatoors faced a tenty five dollar fine. They said "The rain hasnt stopped people from participating". "It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution". Cali and Valledupar, had joined the event. "These people are generating a revolutionary change". It has been seen to see one hundred and eighteen miles of bicycle paths. New restaurants and upscale shopping districts have ctopped up. Parks ans sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city. Rush hour restrictions have dramaticlly cut traffice. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. 
you should join the Seagoing Cowboys 
they didn't any thing bad i think only the bad people should do community service they do something bad they have to make it up for you but like that is up to you i am telling you what is on my mind of people want to help they can help but not all kids should do it 
Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a "Certificate of Ascertainment" witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.    
The Electoral College is right but not fair, althought it has its benifets, its has its defaults as well 
i agree 
You can't enjoy clubs if you don't talk to anyone. Clubs are meant to be fun and meant for everyone to have a good time. If you don't talk to people and socialize even a little bit, they aren't going to speak to you first. 
outdated 
For example, BMW developed the "Traffic Jam Assistant." This car could handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. This car also had special touch sensors to ensure the driver holds onto the wheel. Having cars that aren't fully driverless allows the driver to remain alert, so they can take over when there is a situation. This is a great thing about these cars. There are driver seats that vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into something. The Google car announces when the driver should take over. Other cars might have flashing lights or other signals that warn the driver to take control of the vehicle. 
There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. 
Summer projects are important for schools and teachers to implement whether it be student-designed or teacher-designed. However in the case of productivity, teacher-designed projects bear more benefits. School year flow, class content, and a student's work habits all play roles in why teacher-designed projects should be the main source of assignments given over the summer. 
Many don't focus upon their studies and teachers are time and time again to get them above their showing level of academics. Academics must have several students who try hard for their goal for whatever it is they want to do with their life. If somebody wants to be a millionaire, they have to work on being that throughout their life. Be a millionaire doesn't just come to you. You have to work your whole life for being this. If they want to be a hotdog man, a trash man, or even a McDonald's cashier, then they will have very little self-respect and very little low-self esteem. 
my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you. 
The basis for summer projects to assure continuous learning should be student-designed 
This example shows that they might of seen something else such as the face ,but it could be wrong because they captured the picture when there was wispy clouds. 
I think its ok so you can know how the person is feeling 
The author supports the idea of exploring venus 
but just telling the students to turn the phone of is not enough, 
What if the student just changes their apperance to make them look a different way when they are read for their emotion. 
The natural landforms that mars is making peope think that its made by aliens 
I am sorry to announce that the unfairness of the Electoral College to the Americna people, has come to my attention. As a fifteen year old highschool student, I will not have to worry about voting for quite some time. 
You just have to come up with some agreements you can come up with and share them with the students and see if they agree with you, and they disagree with you than just don't let them in the sport they sign up for. 
t that how they think i do not. 
Secondly, people who use a cell phone in the car can drive erratically, which puts others at risk 
Next one up , Repesitives . I know there is something like this but do this base on population . Like for every 10,000 there is one repesitive or something like that . This could be a cleaner and faster system than the one in the first paragraph 
the computer tell them what they are doing wrong and change it to where the classroom is fun but you also get alot of learning in. 
The process is unfair to the people because of the "winner takes all" system in each state the canidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more benefically to them 
By offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, they'll be able to continue their learning while not having to worry about falling behind or having to attend school later into the summer. 
Mona Lisa, when you hear her name you think of a women that doesnt look fazed at all, she looks like she has no emotion. Mona Lisa does, thanks to studies Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute foe Advanced Science found a way to tell emotion. 
counter-arguements 
I am here because I am giving my opinion on whether students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity 
Its like their security to let them know their safe. Maybe their being bullied and want to talk to someone about it. And they don't want to bring the principal into it all.They can text their mom or dad and resolve the issue. I think it is important to talk to them. Some kids have anger issues and can only be calmed down by loved ones. Only they can reach you. 
For expamle, say if the person is driving in one of these driveless cars and there not paying attention cause there on there phone and the thin the car will just do everything on its on. So it a accident now. Like it says in the passage"this means human drivers must remain alert and be readdy to takke over when the situation requires. You cant take over if your busy on your phone or eating food or doing something you wouldnt do if you was driving. So thats the down part. 
Could attending classes from home via online or video conference be a beneficial option that schools offer? 
You can travel the world and see places like China, Europe, Greece, and Italy. They have unique 
Touchdown! I just won the biggest game of the year. My team run on the field and we jump up and down in joy. This would not have happened if my principal did not make us take a school activity. 
Then everyone is told to adapt to the change and buy this self-propelling car, but they are much too costly. Without the car, people could get into accidents with the driverless car. No complete safety would be acquired until every single car within the set area is a driverless car. 
Why you should not need to take one extracurricular activity to pass the school year. The principle has decided that you need to take at lest one extracurricular activity to pass each school year. Here are some reasons 
The Popular States says that the electoral College system is out of date and lame , 
it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace 
He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do. 
I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road. 
There is very little equality when it comes to elections especially, when the states are giving an unreliable system to choose for them. 
and a facial software 
Teachers have more often than not been the epicenter of academic negativity. There always has been and always will complain about teaching styles. If students could take the steering wheel, chances are they will understand the material taught and retain that information. 
first scientists are researching a way to last longer to get to venus and land on it 
Avoiding more traumatizing events of physical and verbal bullying on school grounds will significantly increase the child's chances of performing at their best in acedemic as well as extracurricular activities. Even with some efforts to erradicate the event of school shootings with metal detectors and other techniques, students are utimately safer at home rather than on the schools vulnerable campus. 
The fact that Electors can refuse to vote for a president and the party their on what the people picked that elector for is ridiculous, because the Elector could just pick the President on the Republican side. 
Students will also be able to stay up to date with schoolwork if an illness or other injury prevents them from going to school for long amounts of time. 
One of the reasons i think that the Electoral College actually works is because The Electoral College works is because it process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress 
I tink it is a huge rock formation like said in the story. 
This assumption is made because, driving under the influence, as well as underage drinking are huge topics of discussion in today's society. Driverless cars would give these two groups of people an exscuse to commit these actions. They would no longer have to worry about the reproccutions of such crimes. Such as putting other's lives in danger or getting caught by the police. 
Plus we know that it is to hot for there to be living creatures. 
Changing the Election to popular vote instead of keeping the Electoral college is a much better idea if you ask me 
But like everything, there is a down side to living so close to the sun. 
For example if students don't attened to school they won't be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams. 
Without teachers life is hard, and educating yourself will deprive you of the learning experiences like the ones that I encountered. 
Yes you can see how that person is "feeling by looking at their face,"but some people can fake a smile to hide whats going on inside, some people are just scared to let their feeling out because they are worried someone it going to hurt them. 
My mom did Science Olympiad when she was younger, and was able to get to the national championship one year. Sadly, another team beat them, but my mom learned something very important that day. She learned that it was okay to loose, and how to accept that it will happen again in the future. Ever since then, when she lost something, she accepted it, and wasn't upset. My friend Generic_Name, from elementary school used to do track with me, but moved onto another sport. She was unbareably talented, and was as fast as a cheetah. When she won her first championship, she learned how to be humble, and learned not to think that she was better than anyone else on our team just because she won the championship. She didn't just do that though, she was able to encourage other people on the team to be humble as well, and not to brag if you did really good on something. In later situations, she knew not to brag or boast about the fact that she did better than someone else. Doing an activity helps people be better, and could help the students of the school be better as well. 
Venus is a planet that we can study, survived etc. But also it take a lot of time to do programs and prepare the people, also we are close to put the first step on Venus.thank you.... 
Some might say that student-designed projects allow a more personalized and creative component. Additionally, students will be able to design a project they enjoy learning. 
Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide show or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! 
For starters, the leader of the free world should be choosen directly by the American citizens 
The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the popular vote." A presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."This is a desirable result appeal is unlikelu to be a suffessful president". The electoral college restores some of the weight in the balance the large states lose by virtue. 
This cannot represent the will of the people. 
You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good. 
I'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home 
she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed. 
The electoral college is a fraud, 
One that really stood out was when he said that Venus was a lot like earth 
Personally I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. 
by partaking in extracurricular activities, your child can form stronger bonds, stronger friendships, and even new friends as well. 
As you know the Electoral College is a process, not a place. But do you think many other people know that. They might get a hint 
Instead of hiding those facts he or she adds them on making it more intresting. All the information that is being given is making you want to study it more even if it dangerous. It shows that he supports the studdying of it and knows the worth and most that goes on. 
I think that having electorals college is a great idea for our counries 
Not all drivers pay attention to the road while driving (especially teens) and riding in a driverless car, coming into a situation that requires a human being to take control of the wheel can lead to accidents if they're not paying attention. The rates of car accidents are already high till this day, just imagine how high the rate would be having driverless cars. It may not even be the drivers fault, a glitch can happen with the car causing it to get into a accident injuring somebody, as said in passage 9; who's fault would it be then? The person or the manufacturers fault? That is my first reasoning opposing driverless cars. 
Today, many cars all across America and the world have road assistance and antilock breaks, but this still gives drivers the oppurtunity to make a mistake and cause an accident. 
Now throughout this response i have said/typed what I think is, in a way, best for the school and that is to carry out with the no cell phones in school policy. Because the student might lose his/her cell phone or other electronic device. 
There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better. 
The way we like to live is the better wa, not being forced on how to live our lives. It is also a faster prosses to vote. If the group all are equal then they have to wait a longer time to see who the presedent is going to be and no one wants that. If i can ask you one question its going to be "how long will you be willing to wait to see who the new presedent id going to be?" The people of nthe united states dont want to wait, they want to see who the presedent is going to be the week after they vote.Can we live the way we want to live? can we live our lives without something happening that changes everything? Most of the time no, there is always something/someone that changes things in our lives. Like in 2001 the twin towers got hit by a plane, that changed everything. the way we go through airports, the way we fly, the way how people find jobs, and how people look and their beliefs. Some people are judged by what they do for living or what they look like , but thats the point of freedome in the united states. If we have a popular vote in the US they most of that will change and i can garantee that more laws will be fast that will help the US. 
The bad thing about Electoral Colleges is if there a run-off election 
his method is more democratic 
they give human beings reasons to not get out of their house 
But if it was by popular vote then the people that don't vote will make a big impact because you will need more votes to win the election. 
Again skepics were not satisfied, the picture was taken on a cloudy day over Mars. So they began to ask questions like; What if the alein markings were hidden by haze? 
Some people might have a lot of knowledge about the topic you are making your decision on. for example lets say you are trying to decide where to go on your camping trip. The first person you talk to could have only gone camping once but the fifth could have been going camping for years. This person would know a lot about camping and all of the different camping sites; which ones are good and which ones are bad. If you had only talked to that one person than you could of picked a terrible camp site and had an awful overall experience but because you talked to more than one person you ended up getting more knowledge about campsites and had a terrific time camping. 
If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count. 
We have seen it and belive that it is just a mesa. 
For many people they don't like only asking one person for advice because somebody might give better advice than someone else 
It takes the power to choose the goverment officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way 
because it would adjust lesson plans 
And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. 
For such a small device it can distract many people. 
Kids of all age face the chance of being bullied in their education years. There will be a chance of a student being pulled regardless of the learning environment. At home away from others may seem like it will prevent bullying but it won't. Through social media kids can be targeted and parents may not always know that this is happening because kids won't know what to do 
When making a project these things are what you look forward too. Students need their minds to go wild and enjoy the project especially if it's over the summer. Their summer to be specific because no student would want to stay at home stuck doing a project if it's not fun for them. Especially if their friends are out having fun. 
Thats one reason why asking more than one person can help people make a better choice 
when its summer break i love to go off and have fun with my friends and family, we always are out doing something weather it be hanging around the house or off on a trip somewhere, other students dont do this and it is honestly really cool, last summer my girlfriend and i went down to nags head with her family, i had the most fun time while we were down there, even though i accidentally left my wallet at her house. 
As you seek multiple opinions, you can see different sides of the issue that you maybe didn't know about. While this happens, you can find minor issues in your argument or point of view. These issues can be easily resolved before you make the decision, but after the decision happens, it is final and cannot be changed. By asking many people their ideas, you can get a better selection of viewpoints and opinions, just like in a research project, where you want to get information from multiple sources, not just ones that you agree with. When you combine all three of these reasons, you can find the better outcome that there is to be chosen from in your decision that you are making. Furthermore, with these multiple views, you will most likely get correct advice. 
because it revokes the need for transportation routes 
A teacher will be able to design one that prepares the students well for the upcoming curriculum 
The summer project should be a teacher-based project because it informs the teacher of what is happening and what they are doing during the project, it helps the student learn what they need to maintain in their brain during the summer, and it also makes sure the project is not to easy or hard for the students. 
And if a student has to leave their town they would be able to keep up with their work. 
In civics class, students are taught the difference between popular vote and electoral vote. However, seventh grader do not learn the entirety of it, seeing as learning about the Electoral College may affect how they see the country they live in. Popular vote, to my understanding, is the number of votes a candidate recieves from the American people . Electoral vote, the thing that determines who becomes president, is done by the Electors determined when voters chose which candidate they wanted to win. Electoral vote, and popular vote are not the same thing, for instance one could win the popular vote, yet lose the electoral vote. Why is this? 
the project can be less confusing, 
Driverless cars are another one of the world's technological marvels, that not only take away the prevalent nuisance of driving for long periods of time, but in terms of safety and efficiency, prevail. 
Being taught online isin't always a good idea 
I think its not a good idea of technology reading our emotions 
I also know some kids wont be happy about this, 
The computer can help a teacher/adult to understand when a student is in need of a talk or needs to express their emotions 
Based of the information they staed in the passage i do believe that the teachnology called Facial Action Coding System can identify human emotion. 
The distances methods are a good way to learn ,also is a goog advancen where teh students get benefit to learning and inprobe their studys spend time in online classes is the better and easy way to preparate students for the future. 
Driverless cars have come a long way and are still in the process of being perfected. New, developed features have different advantages such as the advanced sensors that repsond to dangerous situations and the signals that allow the reader to remain alert. Overall, I think that driverless cars are a major innovation and can be very effectful and beneficial for drivers. 
Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices 
it's basically a gamble. you come with electors, hope for the best and if your luck is good you leave with a jackpot, but sadly if you dont get the jackpot you lose all. 
Online learning is a controversial topic among traditional and modern educators. The rivalry between face to face classes and online classes is not necessary. Encouraging students to use their resources to learn in the best way for them is what is most important. All students have different learning abilities and strategies; some people struggle to abide by the strict school rules which takes away from their learning experience. Some may argue that learning through a computer cannot compete with traditional schooling, but there are significant benefits to both 
"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow." 
i also think many things shouldn't change like trying something different 
It makes sure that they get to a place where someone will take good care of them, or use them for milk, meat, eggs, and other things. The seagoing Cowboys program is very useful. 
Second, in the Everyone's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, "Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win". 
In conclusion, doing an after school activity is all up to the parent and and student. In my opinion I wouldnt because of the time it takes, and hard times that it might bring you in like those photographers and sports people. 
Another reason why school help is that some student many not have the money to own an electronic or many have really bad connection to the internet. 
the best option for society is to not have driverless cars because, they promote less disciplined actions with teen and adult drivers, they would not benefit the economy, and finally these driverless cars put safety features at risk compared to having an able-bodied human to do the manual functions when presented them. 
The reason being is if a kid is upset about what happen at lunch and doesnt want the teacher to know the teacher shouldn't know 
Third of all, any student that has to stay at home or be hospitalized due to a sickness would be able to continue their education. 
First of all,Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. 
It said the cowboys played baseball,volleyball,table tennis tornaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games that help pass time so 
Theorists have not studied the landform as much as we have. How can people think that the Face is created by aliens when theres absolutely no proof of their existance? 
It is very important for young adults to want to take part in their community, and to want to build leadership skills. 
Large states as Texas, California, and Minnesota would have a "winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. People not in those states would get angry and things would get bad. It takes 270 out of 538 to be elected president and if changing to popular vote for the election would be thelargest state elector would be the president. 
For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day.  
Also in the story it says "It once haunted a grocery store check out line for 25 years.". That is just crazy that peope will believe things like that ! Sometimes people just want to scare other people and tell them lies about anything. Some people think that the face is "bona fide" evidence of life on Mars. People say that NASA wants to hide every reason from them so they do not find out anything. 
Not all students are the same and their varied conditions may affect their opportunity to obtain an education. Distance learning is a new innovative technique that some schools implement to offer online education at home. This technique can be offered in many ways such as: online video, conferencing, and online courses. Distance learning can be very beneficial for all students in any level of education 
Having a easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. 
Though it would be a big step, it would not be a step in the right direction. 
That's my arguement on this topic. People just fail to see that because of the electoral college, everything is going great, the judgement is fair, and everything is balanced 
The author supports this idea by giving the facts of how dangerous it is but why we should keep trying to study Venus 
If each student was doing at least one after-school activity students will be able to show their uniqueness and collectively create a diverse learning experience for everyone at school. 
My next and final reason is if school was online we would not have to wake up early in the morning to attend school. 
The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect emotions 
Sometimes when a decision is very impactful, you can get stressed out over the choice you want to make. Asking others may make deciding easier because all you have to honestly do is listen to their ideas and decide if you agree with them or not. Then, using your common sense and their advice, you can choose the decision you believe is best for you . Also, you actually might know what you are going to choose. But you might still want to ask other people what they think because that can "confirm" that you have made the right decision. 
As in the article it says not all scientists beleived it was an alien im not saying none of them did but some of them didnt 
Everyone has their own desires and values in life, even students. Though one may be attending school, they could also be wrapped up in another area of their life. Many students enrolled in schools right now do not only just focus on schoolwork, rather they are involved in many out-of-school actives. For example, students model, dance, make videos on the internet, and participate in travel sports. Having such a busy schedule, being able to get one's school work done outside of school can be very useful to many, because then they can try their best to fit everything into their schedules at any time or place of the day. All in all, having the work done, rather than not, is more beneficial to both students and teachers. 
Knowing if there's someone with a family who is out on the streets trying to be alive is just sad. People can do concerts, plays, and just washing people cars could help earn money for he charity. By doing this, you could be helping lots of other people who needed shelter. 
One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. 
To me this isn't all the way driveless driving its more like the car assistaing you most of the time. And this could also cause problems betweem the drivers and the companys responible for these cars . 
In conclusion, there are many benefits from being able to attend school classes from home through online school or video conference calls. Some examples include: reduced stress, ability to fulfill other responsibilities and prioritize hobbies, and finally, develop valuable skills that will assist with success in the online course and life after high school. Generic_School is very aware of the damage some students suffered from because they were compelled to attend school away from home, so they instituted the Hybrid Program and Virtual Generic_School, which allows the students to take either all their classes from the comfort of their home, or just a few so they take a few courses in the building and others at home. This gives the students the power to control their schedules and make their high school experience and academic load less stressful.            
My step sister, Generic_Name, use to do online classes from our home because she suffers from a physical illness that doesn't allow her body to produce enough blood cells. Because my step sisters body does't produce enough blood cells this effects her body to get tired very quickly. Generic_Name can't stand up for long amounts of time and can't preform as much physical activity as others. When Generic_Name preforms too much physical activity, that her body cant obtain, she will get very light-headed and feel as if she's going unconscious. If Generic_Name puts her body at too much physical risk, she could possibly have a seizure. Online classes were very beneficial for my step sister, Generic_Name, because it allowed her to be at rest when learning. 
Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.This creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.All in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
online classes can help those who tend to be more shy than others are. 
The schedule of a student attending any learning facility is made up of a list of their designated classes. A typical school day for them is to come to school, attend all the classes listed to them on that specific day, and go home. However, some schools offer distance learning for a student which is mainly a way for students to attend class at home through the use of video conferencing or taking the class online 
And they are just talking and talking. 
I think that if you require students to volunteer for community service I know that some of them will be really mad because they think its a waste of time 
the Electoral Collge is not democratic at all. 
You the principal should think about this we should have more students play sports. and also have free time . But if we have torturing we should have it for students that want help and that . Like if we had a activity to go on a fill trip we should go to one . 
Us fellow citizens of the united states only want whats best for us. We may not be as smart as the people in the electoral college, but that sure wont stop us from knowing who we like and who we think is better for our country. We deserve as much right to have our own president as much as anyone in the elecotral college does. 
The nice thing about getting off ealer then the elementary school kids is when you get out of school you can walk to there school then wait for your siblings. But if you are required to stay after school then you cant walk them to the house which would mean that they would walk by them self or a parent would have to quit there job to make sure there child gets home safely. 
they will always be learning. 
critisim constructive or not 
One of the things is that they are still striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. 
Imagine if a person is trying to open a farm, but the person's best friend hates all farmers. The best friend has a biased opinion towards farmers and hates all of them. When the person asks the best friend if they should start a farm, naturally the best friend will say no. But if the person asks someone who loves animals and the outdoors, that person would say they should open a farm. If the person had only asked the biased best friend who hates farms, they would now not have a job and place to live that they are happy with. This is one example of why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice because people have biased opinions. What if a girl wants to try out for a football team. All of her friends say that is gross and annoying because girls can not play football. This is a biased opinion about girls who play football. While all of the girl's teachers and family say that is a great idea and the change the school needs. If she would not have asked her teachers, she wouldn't be on the team. That is why you should ask multiple people before making an important choice like starting a farm or joining the football team. 
In the article it says that"The electoral college requries a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president".  the winner take all methid means that who ever wins the elction they become president and they also have a winner to become  State Senator. The president has to become sworn in befor he actually starts the job. 
Everyone see's something different in a president, we will see good and bad things. There are five very good reasons why we should keep our despised methode of choosing the president, which is known as the electoral college 
they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. 
The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. 
i think its fair and that everyone should be used to it by now because we have been doing it for a long time. 
Venus, somethimes called the "Evenig Star" is the closest planet to Earth. this planets have differents such as, the size between their, the speed that they move around the sun, this speed mean tht sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.The big question here is, why humans never visited this planets in more l tha three decades. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, no since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.However, Venus can provide only limited insinght on ground conditions because most forms on light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. 
Everyone should get the chance to stay after school just once, and if they don't like it they don't have to continue staying in an after school program. 
In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming", the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. How do i feel about driverless cars? 
Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. That year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from "Phantom Menace" to "The Jedi Return". But i decided to write about "Revenge of The Sith" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. I honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one I was and still am a pretty weak writer. But eventually I came around to write about Anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. Now keep in mind I had finished about a week into summer so I was pretty much free to do what I wanted. That same summer I had traveled to Honduras for 2 and a half months to visit. But as soon as I returned school was satrting and I had completely forgotten about the assignment and to put the icing on the cake It was lost. 
If they put this into a classroom more kids would want to go to class because it can make class better. 
Asking for multiple inputs for the topic of advice, hits very close to home for me.After I moved from the United Kingdom to United States of America.I was sad and had the feeling of anxiety of talking to and meeting new people as I had made so many friends in the UK and no one in America wanted to talk to be or be my friend.I felt like I wasn't meant to be in this world, but then my dad took me into our formal dining room and sat me down.I talked to him about the whole situation and told him about my worries and asked him for advice.He gave me advice on how to cope and to deal with situation.I had suddenly felt a lot better.I then started to be more open about my feelings and talked to multiple people like my school consular, mom, brother and even a classmate.Now I have a lot of friends that I can rely and depend on because of the advice I took from multiple people.Therefore, asking for advice from more than one person can change or have a huge impact on someones life. 
you ask different people. You might need advice for many different things 
Although following a specific guild line ensures the student will complete the required task thoroughly, it forbids the act of joy. Students are already in school for ten months of the year following a stricted guideline in how to complete a certain assignment, if schools assign a teacher-designed project over the summer it would feel as if they are coming in the way of students summer break. If this project is teacher-designed it would also show students that schools are more biased towards their opinions. 
On a usual school assignment students wait till the last minute and stress about what to and how to do it, with being able to design your project there would be less procrastination and more completion. With student-design projects each student has more options in what they can create, making them look forward to completing the task with excitement. Most school assignments don't entertain students while accomplishing them, if schools let students design their summer project they can make it fun. For an example, a group of students can plan on working on this project together and be enthusiastic because their options are open and would also give them the ability to help each other with new ideas. 
When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors 
these students understand where the new students are coming from 
by seeking more than one person for advice it helps you get the support you need to make new and smart choices. 
With the ability to work online, you not only have the comfort of being at home 
The electoral college has so many flaws such as the disaster factor 
It says "moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them''. I think that is very true and hopefully it would make people more happy and not feel like they are nothing. 
The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the "President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."-Source 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1.The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. "Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators."-Paragrah 2,What Is the Electoral College.Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party. 
In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. 
the machine can even track if were angry and how our lips tighten around our mouth 
That important text you need to answer or send can wait a couple minutes while you get to somewhere safe. Risking your life and others just to get that good quality picture is not worth it. People around you that care about you, will truly understand that you couldn't answer in that exact moment.      
You'll make new friends along the way, too! 
because what if the student don't listen to the policy and they have there phones out during classes and there texting during there class and when the teacher ask what is the answer to "2836/847 they don't the answer how they be able to learn. 
You might pass a light or someone might be crossing the street and you won't be able to see that person. You're putting others people life in danger. 
For example, my ninth grade English teacher was so focused on preparing us for our final that she didn't have enough time to design a summer project. This shows that if students were to design their own summer projects, teachers would have less work and more time to focus on grading and teaching. 
Like, say that you say we have to do it on a Saturday at 9:00am to 12:00pm not everybody can make that time. 
This is what I think the author suggests to the study of venus because venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk and maybe should think of them for a challenge, because astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere, and venus is simple to see from the distant but can be safe vantage point in earth and has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely to it. 
So many people die every year from recklace drivers or people driving under the infulence, limiting car usage would drop these numbers down drasically and make life for us way safer. 
Driverless cars have been the seemingly unattainable, next level of fantastic futuristic technology for many people for decades now. 
There will be more stuff we can put in the recycling bin instead of throwing it away we can renew it save on killing in trees that we killing in rainforest. animals in water will not die if we don't throw things in sewers. 
Government teachers assign summer project that help students learn laws that can keep them safe and away from prison and also help save others. It also helps them learn about their state Governor and how they are helping the people in the city that they live in and how they can help bring about change to things that they might not like. Teacher based projects keep students connected with the outside world. 
Good Afternoon, You may know me as Dr. Ema R. I'm Head Scientist down at NASA. So today I'm going to tell you about the 'Face on Mars' some people think its just a funky looking rock. Well my friends they are wrong. Now your going to move on to my studying and research I have done to find out what it is and I'm pretty sure I found the right answer. 
My opinion is that the teachers pick up their cell phones before class this might be bad if they steal them. 
You can help people and animals when needed. 
We don't have anywhere else to go if we keep killing earth 
n the opening paragraph of the article, the author states, "the cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis." Less fuel used for automobiles would empower the United States to spend less money on oil and natural gas imports. Additionally, less fuel polution released by cars would help make the enviroment a safer place for current and future generations. 
With the help of trustworthy and honest peers, your decision is a lot more dependable. Hearing what others believe to be true tends to help. You have to remember to ask trustworthy people, and even then your decision may not be a good one. Even some of the smartest people in America, including our president, congress, and all of the houses ask for opinions from the people. Sure a few bad choices have been made, but I strongly feel the good heavily outweigh the bad. I also believe that the good outweigh the bad on even tiny decisions made day to day when you have multiple different perspectives. You can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small. 
I mean think about about it, why would we hide evidence that would benefit this whole organization? Most of the people here at NASA wish that there was an early civilization on Mars. If we did find life on Mars we would share it world wide, it would be one of the greates scientic breakthroughs in history. 
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. In doing this, students may be prepared for the upcoming year when they return to school from break. Many people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed while others believe that they should be student-designed. 
because lets say your driving to another state an you dont want to drive for number of hours all you have to do is just switch to autopilot an have the car drive it self seems like a good idea doesnt it? Though it seems like a great idea from google...Did google ever stop an think about the saftey of others? Did google stop an think about safety period? 
So from all of the information from this article it is confirmed that "The Face" isn't really a extraterestrial artifact, but just a measly illusion.  
On the other hand, it has not changed at all only to stay unfair towards the entire country and possibly cause a catasrophe. 
As time progresses, so do classroom education and the technological innovations applied to it. While teachers search for helpful methods to engage their pupils in education, the world of science develops more and more inventions, such as the Facial Action Coding System, to improve standards of living 
i mean ow could such a puniy creater make such a fuse over a interesting face. Aliens are not real!!When Fred was rantting about how it had to be an alien and nothing else could have made thoose faces i was thinking that he might have gone crazy 
with things like electronic devices, or persons like childrens, and any other distract thing. 
NASAreleasing it in the hopes while it was coming to public. To sale in stores and area in business ,and it did. Hoping it to be real so we can lead people into the existence of it being real. 
If you put this policy to good use, you, as the principal can find out what really is going on around the school. 
the surfce was rockey and couldnt be walled on because of that reason or drove on there was mountains and craters furthermore. the nationL aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. 
its not fair to the kids who are working hard and trying their best to keep there grades up while playing a sport at the same time. 
In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students. While some say that students should design the projects as they know what they can handle, teachers have a degree in knowing what a student can handle. Also, teachers know what to teach to the students to prepare them for the coming year, and most students will not push themselves hard enough while making the project. Thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they truly know what the student would benefit from. 
There are a lot of things you need to realize with driving and texting. First of all if you do it you need to be cautious and smart about it 
But other conspiricy theorists think otherwise. 
Nowadays there are so many collisions occurs on highway roads in U.S. 
Most people would like it for extra credit for certain classes. 
When you ask multiple people for advice it is good 
You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities. 
currently the when you cast your vote you are acctually voting for your candidate's electors whos votes do not become valid until [they] the electors are voted for by the [you] the people. A few problems with this process is expressed in an artical titled "The Indefensible Electoral Colledge" 
The author is aware of the fact and describes how, "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, "clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers 
Reason are that because some student may not have time to do it student may plan out of town trips with family, 
As stated in the "Driverless Cars Are Coming" article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that his idea of a driverless car public transport system would use half the feul as today's taxis. As our feul is a fossil feul, meaning one day it will run out, using as little of it as possible is much more than just a good thing. Also, using this idea of a driverless car public transport system would save us a lot of money. Not having to drive your own car and fill it up every week would save you quite a bit on gas money. Also, you would not have to pay for repairs or damages to your vehicle. 
In the passage it says" If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similiar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." With the new software doing that it would save alot of frustration from having to click the x button on all the ads that you dont care for. 
A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things 
I think we should get rid of the the Electoral College. And I know that many other people in this country would agree. I think that is should be changed to the popular vote for the President of the United States. 
yeah it was created by the founding fathers,and we should respect there great legacy, 
getting advice could be a good thing, since many different people have all had vastly different experiences. 
The author tells in the text, "We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day." But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look 
So with that being said that backes my argument up even more. And it isn't just Georgia there is so many other states that have it to. So we all know if the government has a law on it its a real problem. If caught breaking this law you can be written a ticket 50 dollars or more depending if its is your first offence or not. 
If they don't pay attention, it could cause wrecks, accidental turns, who knows? You might end up at the wrong place. Lawmakers themself even agree that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Also, if we went driverless, it would give drunks an "ok" to drive because technically, they aren't driving.. which would cause a whole nother problem.If we went driverless, it would look cool for awhile, but eventually everything would crash. The cars might not be programmed correctly, people would put the blame on the car and not themself, it would cost us a tremendous amount of more money. From the actual car itself; to all the problems it would cause. 
Venus might have the "hottest surface temperture of any plant in our solar system" (paragraph 3), erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes. But it still has features like earth. venus has rocky sediment. It also has mountains and craters like it states in paragraph 4 
for some students it is the only option. 
I think that community service is very important 
For the kids that do not participate in community service, well why don't they? It is a fantastic way to help others and there is no reason why not to do it. 
Many times, people voting for a candidate get confused on who they are voting for, and often get confused. 
Most states in the electoral college is based on a "winner take all" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after "swing states" (Source 2).  If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3). 
And thats why I favor in popularity votes because its more fair for the canidates and its a better system in electing a president.            
For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. 
because some people not have a the same beneficts and this people need other thins like others helps and i thing school need other things not onle classes online or classes in the home because they dont know how is the life te other peoples ans when school have a this thins like classes oline and classes in te home they need put estrited rulers for students they make a shure when students take a classes and they need have a god teachers and good ideas for students take a classes and not have preblems when they need graduate, because sometimes students have a problemes for graduate and that not is good. 
By improving public transport we reduce car usage which improves the enviroment and quality of life. 
Schools that assign summer projects should give students the privilege to explore their interests, while encouraging creativity. Furthermore, schools that assign summer projects should allow students to design their own project because all students are under different circumstances and students should be allowed to be creative, especially in environments outside of school. 
If our school system made extra curricular activities mandatory the first problem would be the amount of space needed to support the students activity. 
the presidental election is realized every four years after the first monday of November. When the presidental election is done the governor of each state has to prepare a Certificate of Arcertainment how the Federal Register says. Not only keep the electoral college allow to vote just for their president , they also when they are voting for their president they are voting for their electoral. 
they are much safer than the standard car with a human driver. 
A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. "If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others. 
Me and my partner have came to a conclusion that it was landform. That there is still no site of Aliens. That dosen't mean we woun't stop looking. 
I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home 
First attend classes at home they can benefit for student 
I feel like you should give the people more of a say because half of the people that vote problably don't even know that they are not actually voting for the president. They probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college to see who will end up on the board. 
I understand what Richard is saying and he has lots of evidence to back his oppinion up, but i disagree with him. 
be more certain 
in the artical the autoer shows how they would like to see venus get explored dispite the harsh condisons and odd wether 
student that are smart will do the project 
you could try a new idea. 
In addition to enriching their current lives, online education and the independence and initiative that comes with it prepares students much more thoroughly for higher learning experiences than any in-building experience could. 
The monument was another natural formation. It is stated in the fourth passage, that it is giving an illusion to the shadows and making it look like it has eyes, nose, and a mouth." Evidence say in the fifth passage say that NASA would wather hide, and say that conspiracy theorists. 
Student-designed summer assignment's would result in a relaxed, but still productive and educational summer that will help better prepare student's in the upcoming school year. 
I think that a lot of people are judging driverless cars by the way they are working now. We shouldn't give up on them so soon; Scientific discoveries happen all the time. Someone will find something that completely changes driverless cars for the better. Besides, they already show so much promise. In test drives, these cars could survive more than half a million miles without a crash. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by 2020. Let's wait until then to judge driverless cars. 
Luke was a solider in World War 1 and he was stationed in Europe,during this time war was going on and this wasn't the best time to visit there. But it's a more safe invorment and is known for it's history including the "World War 1". When you've had a lot going on at work, just want to do something nice for the kids,or even just tired of the weather a vaction is perfect for many reasons such as the ones I've mentioned. It's also very easy to become stressed and overwheled by work and school;its just best to take a break for it all. You can just go to a beach on an tropical Island or a jungle then come back to a fresh start ready to go,before you know you'll already be planing your next trip back or somewhere esle. You'll also get to meet new people around the world maybe you'll decide to move there. 
the citizens deserve to vote on who ever they think will help are country. 
Also, our school offers an excellent class called health. Moreover, they tell us that we should exercise because it helps us in the long run. But, if we take that away because of grades the kids may become more lethargic and not being able to even keep up with a C average! The effects would make the child's grade lower and possibly their status as a student would drop also. 
Also because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them .I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/daad get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad . 
"Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. 
Service hours are very helpful in the future. For example high schools, and colleges look at your community service hours and there is a greater percentage that you may get in that school. If they know that you are helpful to others, they would know that you would be helpful in their school. 
"Generic_Name what do you think about Sauce Mixer 3? It has 200 reviews and they're all positive," Generic_Name asked. "I think you should get it if its got mostly positive reviews" Generic_Name replied, "What do you think Generic_Name?" "Well I think you should get Cheese Factory Simulator, its got the same amount of reviews with 94% of them being positive, and it's $8 cheaper than Sauce Mixer 3!" Generic_Name replied. Making a better choice can not only help you now, but it can also benefit you later when the price of the game might go up! Making a better choice can mean you have more of a certain resource to spare so you can donate extras to charity or some other organization. Not having that extra bit of money could mean you wouldn't have enough money to have nice food, or any food at all, until you have more money. 
Students should undoubtedly make the summer packet for upcoming students. In the past, teachers have made a long, boring, and useless summer projects. In the future, students should find that their summer projects aren't a disservice. Teachers can now give students the opportunity to create summer projects that keep students engaged in learning over there rejuvenating break. 
Last but not least, the figure/landform similar to a "face" is actually a mesa! 
Would you be willing to figure out what is going on in Vebus? In the articule The Challenges of Exploring Venus there are scientist that want to find more about Venus. Venus is referred to as Earth's "twin". Would you be willing to explore or send Items to explore Venus, so we can know more about it? 
it can boost their confidence, 
I believe that the Electoral College vote should be abolished 
you may be getting bias information if you only take advice from one person 
Since Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, the distance are similar too. This planet has different speeds. Though, humans have sent many spacecrafts to this dangerous land. Each mission was unmanned sicne no spacecraft ever survived the landing for a few hours. 
But that is my reasen why i would go with policy one. 
On April 5, 1998 a team of men snapped a photograph ten times sharper than the one the Viking took. Once the photo was uploaded many people were unhappy. The people still believed it still had something to do with the aliens because of where it was located 
Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an "Evening Star" when its actually a planet. With Venus being provern a very challenging place to examine, ist hard to find out more abiut it. 
All Americans do is drive everywhere,they never think about how driving effects the air and the temperature of this planet. Maybe we can be like Africa and have nothing at all. Or just maybe appreciate that we actually have something. Why would we ever get rid of cars? I do not know,but i do know that getting rid of cars is really stupid. Well as i was asked im now going to explain to you how getting rid of cars is "good". 
This policy is trying to prevent students from sharing test answers in class. 
However, people fail to realize that driving cars is damaging our earth. 
Thirdly, another evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this tehnology to read students emotional expressions is in the text where the text states " The process begin with the computer model of the face .....then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. paul eckman......for example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ......" . from this evidence i should already know that i am for this technology and i agree with it being used to read students emotional expressions. I agree with it being used to read students emotinal expression, because just from the first four words of the quote i know that is is definently dependable 
Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe."It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality." 
In the article the author provides information about the planet to inform the reader that even though it may be hard and risky that it'd be outstanding to be able to put humans on the planet, 
They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car. 
The Electoral College adds there votes to everyone elses and then elects the president they want. But what about the people who didnt vote? Everyone should have a chance to vote. It wouldnt be fair that the Electoral College elected a president when theres people out there who didnt even have the chance to vote 
Yes this may just be a small few projects they do over the summer 
There are many advantages to limiting car usage. 
It's not right to have a few people have just as big of a say as hundreds of thousands of people. 
you create a stronger bond with the teacher. 
they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice. 
If every state had tghe same rulls do you think it would be more fair to all the states? 
The last reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because it would be a easy and simple process 
It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it. 
Wisdom is one of the most important things you will ever receive. Wisdom can be received or given by anyone such as your peers and elders. Everyone you meet will always have a choice to make therefore for every choice you have to make daily will effect your life forever. Some however will not be as big as others deciding what you will have fir dinner is no where as big of a decision as what you will do when your house burns down or you lose your job. 
if your close friend is in a different mind set as you and he/she is confused with what is going on or dont understand yall can help each other to understand and get to know whats going on in the situation and how to get a good answer and result.                               
So if there were to have bad grades, You could tell them either you do better or do community service. 
because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." 
Like i said if an alien did this we would have know by now 
Student designed projects give students the choice to pick a format they feel comfortable with. This choice gives the student confidence in their ability to complete the project and strengthens a particular skill in use. 
Stated in source 2, " Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanksto the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now." In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continure with an Electoral college. 
they thought that the face was a "bona fide" evidence of life on Mars. the face was everywhere it appeared in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows,and even haunted grocery stores. In September 1997 the Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program sent a [MGS] Mars Global Surveyor to take a pictuer of the face. 
In overall the eletoral college should stay due to the fact that the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries, a disaster only happend once and finally is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.  so let's not try new stuff keep the electoral college. 
The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results. 
Less polution polution is really bad in alot of countries i mean its so bad that its kind of hard to breathe i mean it would suck if yoy were on vacation in the carrabians trying to enjoy a nice tropical day outside but you can't why because you can bearly breathe with all that polluted air around so yea. 
Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well 
Multiple teens who already stress because of school have to also handle a job on top of that just to buy a car. Some even have to give up activities they love because of their jobs. Adults spend thousands of dollars just to buy cars and then have the risk of having to spend even more money when they break down to repair them. Cars are expensive items and the money we spend on them could go to other things like vacations, bills, and food. 
I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. 
Plus it would help reduce our garbage near and around roads, highways, schools, homes, work places, and public areas which would help make a big difference. If you recycled everything you picked up then you would be reducing greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere and making a small step towards a green planet 
Students might prefer staying home and doing assignements instead of waking up for school early,they'll have a chance to sleep in and do school work in the afternoon or at night. Teachers can benefit from online classes because some teachers have young children that need caring and help,teachers will be able to easily take care of them while attending school from home. Teachers will able to teach a whole class while sitting on their couch and even while eating at home or at a restuarent. Being able to attend classes online for students is a great way because traveling far distances or for long period time can be easier,Students won't have excuses on why their assignements weren't done. Students can easily work on their missing assignements because of the option of distance learning from home and being able to video conference teachers. 
I think these projects should be teacher-designed because in my opinion it would be better and it would actually help them more. 
Mason still didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural landform. 
To continue, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the majority of Americans followed the consititution when voting. 
Technology is a valuable resource for students. The new technology called the "Facial Actions Coding System" would be great for students. 
Most teachers tell their students to recycle their paper if they don't need it anymore. Most of the student will not hear or ignore what the teacher had said and they throw the paper away into the trash bin. One of the positive reason would be that more trees would be save and the usage of paper would reduce 
In addition, if teachers continue to design the majority of the students summer time projects, consequently, the project assigned will be either completed to its minimum rather to its maximum, and not to mention the overall quality would definitely be dramatically decreased 
But don't get me wrong there is some people who would rather learn from a teacher and be able to ask live questions. Maybe even find learning from home could be a distraction because of siblings and things of that nature. 
For example, one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor.He enjoys it a lot, especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them. 
Also it looked alot more like a face in 1976 because the landform is changing and moving so the "face" moves and changes with it. 
I strongly feel that if you are in a good community that you've been in for a while, you should at least take your time and pay the community back somehow. 
Although there is this talk of a car that can drive without a human, we have not seen a car that is reliable and safe enough to be trusted without the driver being ready to take over when needed. 
With that work we can explain and understand better about the problems with that planet and have ideas to a better study. 
First of all, the Electoral College system creates a window of opportunity for "faithless" electors to take advantage of the power given to them by society during the voting process. 
The author continuously describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, 
although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.         
For example, if a teacher was buying a new car, they would want to spend as much time as possible researching for the best car they could buy. However, even if they spent that much time, they could still end up buying a car that they end up not liking. Although if they asked others for advice, others may be able to share things from their own experience. They may have owned the car that the teacher wanted previously. If the teacher asked them whether it was a good purchase or not, they could share things that the teacher would have never found on the internet. Now the teacher has learned a lot more and has more information to make the right decision. That is why when others share their ideas, it could help someone make a better choice. 
Plus, when you gain advice, you yourself may also be able to help people. From personal experience, I know that I have gained a lot of knowledge from other people telling me a few simple words. I have also been given bad advice for my current situation, but I have found it very helpful later in life. A lot of people don't refer back to old information, because they are so used to constantly gaining more. I think the reason for that is because of work and school, it;s human nature to constantly gain new information. By asking others for advice, you are not only helping yourself, but you are also helping the people that will come to you for advice in the future. Just few words can change the a persons life. 
If you believe it is not enough you start asking more questions like why or how and if you cannot answer those it is not the best choice for you.When asking for advice it does not mean that you have to follow it.If you follow every piece of advice that you get then your life is going to be boring and have no action.It is never good to ask one person for advice and follow it. 
If everybody gets a chance to help out the community I think we should take it! It would be great doing something to give back to our community seeing that not many people are interested in helping out. 
So what im saying is if you find the right thing for you your out of the ball park. You have a chance to get away from the world and do what you love doing when your not doing school work or other things like that. You have a chance t be yourself without people judging everything little thing that goes on in your life. Plus if your really goos at it you could do your passion for a living whe your older like you could get a job that has something to do with something your really interested in and getting paid a little better than you would doing something thats not fun at all. 
one reason we should try to go is only becuase of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because humans curisoity will likely lead us into many eqaully intimdating endeavors 
Even though the driverless car could reduce the amount of harmful checmicals in the air it could increase the amount of radiation exposed to humans and other living things. 
The first reason is many people are still ignoring the Law because the charges are very low, if they get caught the insurance rates are nit going to hike much for them 
There was a face on mars, 
most driveless cars are still a work in progress and may still take years to perfect. More than just sensors have to be added to make it fully driveless meaning no driver assistance, no alerts, no seat vibrations, and no laser beams. Car companies have to make sure that the cars are safe enough to be on the roads before they release it to the public. Safety features such as the "heads-up displays" and more would have to be added to ensure the safety of the passengers. 
My first reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships. 
An operating system or machine cannot become tired, frustrated, emotional, angry, or distracted in any way; its judgement is mechanical, and there are no variables of human unpredictability. Most if not all vehicular accidents are caused by some sort of human error in judgement, and driverless cars eliminate this possibility, which is conducive to a much safer driving environment. 
Giving student guidelines are very helpful in getting the project done. 
Although you are considering the policy to chance, keeping the policy to allow any student participate in sports and other activities will permit them with chances of a better, well-rounded future. Think of the students futures above what they learn today and may not excel in. 
Obama recived 6.1 percent from the electoral vote and 51.3 percent for the poplar votes. It was an uncertain vote because the college don't know what the people would pick as a result. but many people think that it should be like that because they are voting for a slate of elector and not for president.(sourse 2) 
Not every one gets to vote. 
despite being hard for them to try and study Venus. The authors suggetion on the story is very help full i can see why some peolpe would like to keep on going with there owm this time. even though people might not want to look any closser to Venus i belive it would be alot helpfull if we learn alot more of what is out there in space. 
According to paragraph 4 it states "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."(TCOEV), Which fueled the minds of the scientists , because they just wanna know what was on the surface of venus. 
Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hard working lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones. 
In sourse 3, number 22 (There is no pressure for run-offelections when no candidatewins a a majorityof the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invarable produces a clear winner...) Simply this says that without the electoral college voting can be difficult and stressful. 
the posablet of a tie. 
students will not get on 
With the elimination of a multitude of distractions found in public schools, students will find it easier to use the tools and technology given to them to aid their educational path. 
What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters. 
I feel the elctoral college is overpowered and isnt neccsary 
its not because of our grades that makes you so upset its because of our attitudes and how we act around teachers and staff specially officer baker i mean the man has been though to much already 
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
Around April 5 in 1998 Mars global flew over Cydonia for the first time and took a better picture of the icon for we can tell what 
Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon. 
Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? 
: If you take classes from home you can learn but if you take the classes direcly from some school thatone is the best way that you to learn. 
If these projects were to have free choice for the student to talk about, research, or report on anything they want, it would most likely end up with the school having a bigger abundance of students doing their summer projects 
Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be cosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that recieve more atention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed. 
being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has 
When i vote i like to know as soon as possible and i feel as if we had popular vote it would be faster to do. Opinoins may not be taken inconcideration but my opinion is strong that we should use popular vote i really feel like more people would come to vote if we used that. People may feel like the Electoarl College is too long of a process so they just say oh i dont have to go vote so im not going to. The Electoral College avoids elections but without them how would we know about our future president and how would we know whether or not the person would do a good job at running our country? 
some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. 
its equal. 
So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things. 
yes there should because our school is not clean and a lot of students leave there trash and they blame other people. For some other people trash . That's not right that they do that so defenetly . 
This is what I think the outher group wants to achive. You have read what i thought on this subject and i hope to bring you over to my side on this argument. There is curuption every were and we need to stick together, if we dont then who can we trust 
People all around the world go through different things, but it's those who are there with you that help guide the way 
The Electoral College system is old news and now that we are in 2015 there are all sorts of new things going on. The Electoral College system is just too much and seems like a hassle that can be made easier by having qualified citizens vote for their President. 
Reading in the articleIn Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President they point out the "when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors....but each part selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the part's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) 
Imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requried to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in the Congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Taxas, fpr instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democatic electors pludges to Mr. Kerry. 
In the text Luke said "It opened the world to him."The text states that he was grateful for the oppotunity. 
When it comes down to it the aurthor as you can tell heavily supports the thought of traveling to Venus. 
the person who gets the most ammount of votes gets to be the president. Thats as simple as it can get. And in my opinion, it is as fair as it gets. 
Ultimately, participating in extracurricular activities is a very beneficial from a young age. These activities can boost confidence, teach people how to work together, and improve time management skills. So, next time you have the opportunity to try a new sport or activity, go for it! You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Suggest clubs and activities to friends and family members. It is important to involve not only yourself, but others too. Remember Tim, the professional bird watcher? If he had never took the risk of participating in the bird watching club at his school, he would never have been discovered his true passion of bird watching. Maybe one day you will be like Tim and participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know... it could shape your future for the better. 
I am involved in dance and it has really helped me become a more diverse person. 
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. Should these projects be student or teacher choice? Are the students able to create their own? Students summer break is their time ,so why not let them keep it that way? 
Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important rolein the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. 
when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others 
You're not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly" 
It is understading citizens in the South might feel like their vote does not count, 
Do something good for school is good because when they gave you advice to do the right thing is class. For example the gym teacher gave you advice to do the right not the bad advice because if you do the bad thing you will get a bad grade and get in trouble. When we get in trouble is bad and you always have to listen when they gave us advice for you do well at your test. When we do well in our test is because the teacher was having us advice and we were paying attecion. 
They'll become happier and less stressed out from other things going on, like problems with family or schoolwork, which will have a positive affect on their grades, family life, and social life. This, can lead to even more success in the future. Lastly, they can create lifelong friends, and meet more people which can help them get how used to introducing themselves to other people, and get used to the situation. This is another important skill for the future that is taught by an extracurricular. 
The cars may never truly be driveless, technology cannot do everything humans do. There is always going to be times an actual driver may need to come in. Things such as, traffic or crashes or roadwork and there is no way of telling if driverless cars may be able to adapt to that. Not only is adapting a problem but is our technology advanced enough to have driverless cars? We as a society are advanced in the technology area but is it advanced enough to develop cars that are able to know where to go or what to do just like humans are? Technology things do not think like humans, they don't think at all, they have to be programed a certain way and there is always surprises or certain situations that these cars would not be able to do it properly or safely. 
Paris, France has the most smog out of all the other European capitals. They had "147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, Reuters found." After days of heavy pollution. A partial driving ban was enforced to clear the city's air. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home. If they didn't do so, they would be charged with a 22-euro fine. The same order wouls be given to odd-numbered plates the next day. Almost 4,000 driver's cars were fined for using their cars.In Bogota, Colombia they set up a program, The day without cars it's when cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman. The day without cars is part of an improvment campaign that began in bogota in the mid-1990's. during this year's anual day without cars, authorities from others countries have can to see the event and were very pleased by it. " These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders" said by Enrique Riera, the major of Asunci`on, Paraguay.In recent studies it's shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, getting less lincenses, and driving less as each year goes by. Many beleive America's love for cars is deteriorating. The number of miles driven has gone down since 2005. Some think it's because we simpliy can't afford new cars."A study last year found driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009" Even the number of cars per home has gone down. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn" said by Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. If this patterns persists it will be very benificial to the environment. Mimi Sheller, a sociology professer at Drexel University thinks the internet makes people feel more connected, therefore we don't feel the need to drive out and meet friends. 
You could try to blame the manufacture however you're probably not going to get to far. It's not their fault the computer of the car had a glitch. There is nothing they can do about it. So now you could potentally be charged with wreckless driving and vehicular manslotter, even though you didn't intentually kill the person. Your insurance is most likely going to say it was your fault for not having controll of the car. Who is to say it was infact the car and not your fault? That's just the problem exactaly . 
There are pleny of advantages fellow citizens get for having limited car usage. 
However, schools often implement strict regulations on phones, food, and talking as they know how much these things can be a distraction to a learning environment. 
Two maybe some students just don't want to do extra stuff for school maybe after a long day at school they just wanna go home and relax or watch TV. 
Students would have more motivation if their summer projects were designed by themselves. 
However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded. Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project. They will start the year off poorly. The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it. 
Although this software may serve as an effective source of profit for online corporations, it has no valueable place in classrooms. 
The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that larges states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. 
Luke Bomberger used to be an average teenager working two part-time jobs. Then his friend, Don Reist, came and asked him if he wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.   
most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. 
I think we should have a club in doing so for many reasons. 
When being are more active throughout the day, occurences such as this are allowed to happen much more often 
This would mean you would have a large variety of choices to pick from. 
If it was man made this would not have happend they would have kept it clean. 
Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not.  As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in "What Is the Electoral College".  In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all.  Those candidates went mainly to the "swing" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for.  The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what.  The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state.  In, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", the Romney and Obama election is mentioned.  It brings up the fact that Romney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote.  He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes.  Those who opposed Romney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for Romney.  If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in. 
With this advanced technology students will just keep changing if there smiling, if their mad, sad, glad, etc. and checking if the technology can actually do its job. 
I can honestly say it a cause for people to lose their life because I've been involved. My grandmother was talking on the phone it was a self-hand just to end and answer the phone that lil second caused an accident she hit someone from the back don't never think you have the sense to avoid an accident well you don't.   
To begin with the FACS computer, it's seeming to be useful because if a student is being confused during a lesson and the teacher can be notified and the problem can be resolved. 
Another reason driverless cars should continue to be manufactered is that they will be more efficient and better protect the enviroment 
Now lets say If you can not go to school if you have let's say the corona virus, you can just have classes there in bed,on a couch,or the kitchen table just like you would be at school. 
but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects. 
People ask for advice and feedback almost everyday. It could be advice regarding fashion, education, or artistic feedback. For example, imagine a student finishing a project she's been working on for quite awhile. Before turning the assignment in, this student will most likely ask her peers for their opinions on it. However, notice how she won't ask one single person, rather multiple people for feedback. 
So we come here to discuss a topic. A very intresting one if you say. This topic has history to it and some people don't like this topic. Some people don't like this topic because of the way it works. This thing i'm talking about is the Electoral College. 
And i think that no humans were even exsistent by the time that monument happened. 
beacuse it keeps people from directly voting for a presdient 
This is a major turn for the worse because students are taking advantage of this and aren't learning anything new for themselves, which is creating more volatile and unintelligent individuals. A historical example that relates more to the way the schooling was before this was the Brown v. Board of Education case. Although, this was a terrible time of segregated schools it was the Brown family who took independence when no one would stand with them and they took the fight to the Supreme Court for their well deserved equality and civil right. However, it would be another grueling, sad 20 years until this was accomplished it can be believed that the way the curriculum was taught related to the way this family was courageous enough to complete this task. 
Everyday there's always someone whose severely injured or either worst end up dead because of the use of using their phone while operating a vehicle of any kind. 
The face on Mars is a landform 
Often times struggling students or children who "hate" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career. These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them. If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn. When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day. It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects. 
Its like when you look at someone and see that they are sad or happy. It can detect an espression like that. "Now imagine a computer that knows when your having trouble." 
How would they survive and humans can not. In paragraph nine it discribes how hard it was to even get a picture of this face. If its very hard to get a good glimpse of this image. Its going to be struggle to live and be active on Mars as well. This has to be a natural landform that happens to looks like a face. If someone really did this, they would want credit and all the fame for all their hard work and i think we would have spotted them all ready. 
because some kids may have more pressure to help out at home 
But even know some don't want the electoral college there are some who prefer to keep it. 
If the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of America chose. 
The ones who use it after school for rides home or talk to their friends. It just depends on the school and the students. 
Chossing our President so be done by popular vote and the electoral college. This will allow citizens who are involed with the congress and who are not involeve to have equal say on who is president. 
What if the car doesnt stop at the lights and it causes an accident? 
First of all, we voted for the candiate not for the electoral. We don't know the electoral. Knowing this, we the citizens just might not vote anymore. The electoral is not sharing the presidential house, we choose one person to look up too. Not the greedy electoral. Some states don't even vote anymore because they know that there vote has no effect 
Never know what can happen you might pass a red light and cause an accident. Phones shouldn't be use for texting nor calling but you can use it to get somewhere. In case you don't know where it is you can use your gps but that's it. 
Being assingned president of the united states is a very big deal, especially to the millions of people that live in this god blessed country.herThe united states of america has had different presidents ever since the beginning of this country. These presidents are not in it for the money, but they are holding the title"president"because these people want what is right for this country. But, how do we pick who gets to be president? It all comes down to the electoral college. Citizens of the united states are allowed to vote at the age of 18, these votes are said to mean so much, but that isnt always the case. It really all comes down to the number of electoral votes. Why make all these citizens vote, when the outcome might not even follow along with these votes. 
First,Professor. Thomas Huang of the beckman Institute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois working withProfessor. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate which the proces begin when a computer constructs a 3-D computer Model of the Human face that contains all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like Human. 
The FACS is extermely helpful and useful is because the FACS materials can be expressive for video games or video surgery. It can also help with human communication that aew nonverbal including emotional communtication. By according to Dr. Huang notes he says " So computers need to understand that too.".Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile. To support my claim is in pargraph 7 it says " Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. " But you can write down some simple instructions that "encode" the different emotions. 
In paragraph 8, it says that, " The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings we hidden by haze." Conspiracy theorists also state that NASA would rather hide the evidence that there is an ancient civilization on Mars, as it says in paragraph 5. 
School is one part of student's lives and some only have a limited amount of time they can put towards that one part. Many people struggle with family matters and are not always left out of them because they attend school. A student might be going to school everyday and as soon as they get home, they are taking care of another member in their family or cooking and cleaning. Many kids run their households because their parents are not in the right condition to act their part. This leads to students working and schooling. All those things take up a big portion of time and can cause much stress on the individual. Also, many times, students just fall ill out of nowhere, and are in such conditions where they have to stay home and rest. Having access to classes online and available to them at any given time reduces much burdens off their shoulders. No one really knows what goes on in student's lives outside of school, so the opportunity to attend classes should be permitted. 
so there should be some sort of points system where you have to have a certain amount of points to get the privilege of phones 
Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing." 
With the information the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" covers, this advancement in technology seems extremely unnecessary and could potentially have negative effects even with the good intentions behind it. 
but what about the others. 
If you are generally a shy person then a club or sports team will help you meet new people. For instance, if you get on a sports team you and your team will become one big family. You all will work together during games which will create a bond. Another example is if you join an art club you will have something to talk about because you both will like art. Sometimes it can be hard to open up to people and make friends but trust me doing an activity will help that tremendously. When I first joined JV soccer I was really intimidated by all the big kids, but then I talked to them and they seemed really nice and talked to me. This goes to show that extracurricular activities can help you make friends that you would of never made if you didn't join that club. 
it's unfair to a candidate that wins the popular vote but loss the election 
Also its outside the box not every car can be driverless but some can. Just look a lamborghini or ferrari they dont have as much technology as some of the newer middle class cars do.But your paying $500,000 for some thing that doesnt have as many features as a prius or a smart car. But also driverless cars arent really driveless if some has to take the wheel and go around some things that means the cars not really driveless 
but the parent may have to go to work or run errands throughout the day, which would create a loophole for the students to have access to the various electronics in the house. 
I don't think you want that though 
Venus should not be considered dangerous. 
The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. 
So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.        
that will work to he mite do it and he mite not any way you tried to get him to change his mind 
An autonomous car would be safer than a human driven car because a computer program cannot be distracted by its passengers or get angry at someone's poor driving because a computer doesn't think emotionally, but rather logically, making the computer driver safer. Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes. 
It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. 
While writing on what would be necessary for travel and observation of Venus, the author states "a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions...[and be] survivable for humans.However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions...[Also,] standard forms of photography...[would be] innefective...Therefore, sciendtists seeking to...understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"(5).By stating that "a vehicle hovering over Venus" would be safe for humans and then directly stating that it would not be enough and that scientists who want useful information would have to "get up close and personal despite the risks", the author states conflicting ideas.In addition, earlier in the passage the author states "On the planet's surgace, temperatures average over 800 degrees"(3).This creates another serious flaw in the author's idea, because the conditions stated are not even close to survivable. 
Something as simple as helping a senior citizen cross the street would make a HUGE difference. Planting a tree would give more oxygen to the air and fertilize the soil with its nutrients. doing any little good deed would help the environment and the community around it. 
I disagree with them because the senators have a say in who is going to win the election and be president all at the end,so why worry. 
I think we should not have the electoral college. Mostly because i dont think i want to learn about swing states and run off elections and stuff. 
This is why many might prefer attending school instead of attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Many students might or might not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. But many students don't have a choice because many schools now offer distance learning for students around the world. Students from New York schools now have to attend online classes because of the Corona Virus,this caused a big impact on students who learn better in front of a teachers not through a computer or online conferencing.   
There's a few reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible 
and even how unfair it is to our countries voters. 
I think they should be able to bring their phones just turn them off because there so many reason why they need their phone. 
Students can benefit by taking online classes or by video conference 
In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms for students. They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. It will help students and teachers understand eachother better. Overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all. 
All students should want to help others but the reality is not all care as much as others. 
I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term 
It's part of the list of rights the people should have. Any one can be a elector. In the past, an elector has change there candiate. so instead of who a person's vote going to who they voted for... it would go to the other candidate. Not everything hat should be right in this world is. 
Many students with illnesses such as Lyme disease are forced to skip class due to their illness. If too many days are missed, the student can fall behind in class and many be forced to repeat a class or an entire year. This causes an unneeded burden on the student, the family, and the school system. The aforesaid parties would greatly benefit from a remote learning system as the chronically ill student would be able to keep pace with the class from home. This reduces the probability that the student fails the class and is forced to repeat it. By making lectures available online, these students, and all students for that matter, would be given the chance to earn a higher grade as working outside of the class is more efficient. Students who want to study for an exam can go back through old lectures to ensure that they know all of the important information presented in class. This would result in higher grades, fewer failing students, and a better chance of success in college and later in life. 
i think we should be able to have phones during lunch and any free time we get. 
In the more populated citys, people are using more bikes and less cars. Its easier to get around a city where there are thousands of people on the streets alone. 
Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens. 
there are people out here that are in need bad but your going to Greece just too help other people. It's a good idea but just think about what you good do here. I'm one of those people who love helping others but I know that I could just help someone here because going to Greece!! I wouldin't want too because I already have more than enuogh people I could help, things I could see, things I could do. There is just so much to do, and to see. I know that if you just think there will be something to do for our community just like that. Like I said you don't need to got to Greece to see that! 
Students get fall in environment learning. 
There could be life under the ground but we wouldn't know that cause we cant even get to the surface of the plant. If there is life on the plant we could learn how they world by watching. Maybe even with pictures. With oceans we could find if there are organisms in it. It would prove that there is a different kind of life on the planet. 
However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn 
By doing distance learning you as a student will not get to handle hands on stuff or go with then anywhere they go. 
These learning environments surround students by other peers and encourage debates, understandings, and protests. The benefits may seem negative, but in these events students start to bounce ideas off of each other and grow in thought processing. Students will attract those who agree with their views and form bonds, creating comfort in the classroom for them. It is easy to feel alone when you don't understand a topic, but it can be valuable to have that other person there in the class who doesn't quite get the same problem you don't. You can collaborate, put together what you both know, and come up with a solution. this not only provides for better learning, but provides children with the social skills they will need for life. 
I hope i have made my point across about the Electoral college system. 
Personally I believe that Electoral Colleges work 
The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results.  One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal.  
you will also find time to have fun,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The UNRRA hired us seagoing cowboy to take care of horses,young cows,and mules. 
during the break the bad students be doing sexual things and having a nice time during the break and to the students that are mostly to do the project will be disapointed on how they failed the project 
Individuals that vote on their electors can not always control who their electors choose for president. 
because its better for u then school . 
The main con is that the machine may take time to read a face and by the time it has been read, the emotion can change. Also, this technology can be expensive, especially for a school with hundreds or even thousands of students 
Education is one of the fundamental pillars of a successful democracy and harmonious society. As such, it is of the utmost importance that America's education system be of the highest quality in order to foster the development of intelligent citizens. With the rapid advancement of new technology has come opportunities for new ways to learn; students can type rather than hand write, access internet databases for information, and work collaboratively online rather than in person, among other advantages. It is easy to believe that all the aspects of technology that have been introduced to schools have positively impacted student performances, but an outlier is online learning. 
People seek multiple opinions for many reasons. The ones I mentioned where ones I find important to most people. 
Also the principle should help them see how hard is for other people to live so they will relice that they are lucky have parent or to go to school because there are people who do not have anything. 
Finally, I think student should not be takink online classes because it going to help them to have a differet view on what there doing 
How can a facial action coding system can identify a persons initial facial exspretion? Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases 
Venus was once covered with oceans and could have had life. Venus still has some features that are similar to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment, and has similar features such as, valleys, mountains , and craters. 
Online schooling would certainly work best for some students, but it would be more detrimental for the learning of others due to the diversity in the ways in which we learn. 
Driving is a privelege and I enjoy it.I don't understand why we would want to take this away. 
The schools should have a Recycling competition where the Study hall class that brings in the most items to be recycled, 
The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. 
Summer is mean't for fun and laughter, not being kept inside all day working on a project the teacher assigned over summer break. The whole point of summer is being away from school and having a vacation. So wouldn't students prefer to do a project about something that they are passionate about? Indeed, studies show that when students do school work that they choose and are passionate about their work ends up being more creative and overall better performance. Students are just growing up and in school they aren't allowed to truly express themselves because they are either too shy or the class doesn't discuss their interests. Teenagers only want to do and listen to what they want, they don't want a teacher giving them homework over summer break not even to mention that it is not something they enjoy. 
Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a women who needed Obamacare for her ill son, yet she was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam. 
When someone seeks advice, they should ask multiple people because it ensures them that their choice will be least biased. People should avoid bias because some opinions may not benefit them and may only benefit the person who is giving the piece of advice. When people ask for advice, each person they ask most likely has a different opinion. When all these opinions are considered, the chance of bias is reduced. When someone takes their own advice, they may have a slight inclination to go for what they want to do, and they may not consider all options. For example, I have a decision to make of whether or not I want to move for my father's work to Generic_City. I only considered my own preferences for a while, and I automatically said that I didn't want to go. I refused to leave my friends, my school, my routine, and everything else that makes my life splendid here. When I finally decided to hear what my parents had to say, my choice became less biased. My parents helped me see the benefits of moving, which I had not thought about because I didn't want to think that I would enjoy moving. In addition they helped me see it in their point of view, which leads to the next point. 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
The beauty of the human nature is to be able to adapt, adapt through hardships, adapt to new changes. Take chances in life, be prosperous, because at the end of the day, you only get one. 
The Electoral College is hurting our county because we are not getting the accurate votes we think we're getting. Citizens are not going to want to vote anymore because of how unfair these campaigns are. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an election. 
even though there are many many disavantages and mistakes about the Electoral College there are a few advantages. Like it takes less time for the congress to vote. 
Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. 
The electoral college is also unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system. 
First, extracurricular activity can bring students to learn new things about that specific activity and even the things they learned will help them in real life in the near future 
You can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming. This is why this is just a landmark. There is a lot of landmarks on earth and this is one of them on Mars. There is no evidence of any of this so don't believe what everybody says.              
communication skills 
That is one of the reasons why you should seek multiple opinions when making a choice. This is very important if you want to make the best decision. If you don't seek other opinions, you'll only consider your point of view. Your point of view may not always be the best point of view. 
Then on April 8,2001 on a summer day and no clouds,Mars Global Surveyor was close enough for a second look. With the teams camera they captured an extraortdinary photo. With this picture you can blow it up three times bigger to see what it really is 
I think that its a good idae to send more probes to venus even despite the cost. i am totally on bourd with this. 
With the Electoral College, there is also the risk that electors may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president. 
Teachers can't trust that all students are like that though because each kid is different and most likely, when given the chance, the student will take the day to go to the pool rather than sit at home and do their own research about Stem Cell research. 
Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. 
it helps them feel more motivated, 
theres also some things thats wrong with the electoral college...1 : is that under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors, 
when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class 
Then in paraagrph 7 the author said NASA is coming up with a machine made of silicon carbide to work on Venus's surface. It has been tested. 
It decreases the time to finish work at home rather than at school. Most online school programs offer as much time as you need on an assignment. Although, once you've started one there is of course, a deadline. Attending online school at home is very benefitial in this reason because it would make it easier for the student. On that note, if a student were to be having trouble with an assignment online they would be able to turn it in once they have understood it completely or if not the student could move on to another subject and come back to it. That is what makes online school at home very helpful and beneficial. In a classroom that would not be possible, in some cases, they would have no other choice but to turn it when needed to and accept the consequences. 
The electoral college method  may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The fact that they feel their vote has no effect, they pay less attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
People who think that they should not convince ohers to join is because they think that they would be away from their family's for a long period of time. And it's a lot of hard work. 
I believe that this job should be given to litter bugs. That have been doing the littering. Yea every once in a while if u see a piece of trash pick it up, butt to be forced is not the correct thing to do to students. We the students did not do any thing to be punished . 
for example "if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. "Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, "and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." 
Many states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. 
" The winner- take-all methode of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states." 
Whenever you feel as if you need to ask a question go ahead and ask the question because there is never a bad question to ask because you might be on the verge of creating something new and just don't know it yet. 
With this being said, I believe I have made my impact on your thoughts of the question, " to keep the Electoral College, or change election to popular vote?". The Electoral College has both it's upsides and it's downside, but I believe it has more flaws than perfections. Yes, it has been around for many decades and is apart of our histroy, maybe it worked then, but it's not working now. And we need to make a change before things get worse. 
In paragraph 3 they talk about how Venus is earthlike. Some examples are that Venus has oceans, valcanoes, lighting strikes, earthquaks and much more. 
Students should be required to participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council 
there are many other reasons one might want to seek multiple opinions and pieces of advice instead of just one, but these are the two main ones that I think really make it worthwhile to ask for advice from multiple people instead of making decisions with only one piece of advice from one person. The key thing that all of these examples have shown is that it is better to seek multiple opinions from multiple different people than to only get advice from one. This is ultimately because asking multiple people for advice makes you feel better about the decisions you make and also increases the chances that one or more of the people you consulted with gave you the right advice at the right time to empower you do what is right for you (or perhaps what is right for the country you happen to be in charge of!).                                                                              
The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone. 
The electors want to cast in more votes from big states other than small states. 
Venus could be suitable for humans 
I think that having the school do community service is a great idea! 
His next topic was about how we have already sent space crafts over to Venus. All of them, however, were unmanned 
Another reason this would be a better option for students, is so that one would be able to plan out their day and fulfill responsibilities. This might be work, taking care of siblings, or parents, and so on. But, it might also include other activities, like sports, music, travel, etc. Online schooling would be convenient for those with different lifestyles. In conclusion, all of these things would be made possible while allowing a student to receive adequate education. 
ubs and sports are very social activities. If they're in a club, students are basically required to socialize with others. This for the most part is a very positive benefit, allowing students to talk to others who share similar interests with them. Students may even spend time outside the clubs with the people they've met. For example, my cousin Generic_Name's mom, forced Generic_Name to join a club. She said Generic_Name wasn't socializing enough and spent to much time time on his computer. Generic_Name asked around to find a club that was preferably easy. He eventually found the computer club which aligned with his interests, and his want to spite my aunt by "playing on computers" in his club. Despite that my aunt got her wish and Generic_Name became more social outside of school with his new club.Generic_Name had spent his entire 10th grade year in the gaming club. Now that summer was approaching for the first time in his life he felt sad about leaving during the summer. Generic_Name never thought by joining a club his perception about school would change this drastically. The next day Generic_Name and his club talked about meeting up over the summer, everyone was ecstatic about the idea. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name all have met up before outside of the club before, but the entire club has never got together like this. School ended just as fast as it started and the day quickly approached when the club would get back together again. 
Have you ever believed something that wasn't true? I have, but before you believe it you have to find out if it's true or not. In the article it says the "face" looks like it could have been a Martian mesa. Also the shadows and the lighting could be making it look more like a face. There for if the NASA wanted to go there to get evidence it would cost them a huge budget. 
Students are going to be put under a lot of pressure if they have to keep up with school work and take school activities which could cause stress. Also students sometimes won't be able to keep up with all the work and activities after school. 
Let us be able to take our phones and use them! We won't want to get our freedom from them, so we won't text in class. If some people get caught, then they should get their's. 
This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students. 
Although walking, jogging, or riding a bicycle isnt must safer than riding in a vehicle.  
Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home. In my opinion there will be some students that will take this serious and do the right thing.                                                                                                                                                           
All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent. 
Everyday, in the world people are corrupted by the following: losing their jobs, a natural disaster may put them out of their homes, and even just a problem with finances. When some of those people lost everything, they literally lost ever thing except for maybe the clothes on their back and the pride that may have been shattered 
can even help you decide for yourself. 
Third, It has been going good so far. 
Many people in political carrers question why not many people vote in the United States Of America. 
I injoy driving and going in and out of plces. 
They say Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead into intimidating endeavors. They also say that even though there are dangers here that means that we shouldn't stop what we are doing we keep pushing. They also say beacuse of doubts they shouldn't give up. If a spacecraft can't stay there for more than two hours then how do you explore it with out having risks. This could put people in dnager. 
He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's "twin". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" states, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it. 
If you have a problem ask! if you need advice on something ask 3-5 people for there opinion that way you get multiple sources telling you things that may help you make a better choice 
Finnaly,the last reason i think that we should not have that Electoral College is because it dont doing the people anything if we take it away 
It would make you aware of people and people of there other contries and there needs. It might evan lead you closer to makeing something good in this world. It led Luke Bombergers family to do amazing things like hosta number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. 
Your understanding can save all the memories and also can help you in your work or things that you have to do for the improvement,you don't have to do other thing that we don't need,because we only wan't that the government can tell us that we can trust in you and with ours help everybody have the hope in you that the futura that is coming is better than this.For be honest I wan't to know you for put in order the points that each other have to know and share for the welfare of the state,basically we only have to explain what thing is wrong 
Students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested and may not have a means of transportation. A student may also have trouble balancing out extracurricular work and school work. Though at the end of the day, everyone has his or her own purpose in life. It may be to do big things or some may want to do small things. It is not fair to be forced to do something that an individual may not want to do. Students have the right to choose their own path in life and to express themselves as they please.         
All in all, summer projects should be student-designed. 
You can make an enouncement with their parents telling the parents about the community service 
NASA, could just be saying this to get attention, but mabey not. Even if there was alein landform on mars, we will not be able to know for sure 
but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. 
The only reason that people get bored in school is because they don't think that they are helping there future in school because they don't feel involved. But if they are required to do community service they would feel involved and it would help there future. 
This will be able to help people know that if we do are work together as a group we will accomplish more work 
some kids have other things to do 
Allowing students to design their own summer project allows them to work at their own pace. 
It would help kids stay out of trouble, 
its not working out like that at all. it's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it all mostly assertions in without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! 
One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. 
Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do. Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do. 
Another reason would be to learn how to handle things outside home and school, but also learn how to handle things at home and in school. 
There are many resaons so why I think that FACS should have not been invented to figure out the emotions of pictures or humans 
Distance learning is a new tool that some schools are using in order to give students an option of taking a class at home instead of at the classroom. This is an interesting way of teaching because it provides the comfort of working at home for students, which is becoming an increasing trend as of 2019, while still providing high-quality education from professional educators. 
When an emergency happens, Students can call their parents or call for help when they are instructed to do so.Calling their parents can let them know that they are all safe from a natural disaster. Either it is a flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. Students letting their parents know that they are fine shows the responsibility they carry.Calling parents after school can let them know what time their child gets out of school. When not having a cell phone, certain students have to use the phones in class and/or the ones in the office. If so, they may or may not be able to get out of school on time. Parents always have to make sure they leave on time to know what happens at school and after school.Having parents to know that their child is doing good in school means that their parents are happy that their child had a grea 
Summer time is exciting but when it comes to a end it can be upsetting. Feeling prepared for the year to come and all the work along with it could really help one in feeling less nervous, scared, and discouraged. Teachers need to design projects over the summer so students feel excited and ready for school to begin rather than to feel disapointed and unprepared.   
As of now driverless cars seem to be more trouble than help.With time I feel that they could become very safe and reliable vehicles with advancements in technology.There are many manufacturers trying to make driverless cars, at least one of them is bound to make something good eventually.In conclusion, I think driverless cars should keep being developed, however they still need a lot of work.           
lets one know what the most reliable choices are based on how many have suggested them 
NASA need to do more resurch on Venuse but it is hard to do when Venuse has only been bored a few times and its hard to see through a scope. 
Then on how the author likes the ideas that NASA is coming up with to visit earth with what he/she said was a "compelling idea" and the machines and devices that their making that the author likes as well 
Besides talking to your teen regularly about this issue and setting a good example by not using your cell phone while driving yourself, there are other simple ways to monitor your teen's phone use while they're behind the wheel. Start by activating smartphone features that help prohibit texting while driving. We need to take advantage of technology, utilizing apps that allow you as the parent more transparency into your child's whereabouts and driving habits. 
The last reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because of the disaster factor. 
Yet, the word 'rarely' still sticks, and not many can just simply deny that it is not there. The rest of the statment in paragraph 16 continues onto lines 4-6, "[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote." So in simple terms, you can get the electoral vote which can put you ahead, but you won't win with just that under your belt. The people still matter, and their vote can still count against you. 
In the story the author talked abouth how Venus is despite in danger. 
First of all, it is worth considering that phones shouldn't be allowed on peoples hands while driving 
Understandably, these points are legitimate, for the student could easily choose not to join the online conference to their class, for no teacher could force them to go to their next class. 
because they will be intertain. 
you learn different perspectives, 
For instance, students who need clarification of certain material may not receive an adequate explanation online because their teacher's attention may be divided or focused on some other task. Additionally, in person, students would be able to ask follow-up questions and have a thorough discussion with their teacher, whereas a messaging system might not allow for steady communication due to breaks between answers. Therefore, there may be gaps in students' learning, which could contribute to poor performance in their classes. 
The article is about venuse that some time called be the Evening star. 
At first, this face is just a natural landform 
I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do 
To keep the Electoral College or to change the election by popular vote is the question many people are facing today. There are many different reason why we should keep, and same for as why we should change it. 
Another reason why i think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activitys is that most students are already stressed out with homework and studying outside of school 
Everyone's President 
they would make the world a more productive place 
Some may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial, 
Drivers must take control of their vehicles when "pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents," (Driveless Cars Are Coming). Some driverless cars are not even able to drive themselves unless under very specific conditions, such as specially made roads that are designed specifically so that the car may navigate itself. Although the driverless cars are supposed to "mimic the skill of a human at the wheel," (Driverless Cars Are Coming), there are many situations, some already listed, that they are unable to do what humans do. 
I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. 
"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." 
We all need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program! 
If the person researches and ends up compiling a ton of inaccurate information, that won't help them at all. This is very likely as many sources online can be inaccurate. Although 
The electoral college is well known and has always been the way to pick our president. its a non-democratic method of selectiing the president 
if they decide the topic they will complete it 
Second reason, i think it fair if we use our phones cause i bet all school in this world teacher use their phone that is a other reason. 
Luke is likes the program good all its good things. So i whould go and other people shuld to. 
First, this solution addresses the wants of the first group. 
You should as different people only f they gone trough and they have experience with it. 
Computers don't need to understand what humans feel because they don't have feelings. 
Even though the hands free law can help with the risk of car accidents and keep people off their phones while driving, studies have shown that wether your texting by voice or looking at your phone the risk of crashing is the same. The hands free law should not be in play.  
so you want to take all the cars out of the city ok cool 
more then one opinion is always going to be better then just one. 
. On the downside, there will be a few students who will not want to work to get the B average and they will not participate in sports or other activities. 
Students should not be required to perform community service in order to pass a class or grade. Community service should not be a requirement, 
Friends are an ideal part of everyone's lives and online course do not provide that, but schools do. My friend, who i just recently met and has been home schooled his whole life until his senior year, found it hard to have friends because he did not know anybody. He is a shy person and does not like interacting with any out-going activities because he did not know how to engage with other people. Because of this, people who go to public schools at a young age are more likely to make friends there and have even more friends the more they grow up and as they enter high school. All in all, online courses do not provide people like friends that are a key part of our lives and help us build our character and self-esteem about each other. 
But i also see that from where you stand the Electral Collage may be just a waste of money and in some peoples eyes it is. 
This means that even though it's dangerouse to go to Venus, we shouldn't help us hold it back, space is a very dangerous place, and if we let us hold us back, we won't get anywhere, and Fast. 
Students can take notes, do homework, and take tests online. Students will make sure they do their work and send it to their teachers online. 
So i believe that our school should take a full day off, out side, help other people clean up streets, parks, and yards. It would be a lot of help, and even if we don't get paid, we all know we did the right thing. Our world could be a much better place than what it is now. 
Choosing weather we should keep the electorial college or start voting by popular vote well some may say its a tough choice and others may say that its an easy one. But after awhile and you take some time to think about it, you come to your sences and see that well maybe it is a simple question. The question is does the electorial college work? 
Teenagers lack of motivation would lead to the unproductive reality of online school. 
i think that this group thinks this because they know how to get around the system or play it. Doing so makes it easy'er for them to have someone that they trust or control on the top of the game 
It's safe to say Venus isn't human friendly. Venus isn't human friendly because of the; boiling heat, the carbon dioxide, and the intense natural disasters.Venus doesn't seem robot friendly either due to when a probe gets close it'll stike the probe with lightning. As if these are warning signs Venus clearly doesn't want any visitors anytime soon it's best to stay on Earth for now. Venus is uninhabitable for now at least you'll never know what the future may bring. 
in Generic_City schools they have to take every class every year and some extra load on the top. But expert for one thing it was summer school project, because they want their student to relay on their self not on the others. Sometime when you do the work on your own, you known how hard is the work and you will more learn by the work you did in the end. 
If you were to vote for your favorite tv show but your vote had to go through twenty different people all with different opinions you would be frustrated. Now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than a televison show, the president. You are trusting possibly the next four years of your life with strangers in which you have never heard of before. It would only be fair if we could simply change the system to popular vote rather than electoral college. 
And its not like the people are not choosing their president. The electoral college still go's with the peoples vote they just go in more depth with choosing the right president. 
Wether it is students struggling with mental and physical health problems or just average students. The flexibility and accessability of online schooling can make getting an education not as difficult as it needs to be 
Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced. These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand. But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus. 
It is necessary for a student to keep their mind active over long breaks from school, such as summer break.Some may say that assigning a teacher designed project is the way to go 
I think cars should still be famous in the future so we could make new cars. 
Also, a further benefit of asking for outside help, is for the well-being of others. If this decision could affect the lives of other individuals, its only common sense to be one hundred and one percent sure before making that decision, and what better way to be one hundred and one percent sure than asking the advice of others. 
I am againt the development of driverless cars. 
When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice. 
This system is really useful in my opinion, because you can recognize all emotions someone is feeling. 
People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. 
But, immersing them in an environment that encourages social interaction would be a more ideal situation as they would be able to learn how to overcome their anxiety; there are more effective, and less drastic measures that can be taken to help a student with social anxiety as opposed to taking them out of the classroom setting altogether and replacing them with online settings. 
the artecal shows you how people can make nothing into something even if they fail they still can gt something else right or make something even though they tried to do something else.    
the people can't know for sure who chose the electors. Anyone could have chosen them! 
There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-democrats in Texas, for example,or Republicans in California. Each party selects a slate os electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an person or thing in the past that cannot fit in the present. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.                                                                                   
Students would benefit from being able to take classes from home 
One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. 
Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology. 
because having a face to face teaching can really help students understand better, 
Venuse is known as the "Evening Stars because it is just a dot in the lends. 
I cant imagine how crazy my life would be if i had to practice sports every night, practice my musical instrument, and still find time in a week to do community service projects. 
here's one thing thats possible of happening is that a lot of people might nor agree with changing the voting process because they dont want to learn a new one because they are so used to the one they already doing. Another one is that poeple might think things would go more worse if someone mad a change because of they way the votes are coming in and if you voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person 
in that case the vote would be thrown to the House of Represenatives, and who knows what can happen in that matter. 
General Motors once created a concept car that ran on a track, therefore creating smarter roads instead of smarter drivers. 
Community service is not always punishment for the bad it can also help you in the long run 
Attending classes online would give you the benefit of getting through school faster. 
Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. 
With the idea of no school, beaches, and long nights, students won't be focusing on work. Students then tend to lack academically because their brain hasn't been tested for quite some time. Brain activity never stops, even when sleeping, but it does forget how to preform in certain circumstances. Luckily, teachers understand that this happens because even teachers go through this mindset. They don't give these assignment because they feel like it, but because they know who teenagers are. If students begin to expect no work during breaks, this will continue to occur 
hen you ask mulitiple people for help, you can get a wide variety of answers that will help answer your question. 
What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Landforms common around American West. People say thst it's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. 
under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. 
Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong 
In doing so this movement is going to help out the econdomy and also the enviorment. 
The face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. 
Sometime out can not get your grades all up to passing in time. also i am not good at school but i still try.I think i should get the right to play sport because sports can be job when you get older and it will also keep you in shape just not that but aliened.So based on behavior i think they could not be able to play but just not because of bad grades. 
many children will not have the time to do work they shouldn't have to do, 
if there was an unforgettable moment or something like a cool memory to capture. 
producing many other benefits. 
But of course not everyone was satisfied. 
Many people still doubted that it was a mesa after this photo due to wispy clouds bluring the picture of the monument. 
Colleges in different states look for this and are amazed by seeing the things you do in your everyday life. Doing these sports and academic activities that you love doing can even give you a job all about the certain things you love doing everyday. For example my extracurricular activity outside of school is lacrosse which definitely made a gigantic impact on my life and I absolutely adore lacrosse and want to continue doing it in college. Which gives you an example from what you love in life brings you great things in the future. 
These people should be getting enough freedom to do an activity for at least a C average. They will lack in physical skills and it may even mess up peoples dreams. If you know most of your students maintain at a C average, then leave them like that 
when you are making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you out but when you ask other people for help and get their opinion it can relieve stress from yourself. 
Always turn them off during class and are only able to be used during lunch or any free time during school hours. 
Finally we see that the self driving car may actually be safer that regular drivers. 
So as you see principle TEACHER_NAME, this will eventually teach all students that helping out is not only productive but fun and will help you towards the future! 
The winner-takes-all is also a big problem. 
I think that my school and I should be required to do community service. I also think it should be a choice for students to say whether or not they want to do it, 
Many people at NASA want wanted that to be a statue or something that a living creaturs has made, but as you see in the pictures it starts to look more like a natural cause of natural cause. 
But is letting the machine take over most of the time really the best option? Could it lead to even more problems than it hopes to fix? These questions have yet to be answered and need to be. 
Projects already bring stress to students, especially since its summer and all students want to do is hangout with friends or do anything school related. Having a teacher design the project is both relieving and easier, because the student has a foundation of what to do 
The article claims that it could tell if a student is bored or confused, and could change the way the lesson is in seconds. This could help kids out with learing and could future their education. But with that computers would have to understand if a student is making a face to confuse the computer into thinking the kid is confused or not, because we all know that one student that would play with the computer to mess up peoples education for the day. 
Reducing smog, eliminating the stress of traffic, and preserving the environment, low car-usage societies appeal in all current circumstances. Progressively, the world may see a day where car usage is antiquated. 
I suggest for now on instead of using Electoral College we start using popular votings. If there is ever a case where the votes come out teied then we instead on using Electoral College, this would of be if there were to ever be a tired in the voting session. If this country is all in choices of the people and for the people why can we start to use popular vote instead.  
and learn the learning style of students. 
A large group of students would volunteer to get involved in community service, not all, but a good 30 or 40 kids. From a teen to an adult, students never like being forced into something they do not want to do. They hate having parents or teachers breathing down their backs telling them to do things. When you ease off the reins and give us some breathing room, there will be greater participation and overall success in what you're trying to accomplish in this case. 
it's new technology is very unfamiliar, 
emotions 
If you select the alternative policy, and not the first policy than students would not be allowed to have them of use at school at all 
The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited. 
My conclusion to this is that Venus is a dangerous place but I would like to see whats on that planet, and know if there really is any life form or oceans. If so the astronomers might take some life from there adn water to bring and test what it actually is. But they can't send people into acid atmospheres and scortching heat just to land on Venus. 
If you want to help cut back on the greenhouse gas emission than only use your car if your giong a far distance. 
Finally I can say that ''Face on Mars'' was not created by aliens 
In this essay, I will be showing how the face on Mars is just a plain everyday landform. 
These summer projects should be student-designed 
I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.     
Many countries including France, Colombia, and Germany seem to have no problem with limited car usuage 
First reason is it's none of our bussines. Also reading people's minds is something that is totally creepy. 
So i believe that people shoudl be able to have there phones people just need to be more respinsible of how they use them.   
Our founding fathers did not start leading the nation immediately, no they had to start form the beginning slowly climbing their way to the top.So that's what the principal must do.Community service will be kid's stepping stone on the way to success, think about the possibilities, won't it make the school proud if they knew that because of them, the old school bully because of community service, grew into the senator of California? 
This planet is more so off by it's so that its not so close to I think it would be interesting to read more of his books to see if he's that intot it with those too or it's just that one book that they have! 
There are also the many unwanted results from electoral colleges, such as the 2000 election's outcome defying the people. 
Most students that play in a team could play the sports that they like. You can start feeling healthy after a game of any sport, and students can enjoy the nature when there outside. 
if you try new things you'll probably find something that you'll actually like, 
The number one fault in the electoral college is the electors themselfs 
Additionally, students that come from less fortunate backgrounds may have duties at home to perform, like caring for family members or working to make money for the family 
but that feeling can get out of hand 
in school students are more likely to pay more attention. 
They could finish a call or text before they begin driving, leave the phone alone while stopped, and put the phone on silent or do not disturb when driving. Most phones now have a driving more that will mute notifications and send a text back to inform the person they are driving. Even if someone is not driving they can still help. If they call someone who happens to be driving, they can say they will call them back later at a better time. 
By the students getting hands on learning they would have a way better chance if understanding and remembering what they have learn threw out the whole day. Students would not also benefit from being able to attending classes from home because the students not getting commutation. If the student do not know how to do something they would depend on the teacher help to see it visually and get it broken down to them step by step hence the video call can do the same but do the student really understand it on video or understand it more in person because the teacher can get know the student and understand there problems and then figure out a way to make it more better for the student the are teaching. Students would also not benefit more from being able to attending classes from home because by the student receiving a more educational resource. Education Resource consist: field trips, experiments, and group effort which the individual will not receive if they are taking a distance learning. Additionally, Distance learning would take all the fun and all the other benefits the students would want to receive for example: clubs, sports, and extra help on the class they need help on. 
So in conclusion, students will never succeed if online classes are always holding them back. This is why I urge you now to get up, take a stand, and fight for what's right! 
The Electoral College is not perfect and it may be called broken by some people, but in all truth it isn't. 
and it aviods run off elections. 
This could bring up averages quite a bit. Students may not like the idea at first, but if quiz games were added within each subject the students may like that more. You could also have certain days for certain subjects to focus in on problem areas within the subject. 
Not very many people really understand what the electoral college really is 
I don't like that if you vote for one person, the rest comes with, that's rediculous, what if I want this president but not all his stupid underseers, then what? 
Students can be assured that they will have a project that they can complete when they design their own project, instead of one that may be too challenging or that they might not have the resources to complete. 
Why would aliens even want to put a face on the planet. Im sure if there was aliens on mars they would'nt be carving a face on there own planet 
It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election [source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our dispised method of choosing president]. 
My claim for this story is people are trying see how are people feeling in a picture and trying to hdie thir emotions 
This could also help keep students safe 
you do not know the accuracy of the information gathered when only from one person 
Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. 
As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology. 
Like every month the school could pick one service to make a certain grade do and then we could make a huge difference. 
It is a real landform that was caused by natural things that happen, it was no alien monument. 
second, the more people you have by your side are the best choices you make. because they support you and will give you great advice. And also giving small talks (advice). because they know how you feel and know what you like to hear from others. finally, it could help to improve ideas and thoughts you might ve had in your head. because you think how you plan out your ideas without making a mistake. 
receiving help from a teacher or an instructor would be more limited and restricted if one were to take an online course. 
The Electoral College wants the best for our country and is trying to benifit the USA, not cause it harm. 
In conlusion the face onMars will and should be considered a landfom. If it was made by aliens we would have found out thanks to all these studys but all of the studys we have made have proven there to be no life on the planet Mars. 
Having a deadline is much easier then feeling rushed to do work. 
because a student might not get a subject therefore that student has a lower average. 
Have you ever had a hard choice to make and needed a lot of advice? Is it easier to just listen to one person's opinion or many? 
In conclusion many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but say is a natural landform. Some people may have counter calims first counter claim is why would NASA lie to us. Second counter claim is that the picture showed a face so it is a face. Third counter claim is that they had a good camera so if it shows it then it is a face. My rebuttals would be that NASA is not lieing about the pictures. Second the picture might create an illusion that makes you think it's a face. Third not all cameras show exactly what you want to take a picture of these are my counter claims and rebuttals and also my example and explanantions 
Well not everyone was happy about it not being an alien 
Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states "no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. 
The aliens didn't know what we look like or what a Egypion Pharaoh would look like. 
Why would aliens take the time to make this landmark if they were just going to leave and never come back. 
The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out. Driverless cars are no longer a thing of the future but make up our present in every way imaginable. 
Car-free cities seem to be more safe. 
I am the few students who are in the middle 
if we were to drive less 
The Electoral College helps keep the certainty of outcome in the votes. 
Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. 
Do you like to travel around the world? Well if you do you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens. 
If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. 
The bell ring's and its time for lunch or break time. Now, finally you can use your phone. 
the most important part of this is that we have to be safe. and do things the right way 
I think the face is just a landform bacause the picture is actually showing is a mesa lanform that can be mistaken by a face.The face on mars can be related to some things on earth like the middle of the butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. 
The Face on Mars was found 25 years ago by the spacecraft Viking 1 while it was snapping photos of possible landing site for ship Viking 2. While snapping its photos it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face,some people believe its a natural landform others believe it was made by aliens. 
Let me explain why this is unfair, each state only casts one vote, so a delegate from Wyoming reprents the vote of 500,000 while a delegate from  California is supposed to represent 35 million! there is no possible way for one person to be able to speak for 500,000+, everyone has their own opinion. Everyone belongs to a political party; not everyone belongs to the same party. 
I don't recommend that you should require kids to do this I'm just saying that you should get kids who want to help, come and help. 
Even though many teachers claim that they are very close with their students, in truth, they do not know much about what their students do. During the summer, aside from going on family vacations and other recreational activities, many students have responsibilities like volunteer work, internships, jobs, taking care of siblings, and etc. that take up a lot of time out of their day. Teachers do not know a student's life outside of academics and will therefore not consider these aspects of their life. As a result, teachers will most likely design a project that could be very time consuming and strenuous for students. However, if the project is student-designed, it would be designed knowing that students have other responsibilities outside of of academics. 
Many supporters of online education say that it significantly reduces the chances of social problems that arrive from traditional schooling such as bullying. 
during yearbooks if your teaacher tells you, you can get out for class and go to different classes and take pictures in there classroom and post them in the yearbook. Also you can take a camera with you and take some cool pictures there. The yearbooks can be awsome because you can take pictures of fun and funny stuff in a classroom.  
people may think they are voting for president when there not (even know they shouod be).we are really voting for electors. i dont see where it is right that thoses electors have to fight for are vote. we should be able to put in are balliets and that be it, not worry weather the electors had a good agument and won the fight. 
Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? I feel they should be more favored to being student designed. Why would I think that? Why can't teachers determine the design of summer projects? Im going to tell my opinon why. 
As many people know, there is a big need for energy on Earth. As a result of this, the Earth is running out of fossial fuel and that is one of the reasons the Earth is dying. If humaity lived on Venus there would be a big source of solar energy, which is renewable energy. 
Also, in the elder department it would also be a big help for children at our scho 
For instance, out of all the presidents we have ever had, we've had many good ones and few bad ones 
This process makes sure that there will be a winner. 
With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. 
Sports and other activities include teamwork, motivation, and consequences.These 3 things are not only needed to help students achieve in sports but to achieve in school too.In the classroom, students need to know how to use teamwork and motivation.This will allow them to use teamwork in groups to help improve ones grade.And motivation will cause one to achieve their work assignments.And having these available to them, they will know the consequences of not using them correctly.These will result in bringing students grades up.Making you happy with their grades and them happy being able to still participate in sports. 
YOU HAVE A POINT HEREto not allow students to use cell phone on school grounds 
They are many thinks you can't Lerning at home you can use by way of video or online. 
Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy changes a persons life. 
In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.   
For example when people say that the electoral college is not taking into consideration to what the people said but only caring about who they want as our president. 
The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College. 
For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home 
scientist should keep studing venus. 
Some activities that students are able to participate in are sports, yearbook committee, student council, and helping out with the environment 
In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is "almost 97percent carbon dioxide" with a surface temperature averaging "over 800 degrees Fahrenheit" and an "atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future. 
This allows students who are sick, or have emergencies come up, to attend classes and to not fall behind. 
i personnaly support Luke for caring because he didn't have to help people survive. 
Teachers are with their students the whole year so their most likely to know what each student struggles on, it may not be the whole class that struggles on one topic but the point of the project is to go over certain topics so you won't forget them. The main reason students take test are to see what they struggle on or lack knowledge in and with the teacher designing the project it will focus mainly on those topics. If the students were to design the project they could focus to much on one topic or may not include the most needed topic at all. For example, if it were a math project the student could struggle with their multiplication tables but have more knowledge on everything else, the student could forget to include the multiplication tables or they could just focus lightly on the topic they really need. Teachers could include a guide or some helpful tips to make sure that everything that is to be known about that concept will be there. Students could have payed attention to the topic but still couldn't comprehend it, the teacher could know some tips and tricks to help make it easier for a struggling student. Including helpful tips could also make it easier for the students who have learning disabilities. 
Knowledge, it is one of the most powerful things in the world. How do people gain knowledge? They gain information from their mentors, teachers, coaches, parents, and older siblings. People are always learning something new everyday, from how to do long division to how to make friends. The school districts are creating projects for students to do over the summer so they can continue to learn while out of school. 
you dont need to use your car to go down the street, or around the block. 
this will save the pepol like 1,000,000 dolers a year 
It's dangerous in because, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent cardon dioxide blankets venus, their is also clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, on the plants surface temperatures avaerage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then whats in our earth. 
in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair. 
Electoral votes is what we need but some disagree 
Its nice when your friends ask you to do something like going to another country and helping people out. When you go and help people like Luke did just think about those people and how they felt about you helping them with getting food and water. After your done helping someone in need like Luke did it kinda makes you feel happy that you did that for that person. 
When the Author says that technolgy will be your best friends for ching out space and the other plants and get information for you the auther is correct. 
In comparison, students will be given the same amount of work when assigned these projects. No one student will have to do more than the other, unless given a choice 
First, Michael Malin and his MOC took a picture of the "face" and claimed it to be just a natural landform. 
I suggest that all students in the school be required to have to do community service. 
I think people with a b average should be able to play sports because there grade is a little above average 
4 out of 10 friends start in extracurricular activities. Lots of people who meet while doing a sport or a club end up staying friends for life. School is an amazing place to make new friends. You will never know or experience such great things unless you try. Having a friend that enjoys the same things that you enjoy is good too because you guys can relate on many things. While you go to practice you will always have a partner and you guys can even practice together outside of school. 
The teachers at school are also a very big subject 
The advantages of limiting car usage 
we in the school can to ask help to a companion when we not understand some and to be a big help have somebody that us help in thing that we not understand. We have classes in home to remove the benefit of to meet to other people and also in online or video conferencing not the to show as to make a exposition in public for example: In a few work we needing to pass to the front and explain the work, i think that the classes online will not teach us to not have pain talk in public but the school the teacher us to teach to pass to the front for that us to lose the fear and the pain. 
Driving is a thing most adults and 16+ teens do, they use the cars to drive to work, school, or go to a place where they can have fun. To teens driving is the first thing teens will do to start taking the responsibility of being an adult, but for some reason even though you're supposed to keep your eyes on the road teens and adults alike are on their phone texting and driving which is as bad as drinking and driving. 
but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.    
It gives students, at home sick, the opportunity to keep up with the pace of the class, instead of missing a day. 
If all of the states would have same electoral vote then things would be harder because we mostly at some point will have a tie 
Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want. This could necessarily not reach the teachers standards and question if the student even learned anything at all. 
The lesson in this story is that "you never know whats going to happen if you take a risk".   
but it is not as good a trade, cell phones, and better grades. 
Lastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. 
Asking for advice from multiple people can give people different ways to resolve their problems 
let students gain leadership skills, 
it will be less problems with people they think if they give up there cars there will be a safer street for everyone 
TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at. 
Now for someone who never does their school work does not have a job and just sits around on their lazy butts all day long those are the people that should be doing community service 
So therefore drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. It is a distraction. It is one of the leading causes for car accidents. It is also a very expensive ticket so I encourage drivers to stay away from their phones while driving. Unless you absolutely need to use it. 
In addition,the they're outcomes in the electoral college like in the year of 2012 an outcome happened. It happened when they were voting for Romney or Obama. Obama recieved a 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the the popular votes for him and Romney. That happened when the number of votes possibly was 538 thats an even number of votes. 
Cell phones do not make any difference in a lunch time setting. They do not disturb anyone around us, and they do not harass the learning environment. 
In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody 
In the picture its a lot clearer then the one took in 1976. They did this by using "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry" to clear the picture up. This is another reason why its not a alien made object but a mesa 
It states in the article "Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong" "It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. 
school gives them proper socialization 
I vote yes that we should keep the electoral college in. 
This may reflect student desires, however, it does not reflect what is best for the students education. Summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students because it would be in the students own best interest. 
In that they just wanted to make better ways for humans and computers to communicate. 
There are some people that can't be in a crowed of people because it causes them to get anxious. 
to atend some after school activitis 
Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. 
The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. 
It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy 
Talking to more than one person ensures that you have at least one person to fall back on after you made your choice. 
The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars 
in this article it says, ¨ all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and aroung accidents¨(7). Showing how dangerous these smart cars can really be. If the car can not work properly in the condicions that are all around us, what makes them safe to have on the roads? As the cars keep devoloping the more dangerous they will become to us humans, if smart cars ever get to the point where they truly are driverless it would not be neraly as safe to be out on the roads. This is because these cars are know to have problem with changes in the road and when they notice this change they are programed to alert the human driver. Thinking of that, what if a child were to run out onto the road, how fast can this car really react, or how fast could this smart care alert the human driver? 
At least ever body is not doing with there class work. 
They should change to this because then they will know the actual amount of votes. And because they can see how many people want that person to become president instead of the electors because what if one of the electors changes their mind and goes for another person. Then that person can't revote and they are stuck voting for the person they do not want. And if it is changed it may cause problems politically. 
According to the studies conducted by the National Safety Council, it was shown that using a cell phone while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year with 390,000 of them resulting in injuries. 
This reason being is because of the weather conditions venus have erupting like valcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes that hits the surface. These conditions are far extreme then anything on earth. The conditions on venus could crush a submarine accustomed for diving to the deepest parts of our ocean. But still NASA is trying to figure out a way to send scientist to venus so they can study the palnet more. 
And Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, 
When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists. 
its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. 
A claim that evalutes how well the author supports the idea is "Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." 
These are strawman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system 
The article "Does the Electoral College Work?" states, "...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for you candidate's electors." The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong." talks about how you can't control who the electorals you chose vote for. "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don't let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people. 
participating in an online course allows for a lack of communication and ideas from other peers, 
These are the reasons I believe that asking multiple people for advice can really help you make decisions. Choices in general are very hard to make, especially if you're an indecisive person like I am, so asking other people for help is something I do often. I've received plenty of good advice from when I've had issues with my family or other friends, and with the advice I was given, I was able to make the best choice I could. Even if someone else's opinion is unwanted at the time, later on you can really think about what that person said, and you can choose what to do. I believe that a lot of the good choices I've made in my life are all thanks to my friends, who help me out. Through them and others, I will continue to take advice and make the best choices. 
Another example will be getting to do all the work from doing it in bed but yet still doing your work 
In conclusion, No it is a natural landform. It could be a computer image hicup.The land erodes. There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.But, it still might not be natural. If it is unnatural then there could be other life out there. 
If you would make this a requirement for students 
The first reason is that it is unfair to voters and presidential nominees. 
you could to this to stop in increes of smog in our enviorment and even help with traffic jams. And without traffic jams eveyone is less stressed out and a lot more happier. 
Also what was the main reason why I took this opportunity. Was the main reason because it was opportunity of a lifetime. Think it over and find 3 main reasons why you took this opportunity. 
Other might think it isn't fun at all 
With all these complications though scientest still are curious about this dangerous planet. 
One reason people seek multiple opinions is because they want to go with the majority of the people. 
Online courses are often catered towards those who are taking an online class during the school year or have a full-time job. As a result, the provided resources are more concise and fail to include information for subjects that may be ambiguous, causing students to apply these concepts incorrectly. Students are unable to understand the curriculum, as compared to their peers attending school outside of their home who are given more thorough instruction for topics that online school programs may not provide an explanation for. Moreover, for those not extended the opportunity to video conference with personal tutors, students can not ask questions in real-time. Having to email your teacher about one question can end in a string of emails with the student still confused. Those who can inquire in person, however, better comprehend the information and are ultimately better equipped to understand future curriculum in subjects where each topic builds on one another. Mathematics, for instance, is cumulative. Without understanding basic Algebra, a student can not understand Calculus. Similarily, those with a lack of learning and information struggle in the future when told to apply more difficult concepts due to their misunderstanding of simple concepts. 
Candidate what do you think of when I say that word well If I had to guess a said president. President that when  each party selects a president that the people  trust to help this Nation. 
Community service is the gift that keeps on giving, without it I truly believe without what purpose does man-kind have. I want to take this special opportunity to ask you may we do community service? It would be a great learning experience to the kids. If we do this surely the kids that believe helping is wrong will change their minds. 
Wyat Gibson, former scientist from NASA, 1976. Today, spacecraft one has captured a image to what looks to appear as a face. Scientist figured it was just another Martain mesa. "Only this one photo had unusaul shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh. 
It is now in films, magazines, books, talk shows, and haunted grocery stores. The face on Mars is a natural landform. Many people have experienced the face that appears on the planet of Mars. 
and i think the facial actial action coding system maybe good maybe bad. 
There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student. 
we should have field trips going to homeless neighbor hood and helping teens ,kids ,and other people 
the negative aspect to this would be that the cars still arent truly driverless. 
The candidate's get to choose people who will vote for the person who picked them just bc they picked them. They probbaly dont have good reasons on the they pick that candidate they just pick him/her because they picked that person. They candidate who did win the election their electorial voters get a przie just for helping them win the election. And the others well they get nothing. It's not fair to the other people who voted for their apponite. All they get is a "Thanks for voting". Presidents voters get a cerification for helping them when. It's not fair to everyone else 
In the story "Paris bans driving due to smog"talks about how after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It says that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day, I think that this should happen all around the world, so the world can be a better palce to live in. Here is a fact form the stroy, " Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had a 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London" 
there would be less accidents, 
I really think this is a good idea, we can know if the presidents or old history people were happy or sad.             
When you help someone else you don't just help them, you help yourself. 
One of the things that is wired throughout all three sources, is that electoral votes basicallly overpower the votes of the average citizen. 
If their is a tie in the electoral votes than the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state deligates vote on the president. 
For example, a student will not have a instructor to discuss certain problems they have with a topic. There may be a teacher designated to each class but they may not be accessible to explain one's questions. Whereas in school, a student can visit one of their teachers with a question and receive a one-on-one discussion that thoroughly explains a problem 
For example, "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning..."The Office of the Federal Register , this shows how it is not really fair to all the states as even if the popular vote comes close, the winning candidate takes all the electoral votes. 
To begin, the electorial college isnt good for the people because they dont always know what there voting for 
Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision (Richard A. Posner 20). 
The writer to this story certanly convinced me that we should not study Venus anymore 
So thats a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy .It happend in 2000, when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.obama recevied 61.7 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney .... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely ....nixon in 1986 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the elections .there  is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the vote cast;that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electroral college, which invariably produces a clear winner....knowing their vote will have no effect ,they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote ...!       
In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the "Face on Mars." 
Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers 
to begin with i consider all students must have a cell phone in order to text their class mate to ask about the home work from last night 
I feel as if you should keep the Electoral College as it is. 
Sometimes electronics can malfunction so who's to say that the car will always stop, or that it will always tell you when to slow down. Although it says "driveless cars" the vehicles still require human assistance. Like the passage says "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?" 
I think that ultimately this is just a coincidence because if aliens are real or were real we would have got aa picture of one or saw some remains of one. And the rock is probably just a mesa or a big landform that was made by weathering and erosion. The face of the rock is most likely just shadows from the camera angle and the sun. And another thing, when the camera passed over the mesa, it was a cloudy and rainy day, making the camera lens wet. 
different perspectives on issues. 
But the bad side about the electoral college is that what happens if thr president you like is a republican but you like the democratic senator? Well i dont know what your going to do then because going to be a problem. 
If someone needs a ride after school and there are no cell phones, there will be no way to communicate with your parents or get any help. 
At certain schools around the world Students act bad and just act up in general at school, and teachers dont seem to do things about it. If kids played sports more the school would gain a good reputaion. Sports are always fun, more people need to get there gets in sports like how the schools wants them tooI believe that we should have all schools make kids certain sports, in certain times of the day. Like In elementary school you have gym after a class. We should tell parents that would want there kids to do activities that they would enjoy. If we had Students playing sports everyday then lots of people would be happy, plus who doesn't like to have fun once in awhile 
In times of a tough decision, seeking multiple opinions will help in making a better choice 
The question that may pop up in a lot of consumers mind is what if something goes wrong wit the system of the driveless car? 
The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those el  
Instead of working hard to perfect an area in which the student struggles, they would rather choose something that is easy and would get done quickly. This is why it is better if teachers gave students their assignments 
Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? 
Your air will be as clean as a whistle. The only thing bad about that is that those gases actually keep some places warm,but to other people it justs "melts the ice caps.". 
Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesnt really list any benefits to exploring Venus. 
More people prefer the direct vote because under the electoral college system voters vote for for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. acording to the article in reason one."In 2012 obama received 61.7 persent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romeny. because almost all states award electoral college votes on a winner- takes-all basis". 
You also have to think about the people who disagree with changing the system. People can stop voting if they dont like the system. If nobody votes,then are country cant move fourth into the future,and if that happens the USA mint have a civil war. From a diffrent stand point it mint not be a bad thing to get a new system. This is just another reason why we shouldnt change the system of voting. 
There are a lot of great reasons to join the program. 
it say in the article that "a classroom computer cand recognize when a student when a student is becoming confused or bored 
"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." 
what to do when you and your best friend get in a fight and you want to fix the problem but you do not know how. 
In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.  
I dissagree with the fact that the state wants to keep favor of electoral college. I think they should change the way the whole election is set up by using popular vote for the presedent of the united states 
Blind and deaf people can now at least get cars that can be modified to adjust to their ability, but as these driveless cars are just being made, it would take them even longer to modify them for the disabled to use. Even without a disability, the cars would be like taxis, so what about people with social anxiety? The driveless taxi causes them to leave their home and fetch one for themselves. Social anxiety is an illness and affects most people one way or another. Social anxiety can prevent someone from doing the simplest of things. Things that even a mere child could do. That's another problem with the cars, what if children run away in them? They have the ability to, but at this point, there's no law against it. 
You could bring your friends and family and you could work together. You could make someone day shine with a smile. You could look around the ocean and look for animals. That what would be fun. 
and lastly Venus has a very thick atmosphere of a poisonious gas. 
the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on earth. 
even though it will be really hard to get anyhing back from there 
Almost every kid remembers at least one first day of school memory when they were little or even this past year. Well, that connection you made with other students and your teacher was an official eye-to-eye connection made. Unlike looking at a screen four hours on end while being taught, having the physical opportunity to talk to your teacher either in a whole class discussion or one-on-one is much more effective than an email or text message. There was a study done by the Freelance College in North Dakota, many certified scientist studied the difference between learning through videos on a screen at home or being at school learning through a teacher. Both groups were taught the same thing and took a ten question test on the lesson that the teacher had taught. The statistics showed that students who stayed at home had a test average of 75%, while students who went to school had a test average of 97% The students who worked on the computer at home had a shorter attention span because their teacher was physically not at their house teaching them, thus caused the at home students to do poorly on the test. Overall, this study clearly shows that students learn exceptionally better with eye-to-eye discussion in real life at school. Being able to communicate with a teacher one-on-one or in a class discussion really makes a positive change in the students academic performance. 
A few days or even weeks without cars is a great idea for reducing stress and air pollution. There are even more reasons why we should have a car-free day like time conservation, emission lowerage, safety improvement, and resource conservation.  
WEdont even really vote for our Electors. "Well who does ? " you ask. The state conventions ,sometimes the state party , sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. We should be lucky that the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century ; but this process could end up getting much worse like in 1960. The segregtions almost led to no more Democratic electors. We still proceed with all evidence as to why we shouldnt have Electoral Colleges. 
i strongly believe in keeping the electoral college to be in chare of the way the elections would proceed instead of changing the outcome of elections to popular vote 
While some may say that kids have too much free time and we should give them something to do so they aren't on electronics, 
You also must know that the system has its faults 
its good for states like Texas, California, and New york. 
its also called the " evening star" is one of the brightest points of light in the noght sky, and its also the esecound planet from ourr sun, its simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point ofpoint of Earth, it has proved a very challnenging place to examine more closely. 
Not getting enough sleep effects the productivity of the student which could prevent them from finishing papers on time then having their grades drop. Which could all lead into depression 
In paragraph the author is describing how Venus was like a long time ago, covered with large oceans and that it could of have supported various forms of life. The author also describes how the planet looks like today with rocks, valleys, and mountains. 
It's becoming too much to bare. Despite the happiness and comfort they gave you all those years ago, they've changed. They're being more critical of you and your other friends, they have been asking you for money frequently without paying back their debt, and are being rude about you not spending time with them, despite them barely spending time with you. Despite you telling them about your concerns, they haven't stopped. You think it's about time you cut ties with your closest friend that you have known since your elementary school days. You ask your mother about what you should do, and she gives you her opinion from the outside looking in. You understand her thinking, but you're not quite satisfied with her answer. You feel as if you should ask someone else, but its not because you dont respect your mom's opinion, you just want another bit of advice. Why is that? Why do we feel the need to get more than one piece of advice after already receiving what we see as a satisfactory answer? 
The student council i don't feel like any student would really want to do it. 
I belive that the people should get the popular vote and that the Electoral College should not be kept because it doesn't exactly help the people. 
these people or voted on by inndividuals to vote for there nominee president. these people can be trusted on a high level because of there preactices over the years. 
Many people may not agree with me but new can be good 
Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels. 
But noticing ourself that it wasn't true that it wasn't real. 
If the program is open up the community would have a better image of itself. The trees and the grass would look healthier, the school would even have a better image too. Graffiti that used to cover up some buildings walls, would now look even better. 
Despite a student not having a hobby that is provided through an extracurricular activity, by joining a club they may discover a new passion. For example, the Fiber Arts club I had joined also included knitting and felting activities. While at first I was only focused on doing what I was comfortable with, I soon got interested in the other activities that were available. Through this, I discovered new hobbies I still enjoy to this day which other students may also experience. 
but they don't know what it's all about. 
for example, some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. A lot students take the opportunity to finish the school online. Person take that opportunity is because they have another weigh, for example, they go to work or stay in home to do nothing about his life. 
And most of the reason that people want to stop it is because they think that some of the nominees arent getting what they deserve. 
If that were to happen then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where people in the state would decide on the president. 
Like when Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority in Electoral college. 
A copious amount of books are accessible in the school's library and can easily be checked out without the student needing to find transportation to the closest public library. Devices such as computers, printers, and laptops can be used by students to complete and turn in homework. Various teachers in schools have gone to college and are experienced in their subject and can go more in depth into learning material if a student did not understand it. Teachers can also explain topics in a way that allows all students to understand it since people learn things in different ways. For example, auditory and visual learners benefit from online classes more than students who prefer hands-on experiences. Schools also have enough funding to be able to provide outside-of-class learning such as field trips to museums and inviting guest speakers. 
Some may argue there will be inaccuracies with popular vote 
in a way did making a happy face make you slightly happy in the artical it tells us by making a happy face your muscles not only expresses emtions but they will also may even help produce them 
For the people who think community service is really weird, t 
Students who don't have any activities to do after-school should sign up for a sport or club because they could become really interested in it and keep doing that activity throughout the school year. Students should join extracurricular activities because they could be fun and it could be a new experience. 
If you think that alliens made the landform, I would suggest you look at the picture more closely. Just because its on a planet like mars doesnt mean it was made by an allien. 
Lastly, in some states, using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money 
Communication is another key life skill that having different views on different things may come in handy. 
I hope that you choose to become a seagoing cowboy. 
One way is to have your phone out of reach and on silent so if you get a message or a call you won't be able to get tempted to reach for your phone. Another way is to use an app to block incoming texts or calls. Some apps can send an auto response back, letting the sender know that you are driving and will respond when you are not driving. And one way is to be committed to not texting and driving. 
last one is that it could be a lot of money to get in and most likly to fix it. It is a lot of work getting one of those and the thing is why buy it or even consider it, if it is not offical. 
Please try and give this idea a chance Principal. 
youll make somebody happy by just saying have a wonderful day today like the person grading this test i hope you have a wonderful day 
One reason why I think that we should have mandatory community service is because it provides knowledge and experience for the child. 
Venus is likely the most similar planet to Earth, with its rocky surface, hills, and mountains, but it has much more limiting factors to deter us from traveling there. It has terrible weather in comparison to Earth, with acidic carbon dioxide filling 97% of the atmosphere and with heats of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The authors gives plenty of information about this planet, most of it relevant to the topic at hand, and therefore succeeds in teaching you about Venus. 
stiving ot meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becasse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded ot meet the very badges of imaination and innovation. 
the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency, 
So a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful presidat. the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfrabchished that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, that he really isn't their president. 
I hope as we move forward in life people can learn from each other's mistakes. Texting while driving is the worst thing to do you can . loose your privilege or suspended license. Even worse you could kill someone while walking. So the question is does it really worth texting while driving?         
It could be argued that public schools are cheaper and that they can supervise younger children for free while allowing parents to work 
just knowing that your helping someone in need is gratifying 
Advice. Advice can be important to many people, and most of the time they ask multiple people for it. 
Another example of why exploring Venus is a good idea, is that we can discover new speiceys or materials, mabye even find if there were ancient life on Venus. 
There are several reasons for which I do not belive in the process of the Electoral Collage, 
So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference 
They did this as an attemp to take the popular vote from kennedy. This just shows how much freedom the electors have with your vote.    
Trying to exceed the challenges showned by Venus has its uses because human cruiosity will likely lead us into many equally problems in the futures. and our adventures on Earth should be limited by dangers and doubts but a determination of that should expand our very limits.   
because the college is fair to the people -because they represent the people- and the college is a smart idea. The college works in everyone's favor. For those that disagree, there is always a strong chance that the candidate represented by the elctoral college will not win presidency. 
With the students work load teachers give them, they wouldn't be able to have time for extracurricular 
"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. 
We don't always have to depend on technology to do everything for us. 
In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be. 
It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a "fake smile" and that to them "faces don't lie" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that "moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things. 
The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is "a good opportunity to take away stress..." (Selsky). As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude. 
Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population. 
Luke's claim was a great claim! 
When asked to complete a project they are interested in, students are more likely to complete the assignment and be enthusiastic about what they learn in the process. This elevated engagement presents itself in increased academic achievement, including higher scores on standardized tests, and better retention of material, instead of forgetting it as they continue on their academic path. This level of engagement and the associated benefits is lacking in teacher-designed projects because they do not cater to the interests of the students. These projects miss out on the benefits found in student-designed projects. Thus, while teacher-designed projects may share short-term benefits such as better understanding of the material, they do not maintain the long-term retention necessary for later successes such as boosted standardized test scores. When students design the projects, they are able to create a more engaging experience that leads to better learning. 
for learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process. 
I think not,its not a good idea to mein 2 ways. 
its just not fair. 
this story was about diffrent plantes and how eveything is set up also hoe everything be taveling in the earths eveviorments a ns solar systems. 
But if you do force them they probably learn some thing and when some try new thing they have fun and things like that. 
The Electoral vote consists of 538 electors. The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.I just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government. This only happens Every 4 year so you got to wait a long time. 
, for example that it hasn't really been discovered that aliens actually exsist. Throught the years of 1976 and 2001 there were pictures of the face not yet comepletely form so therefore scientist think it took 25 years to form comepletely. 
I believe in weird landforms because it would make since that they would get there from either destrution of something else or creation of another landform. But why doesn't NASA send a space rover to mars to scan the face and collect some samples from it? 
In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow. But if we frown, the next ad will be different.When we are looking in the mirror:* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomstic major and a different muscle, the risorius. 
students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, 
Summer projects are some of the most dreaded assignments to give to a student. However, they are very necessary in order for students to retain information needed for the following school year. 
I think it is a good idea, because everybody can just help out and talk to each other and make new friends. We can grow plants together. And when vegetables and fruit are ready to be picked we can take them home and someone can make a pie 
for example paragraph 6 says "if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similiar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next add will be different. also classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, and could modify the lesson for the student. FACS works by whatching 44 major muscles in your face to see how they move to determine your expression. 
I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice 
Students should have a right in deciding what they want to do. 
it gives students the ability to work at their own pace, 
Summer projects are no fun, but they are a great way for students to be engaged in their studies over the long summer break. In my experience, whenever I had summer projects given to me by a teacher, I did better in the class because on the first day of school I already had some knowledge of the topic. 
When i was in Africa we do community every Friday because we need to improve in our physical fitness and do some work 
send goods to people who need yor help the most. 
In paragrpah 5 it states that people can tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. I totally agree with it 
Everyone has a hobby or something they enjoy doing at home why not just do it at school with your friends. 
it helps avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It says that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hopes of carrrying their state. 
but that is still very rare. 
By the president being elected off of the electoral process it is allowing the congress to vote and having the congress vote will not put the president we won't in the chair 
but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important 
Teachers, however, should design these projects 
A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long. This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects. They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience. Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail. 
Some may disagree and say that online or video conferencing classes are not beneficial to students because they are not reliable enough to capture the actual environment of how a class my be like if a student were to attend it in person, resulting in an online student attendee not learning as much as a student who attends the same class in person 
not organized 
, Mona Lisa has 83% of happiness 9% disgust 6% fearful and 2% ssanger. According to some new computer software that can reconize emotion the sofware is the latest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the unversity of amsterdam. The process begins when the computar constructs a 3-D computar model of the face: All 44 mayjor muscles in the model must move like human muscles movement of one or more muscles in the model is called an "action unit" then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscle 
While driverless cars seem new and exciting, they aren't practical.I don't think that having these new cars is a good idea.I feel like there are a lot better ways to spend our time than trying to develop this car that we don't even need.We are doing just fine with the cars we have currently. 
With the face on mars no one belived that it was actually a face they thought that it was and ancient monument on mars and when NASA first saw the face on mars they thought that it was the landging place of the viking 1's sister ship the viking 2. Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon. So the face on mars was alo just a huge rock formation and the eyes nose and mouth was just an illussion formed from a shadow. Also about the alien articact their was not one they thought that their was a hidden alien artifact and hidden alien marking hidden by the haze. 
In conclusion i am with and against distance learning. 
the different interests that students have in relation to the same topic. 
Obtaining multiple opinions for your problem is helpful for making the right choice because personal experience or wisdom is helpful, helps take away biased opinions, and multiple opinions from others is always better than one opinion. Who would care about others opinions, finding the answer will be almost impossible. Multiple opinions can limit the bias you have previously been given. Why would you even want to obtain opinions from others if they are all bad, well that's not true, opinions from others can be good for you to listen to. Wisdom form others should be a big part in the choices you make. However, you will have to be sure that they persons' opinion you are listening is trying to help you. Opinions come in two forms good and bad however you must do everything in your power to only listen to the good and not harmful opinions. 
Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. 
Summer break is typically a period of time where you can take a break from school and work and be relieved from all sorts of stress. But some schools assign students to complete summer projects to provide them continuous learning over the three month period time of being absent from school. The projects can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which one should be assigned to the students? although both sides can be debatable student-designed projects might be less difficult 
In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even with the dangers on the planet. 
in Source 3 "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky it says "Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving he streets of this captial city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This example shows how they limit car usage in Colombia. 
some of the studends have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The studend taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other studends that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home. 
Some may like, and some may not. Reasearchers show the putting on a "Real Smile " can make you happier and change your mood. 
In this essay of the Electoral College it is questioning to see if the Electoral College realy works 
Reuniting with the Seagoing Cowboys could be wonderful, you will have a great and adventurous trip. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you won't even realize that the time flies by because of the wonderful time you'll be having. I think everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it will be educational and you will help many people that need help and meet many people because, of the World War II and you will be able to experience outdoor natures that way you are not stuck inside the house playing video games or watching TVand instead help those that are in need. What places would you visit if you wnet to China? 
This can be fun 
I would tell them that the face is not created by aliens because if it was there would be a sign of some sort like there could be possibley more then one of the faces. Also there could have maybe been a symbol of some sort that could tell you or us that it may be out of this world. So studies tell us it isn't a alien monument because well when you look at the picture or image that was taken in 2001. 
going to a second opinion is beneficial towards your decision making and ultimately will help you in the long run with whatever issues arise. 
Many people believe home schooling is a way better option then being at school because it creates more of a comfortable environment for the students 
say if your shy and dont talk to nobody try going around asking people for their opinion on something and you ask how that can improve your ability to talk to people well it improves your ability to talk to people without being scared it really works because the more you do it the less afraid you are to talk to people. 
This new invention tells us that faces never lie. For example,"these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being thruthful." This can help the media or the news channel's to give the most accurate information and all the bias can stop. This on the other hand has many other benefits to it. 
Luke was offered a trip to Europe on a boat by a friend and of course he couldn't say no. So Luke took the offer but World War II was going in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. A group called UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the animals that were shipped over seas.According to the text in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war was over. Luke turned 18 the day before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. He was discharged in 1947 but Luke had already made nine trips the most any Seagoing Cowbody had ever done. 
Just because there is driverless cars coming soon doesn't mean that people can just drive them around whenever they feel like it, its same as being a car when you have control. You still have to watch out and go the speed limit, you can't take it and sleep when it's driving. 
While some may argue that student-designed projects will lead to lazy project design, this can be easily negated while also ensuring that students have an interesting project that they are able to complete over their break. By allowing students to design their own projects, they can choose, for themselves, an interesting topic that they are interested in studying. They can also ensure that the completion of the project is possible within their own summer plans. Student-designed projects lead to project interest and completion more than any teacher-designed project ever could. By having students design their own projects, it ensures a unique and interesting learning experience over their summer break. 
To help the community or to not help the community, it's a question asked by many teenagers of this generation. 
It states that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing pluraity in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success of the President. 
if the NASA cameras did not see any people/aliens. On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world 
The students who enjoy these extracurricular activities usually are concentrating on doing their best in sports or their extracurricular activities, if we could move their priorities without side effects we could be able to reach higher levels of learning although a grade B average sounds like the best thing to do for this, it is not. 
My principal recently decided that all students should participate in an extra curricular activity, and I totally agree. 
We can make the trip to venus but you cant even see it you will by flying over dense clouds and if you go under the clouds it's very hot 
one of the reasons it have een chalnging to use 
Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service. 
I think the author thinks studying Venus is worthy based of the author saying in Paragragh five althought it is 170° F(Fahrenheit) it may be difficultt condtions, but it still survivable for humans. 
Being curious helps you find a better belief about a situation you are not sure of. 
Also if you forget something at home, then you can use your phone to see if your mom or dad would go back and get it for you. In addition, when the school has a jeans day, but you forget you can call your mom or dad to get your some casual clothes for you 
Does the manufactorer who made the car get blamed, or does the driver who purchased it take responsibility? I personally belive that these cars are an assumed risk and that if the car is in an accident, that both the driver and the manufacterer are to blame. I believe that the driver could have attempted to do something to change the cars path, but it is more so the manuacturers fault becasue their car failed to stay in its own lane and out of the way of other traffic. The blame also depends on who was inc ontrol at the time of the accident, if the driver had control of the car, it is his or her fault. But if the computer was running the car, then it is the manufacturers fault. 
For instance, in Generic_Name's situation she asked three of her friends what to do about her toxic friend Generic_Name. Two of her friends told her bad things about Generic_Name and gave Generic_Name more reasons to stop being her friend, whereas only one of her friends told her to keep being Generic_Name's friend. Since more people reacted the same way to the situation, Generic_Name now had a more informed opinion and a better idea of what to do. 
What if something tlike the disaster factor happened again and someone voted for someone that wasnt in their party. Or if an election came to a tie what would happen then the election would be thrown to the house of representitives, where the state delegations vote on the president, because each state casts only one vote ,the single representitive from wyoming, represents 500,000 voters. but the electoral college avoide run-off elections meaning no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. 
This technology to read and find out the emotinal expressions of students is crazy and weird. 
the United States is a great place and no one wants to see it go down hill from one wrong mistake. And the solution is very simple, let the people vote. The people's oppinion are very important and need to be heard! 
and they need time to do their homework. 
The dont need away getting nowhere if its online classes. 
some schools are better then some schools in the county of virgina. 
It will also be important to them, so they will work hard to make it the best they can. My favorite class is psychology and whenever I have a project in that class I want to spend extra time on it and make sure it is good because the topic is important to me. A student designed project is also benefical because students are only outside of school for the summer and on short breaks, so why not utlize this new freedom of being out of school to allow students to design their own project they are passionate about. 
it could tell your teacher whats going on whether you need help or not 
When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, "[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" and further explains that "[the system] could modify the lesson" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can "identify mixed emotions" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged. 
In paragraph nine it states that "our traffis laws for our states are under the assumpiton that the only safe way for a car is to have a human under control", and thats beause our traffic laws are based on human error. So basically if a said law is broken then the human gets the bad end of the deal, but if its a driverless car who will get the blame for a traffic law being broken the company that made it or the owner of the driverless car? Also in paprgraph 7 it basically said the car can drive its self unless if it needs human help and that the driver must always has his or her hands on the wheel. Basically saying we are able to regain control if needed, but what if we couldn't because the car is acting up and then we get injured or get others hurt. 
because scientist figured it out that it was just another Martian mesa, 
Now you see why you shouldn't change the average levels. It could make a huge difference in the students and there love for the school. 
It would also be better because the kid can talk their friends on the other side of the building. 
Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is "bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide." 
They could run the vehicle of the road, or ey sencers could nowfunction. Say you are going down the road and a little kid runs out infront of you. In a regular car in i can brerak every time, but in a driverless car if the fuse is bad or a wire is loose it may not tivate the breaking system, becuase the sencer was not working. Now imagion for me if you will that kid that ran out in the road was your own child. Young and inocennt with so much life before him/her. Would you really want a driverless car to be the one it ran out infront of? 
It happen in 2000, with Bush and Gore where Gore had more popular votes than Bush but less electoral votes, and we all know would won that year. 
When you try to make computer models on your own at home wit a PC it might not work on yours ether way because you'll need a newer model of it so it can work it doesn't have enough storge to carry all tha data, so some people rarely take the long way which is writing it down for instruction that encode different emotions. 
Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidates and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please 
Many childrens' hospitals have school-like systems already in place and communications with a patient's school so that no one falls behind in their studies while they receive treatment, 
The team that is un-defeated always looks best for the school. The school who is invincible in this sport. 
So the best thing to do is to have community service on some days and get people who want to do it so the choice is yes the principal should but get people that enjoy community service. And for example like if i were to be doing the service and i enjoyed it then id want to keep on doing it but is i didn't enjoy it then i would be home doing homework. But also have it after school and get people who can stay to perform the service. 
There is always a solution to everything like having a car holder and putting gps rather than calling someone. 
one reason car usage is being limited is because of how much pollution it brings to the environment. 
Under specific occasions google has had cars driving since 2009. Their cars have been driven more half a million miles without a crash. They arnt truely driverless yet they alert the driver when they need to take over the wheel when traffic is really badd or going through road work. Futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday isnt just the smart cars its smarter roads. How much smarter did the cars ned to be? in the 1980s automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. within a decade those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors could make the car apply brakes. In 2013 BMW anounced the development of traffic Jam Assitant the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,But speacial touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer in traffic and other road construction. This necisates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem has occured. 
The auther has good pionts he claims the average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees and that the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. 
I think a good addition to this system would be some type of reward system that would give kids motivation to actually do the community service 
Plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble. 
These classes are there for, students who might have serious sickness or a serious issue. They will get the education they need like every other student regardless to any problem. It might be different from a real class but, it helps the people in need. Some students might be going through stuff, for example getting bullied in school and, not being able to go back to face negativity, others will make up their minds to stay away from something like that. 
Projects help the teacher get a better understanding of what the child may need help with in order to get better at the subject and/or to pass their upcoming Standards Of Learning test.There is a boy at my school that we are going to call Generic_Name. Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. Generic_Name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with. He completes his project with just a month left of summer and now has a better understanding of the war for his next year of highschool. 
There are meny reasons im against the Electoral College one is that I want to vote for the president 
To conclude this mess of being unfair these are the main reasons why people  would love to get rid of the electoral collge and go to poular vote because it is unfair dealing with the "winner-take-all system" and we aren't really voting for the president but instead the slate of electors.      
I think it will be boring becuase you would be to that same place many times. Plus you would see nothing but water. Most likley the boat will smell like a barn full of anamils. Then you would also have to lift all that straw and bags of oat around the boat. You would have to clean up after them. I have 2 cats and I have to clean up after them and lift the bags of cat food. Boy let me you it is a hard job. But the worse part of taking care of my cats is when they get sick all over the floor.So I dont really see why taking care of 100 some horses would be fun. unless you like horses. Then you would be working on the boat durring a war. that would be dangeras. Plus you would never be home to see your familay unless they came with you. But that probly wouldnt be allowed.What if you get sea sick? Or a horse gets sick and spreds it around to the other horses? What if the boat springs a leak? A lot of lives will be at risk. Plus what if an animal that you are alergic to comes on the ship? What if the engine breaks and you cant move? Or you run out of food? What would you do? or if the lights quit working while your in the fog or its nigh, and your right in the middle of an ice berg feild? that would be a very rogh time. Or if some one needs medical attention what would you do? or if the caption got sickand it spreded around to the other crew members?that would be a verytough time. Plus there would be noone to feed the horses becus evrey one would be to weak. 
The face on Mars could be there naturally 
Plus the cattle that is on the boat and there is more from where that came from. 
people get to vote on which thing or person they want to be president or vice president and without it people couldnt run nor vote for who they think would be better at running office 
To others its a dumb but a smart or nosmart thing to do but my opion is in between its a hard thing to agree on. 
those may be boring, nasty etc, but just always know you're doing something by helping your community. 
Scientists are discussing further visits to its surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its was once most like planet in our sytem. Venus can probably could been covered by a ocean and could supported various forms of life. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been sending people to study Venus. Scientists still discuses about futher visits and NASA has send people to study venus. 
Students make everything interesting. 
i dont think all cars should be driverless some people might like to drive themselvs at there own pace and there own speed . 
because they can never hear the real truth everything is the truth to them but if you deep and deep and deep youll find more and more things that to get suspious and you question yourself but youll never get to know the REAL truth because our government is corrupted and they lie to us Americans every time there is misery.    
because they are more distractions 
We get a variety of ideas, get more diverse outlooks from many different people and perspectives, and some people having more qualified opinions from different people, is why its so common to get as many points of view that we can. If we want to be as thorough and informed as possible, it is crucial to do just that. 
Heidrun describes this life as a happier one and that cars make things tense 
it's thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus for a even more challenge the clouds have a high corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. the pressure is 90 times greater than what we exprience on our own planet. 
Some excuses might be, " I have too much homework to do after school", or " I already participate in many after school activities, isn't that enough"? 
Like Earth, Mars is a planet just with different features. Our earth forms mountains and hills due to erosion and our plate tectonics. It's naturaly formed by the planet. No living organism created the rocky mountains 
Also not everybody want to do it. 
I'm going to agree with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. they all wanted the electoral collede to be abolished. there is no need to have them if we have the people in out states. 
You also get to help people that are in need in other countries 
Online classes are cheaper, 
The exploration of Venus is worth while scientific endver. 
Before I explain more about why it's a good idea for teachers, I want to talk about how i feel about FACS. It something that i never heard about and i think it's somewhat a good idea, but i dont recommaning it to put it in a A.I. It would get a bit weird and creepy if it's in a robot, but that's how i feel about it. Back to the topic, if a teacher is given out a lesson and some students don't get it they use the FACS to see if they get it or don't. 
A teacher-assigned-assignment forces their student's to do schoolwork that they're just doing to get done or because they have to, not because they want to learn. In a system like that you dont learn anything and you especially don't have much fun either. Student's should learn to have fun but also want to be eager to want to be educated and want to learn something new. Telling the student's that the summer assignment is due on this day and get it done by this time or it's a zero won't accomplish anything but kid's that just want to get it over with so they won't receive a bad grade 
Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision. 
The only thing against the electoral college, is what we might call theDisaster Factor. 
The certainty of outcome is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote,because almost all states award Electoral votes compared to popular votes. 
"Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless." (paragraph 2)"Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020." (paragraph 10) 
If they lose concentration they could end up running a red light, not stopping at a stop sign, or even a wreck. They could also run off the run or into something. 
and the place where we count the votes 
In the article it says Venus is referred to as Earth "twin" and it's the closet to Earth & the also call Venus the "Evening Star" its the brightest light in the night sky and a another fact I can say it's in between the Sun and The Earth and I think thats why it make it so special even though Mercury is Closer Too The Sun and in the text it says "Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system and Venus haves features that are analogous to those on Earth so in my opinon Venus has almost alot of things to do with or deal with Earth. 
peolpe and citizens have the right to vote for who they think would be a good leader for ower counrty. 
I think the author have a good reason to keep studying venus it is earth like with all the similar features besided from the high carbon dioxide and extreme storms and weather temperatures. 
Let the people vote for the person they want to not the electoral collage. I agree that the electoral collage should be change. 
These are all the reasons why I think we should get rid of the electoral college votes because it is more easy doing the popularity vote because it gives the people to speak on who they want to be president.   
I think it would be better if the canidates would vist every state and talk to them about what changes would be made if theyre the president. 
Some students stay home and take their classes online so they learn better and no socail life helps with you getting your work done but that not always the case of this situition . 
This should not just be something you can memorize a few vocabulary words and write down a couple notes for. It would prove absolutely nothing if you can simply study for this project and write down what has been memorized. To really take on this endeavor, the students will have to include everything they have been taught over their four quarters of experience. They must be graded on how much they really paid attention and how much effort they put into the class. 
The average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices. The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly. When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone. Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application. 
Seeking multiple opinions help make a better choice 
Do you think it was made by an alien or is it a natural landform? Many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but others say that is a natural thing. 
This could cause a variety of problems and setbacks, as human drivers may not provide the regular pattern that the driverless cars and the roads create. Human spontaneousness may interfere with the driverless cars and their sensors designed to alert the occupant of danger. This may cause a driverless car to swerve or react to some small movement of a car driven by a human, while if a human were driving, they would not have reacted, seeing as well as doing this regularly, they understand that there is no risk or danger to them. 
Even though you may believe that keeping the electoral college is a great idea and a benefit to all, its not. 
keeps things equal and right 
I believe that the election for our president of the United States should be chosen by popular vote and not by some random people we don't know 
Venus is referred to as Earth's "twin." Venus has the density and size closest to Earth 
In conclusion we have wondered how things are in Venus. We even wanted to know what would happen to humans if they went to Venus. There would be lots of information if we visited and came back perfectly. With all those information we got from visiting Venus it could help us with other difficulties from different planets. The Venus we know as of right now could be different as we learn more about it and find a way to change it closley to Earth. 
Five reasons why the Electora College should be restained despite its lack of democratic." The winners takes all bases". What is that, why would we use that. In 2012 President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, says in source 3: In defence of the Electoral College. My point here is that we "DO NOT" need the Elecoral College. The voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. 
Our solar system is huge there is alot of planets, and more uknown things humans do not know about. Many things can be floating around in outer space from other planet bigger or smaller. The peice of that planet or object broke off of could had of entered Cydonia atmosphere, and caused that landform to exist.Many things have difrent ways of cleansing, and many other different ways of doing things. We do not know if the planet Cyndia caused the unsual lamdform itself from amy kid of element storms and much more. 
Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. 
In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters.In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues. One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape. 
Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.    
with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students. 
In the article in paragrph 4 it says," the new emotion-recogniton software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or painted face of Mona Lisa"(4).This new computer can even exam you emotions on your face like it did on ona Lisa. Also, FACS even works on painted faces. It can tell if the painting of the persons face is happy not. 
All these things are reasons why I believe that ''face on mars'' is a natrual landform. 
The author says a lot about the dangers because there are a lot. 
reduce the unnecessary amount of time spent on the project and stress on the students, 
because many students now are sneaking in their stuff inside the school and teachers are not really great at looking for stuff. 
if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher's already limited teaching time. 
Just by making faces and using this technology, students can learn so so much more about their emotions on a deep level that can help in many ways. It would benefit students, teachers, therapists, and more. 
for example in the articel he claimes that Venus has so many features like earth 
NASA was looking for Viking 2 so they could find Viking 1's sister 
The Electoral College has been here for countless years and many people would be dissapointed that it's gone, people would drowl over it for a very long time, but there are good and bad avantages for both circumstances. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, that can sum up if someone wins or loses, a big disadvantage in the longrun. Over 60% of voters would perfer a direct election, if we got that voters would not be pressured at all and would have a very good vote that can be proud of. 
because they can still complete their course or courses task's at home even if they're sick 
We shouldn't even have volunteer workers picking up trash off of the school grounds because us students shouldn't litter. Every time a student litters they just make themselves look bad and the school, city, or neighborhood also looks horrible. Even though I don't want students to clean up another persons mess we should stop littering all together. 
I know some people don't like to go to school and they just want to stay home and play video games or sleep. Rather than going to school, but your parents still force you to go to school. And teachers look confused and saying whats wrong with our students. And don't know what to do. And most teacher are tired of students sleeping and thinking its a waste of their time and most quit. 
So, this concludes my theory on students doing community service. 
I read that people are now getting fines in Columbia because of there cars and right now i think that's a good idea 
Having children to complete all assignments at home is very dangerous. Especially when they're left to test on their own. When left to test during distance learning there's nobody around to check whether you're actually learning the information or not. You could easily cheat on an at home test and not even know what you're being tested on. 
Students engaging in activities that require a lot of physical activity such as sports, will be more physically fit and most likely healthier than those who do not. If someone decides they want to sign up for yearbook or student council, they will have the opportunity to greatly improve their problem solving skills 
Everyone gets to pick their sport or activity so that they will have fun doing it but still be working. They wouldnt have to participate in a sport or club that they dont want to but they would have to pick something. Everyone would have at least one friend because they have to work with each other all the time and they would learn to like each other. The whole school would be productive all the time and the schools systems would be improving every day. 
A classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored. 
or just to have a briefly talk about the test in class that they are giving or just to let the students have more freedom. also texting is being more widely used than any other devise in earth like face book or twitter they are both being used to talk on the phones know every body has a phone i am right yes because technology has been growing rapidly and faster then ever know on days you don't see that device what was it called oh yea the beeper because it took so much time to call the one typing it in and for her to send the message to the other person beeper that has become obsolete. 
The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, " who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?" 
To sum it up, there should be activitys it help the student you the reader better learn and buil skill maybe even find a hobby that you like. I think the people that go against this shouldn't but that my opinion, and the reason I think they shouldn't is because it helps benefit learning it help the student refresh so they don't fall alsleep in class o start day dreaming because if they stop listening how are they going to learn. 
The students can choose to use it or not they wont do it if they dont want to thats like making u do it. Some students will be surpice and some afraid of what might happen to them if something goes wrong. The technology makes alot of great things to hellp us who needs it. Teachnology can end up with the world if bad people do bad things to technology. I just want to be safe and have technology that helps me do good in my life. I maybe use the facial action coding to see how my emotions are but not use it for fun every minute 
In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. 
Also if they do go to election school they could learn how to run for pesident and learn how to write speeches, and also teach them that some of the 50 states in the united states have to have his/her vote.The out come of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then the outcome for next year will maybe bet higher or lower. When ever a US citizen votes they are also voting for the electors canidates. and when you do vote that person who is running for president that helps his/her's group get elected. Every president has to have a Vice president.    
but chnging it to popular vote would be the best option 
A outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, just look back at the year 2000 it was less likely then a come over the popular vote the Reason for that is the winning candidate's share of the Electioral College expanded his share of the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. 
Smog in Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have reached record pollutions and both cities do not want to deal with it any longer. Robert Duffer writes about how the Paris government enforced a new rule which allowed both even and odd numbered license plates to drive on a certain day and would alternate everyday. This was very beneficial, however some people needed transportation but would be fined $31 if their car was used on the wrong day. Being that Paris is one of the most famous capitals of the world, one would expect to see more smog than usual. Andrew Selsky also writes that in Bogota, Columbia, a day without cars was put into place in the 1990's and still continues today. Once a year, buses and taxis are the only transportation allowed in the whole city. If not obeyed, there would be a $25 fine. This day was put into place as an improvement campaign which also benefitted the city. Bike paths and smooth sidewalks were put in and during rush hour has cut the traffic in half. It also opened up restaurants and shopping malls which were widely used by the public. 
The mountains that are being formed my natural landforms are making faces in mars 
The overall idea im trying to express is that the Electoral College is a poor way to show peoples opinon, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the President of the United States. 
Luke signed up for the program just to experience what the journey would be like and his friend asked him then they would have to ride with different kinds of animals like horses. Luke made nine trips and was brave to make that choice. But lukes friend decided to invite luke on this trip so luke was pretty glad that his friend invited him. then luke and his friend were asked to take care of horses,young cows,and mules.Luke then decided to take his traveling a whole new level especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Luke decided to play games on board like basball,volleyball,table tennis he was also fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. well being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. Luke had so much fun being a seagoing cowboy. and leading his family hosts a number of international students and exchange vistors for many and many years so when people bring up seagoing cowboys they can remenber that it is a jorney 
So summer projects should definitely be designed by students to expand their creativity, let teachers grade with time and no stress, and better their learning experience. Not only will students have a great grade on their summer project, but these skills that they are learning and using now will be very useful in college and in the work force when they're older. 
because Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 thimes greater than what we had to experience on planet Earth. 
students don't want to be in the class rooms all day just doing work or any other thing, instead of having fun with the other kids, and talking to their friends. 
, #1: Try new things but don't go too far with it. 
they could actually help and doing something for others, instead of doing what they like to do.As the months past by we see that Our country is not the same, for these problemsFor example, Littering, Robbing, Pollution, etc. 
but education is more important because it will help u get into college and help make money to support your family. 
"The EC is widely regarded as an Ananchronism"according to the article posted by Richard A Posner. Once again yet another reason to Abolish the EC 
Next, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of th winner take all system. In each the candidates don't spend their time in the states that have no chance of winning. 
Secondly, there isn't actual proof that aliens created it anyways. 
it allows students to show their own creativity, 
In conclousion the author is very into the study even if it dangerous and makes it intresting to read. 
half of the team only is doing so good because of us needing a c average and i don't no if they can get the b average. 
i don't think that its fare to not allow phones in school at all. I know that were' re in school and we are there to learn, but shouldn't we be able to have some kind of reward for doing school 
it really be a waste of money imagine all the things we can do for other causes 
This gives the person seeking advice more time to decide how they feel. Time is needed to make a good decision so taking your time is strongly advised. It can also result in more in depth thoughts. The end result will conclude in a better final decision with a better reason behind it. 
You can also split the people that are helping into different groups to cover places more in the region. 
While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states 
Also some poeple may not like the fact that they are a computer is able to read their emotions and may reject this tool. For some students it may not even help them and would rather talk to a teacher for help rather than use a computer. 
Community service is important in the world because it helps support ideas like cleaning up our neighborhood to helping the needy. If we didn't have community service, the world may not be a place like it is today. But, everyone has to consider that it is a persons preference to choose to do community service and that they are not forced to do it. Our principal may be doing a good deed in saying that everyone should have to do a certain number of hours of community service, but some people may not be able to and they shouldn't be forced to do any work that they don't have to. 
IN conclusion keeping the electoral college will be unfair and unjust to us people. 
We should just go back to basics and have a normal vote system 
I don't think you should allow students to bring there phones to school. There would be to many problems, and our school doesn't need that. Students just need to get a good education. Come on isn't that what schools for? For all students to be successful in life ? 
Another reason to study Venus is how similar it is to earth. 
Exploring countries, towns, and cities is something you definetly should do on this job. You can even explore the ship. While exploring you can bring a friend to experience it with you. 
Because NASA is truying to find a way to give Venuse back life. NASA is not only trying to give Venuse back life, but also to see weather it is living grounds. In order to make sure Venuse is the right planet to give life to NASA has to find out the presure and the oxigen levels. 
The Electoral College lacks of democratic pedigree. Why is that? Because of cerainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and avoid run off elections. They all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. 
For example in the article Does the Electoral College Work it says that the Electoral College votes by people who are profetionals and popular vote is by the people of the United States of America. This quote explains how the popular vote is better because it is decided by the people not the government. 
Take cooking as an example Gordon Ramsey had 4 mentors to get where he is today if he didnt have all 4 who knows what kind of chef he'd be today. When you ask 5 people you can fit there opinions together and get a better outcome. Kid President once said "Use your brain". I bring this up because 5 opinions is stronger than 1. It's using more brain power! 
the votes of the Electoral College outweigh the votes of an everyday citizen, 
Plus the driverless car idea would use half of the amount of fuel we use today. 
According to astronomers, Venus may have at one point been the planet with the most Earth-like features. 
Venus is same size in density, and size as Earth. The planet had rocky sediments, craters, valleys, and mountains. But nobody can visit or get a up close look to venus because it has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide, highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The weather is extremely hot the average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we are experiencing right now on earth this is stronger than any sea level on earth. If we were to have another pursuit to Venus it would not be efficient because we dont have the right equipment to survive on that kind of journey 
This is a major issue with distance learning; if everything is done at home, then kids will never have that push to be more social. 
Or when somebody got hurt real bad and they have no information or number for your parent or guardian, but you have a number of their family members or friends, it would really help. 
There are several reasons, well first i dont know what this people are doing maybe they are being paid to choose the president it dosen't mean enything that they got more ethoes than the rest of the state 
Projects are designed to help teachers grade the student on how well they know material or a subject. 
i personally do Not believe in aliens , well would you blame me ? We have been to the moon, we have had a rover on mars for years ! and what do we get? nothing , just a rocky surface . no aliens , no water , No life period. 
However, NASA is working on some approches to get to Venus 
In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects. 
Big states: 
This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness 
schools should have summer projects that are designed by teachers. This way students would be more benefited due to the teachers knowledge on the topic. When the teachers do create the project there will be more clarity on what the student should do. The students will also be able to get a feel of the class in the coming year.  
its great to travel hopfully you'll concider it 
however, chaning to election by popular vote will cause mant disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic. 
We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. 
Student's won't be able to do after school clubs or the band. You won't have the big welcome on the first day of school. You won't be able to go to the school games and cheer for your school you won't have fun like the student's that are in school. 
Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers. 
I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet? 
I heard that you were deciding on whether we should or shouldn't do community service as a requirement. 
There are three reasons why it is  important to keep the method of an electoral colledge. 
I would like to explame the importants of Electoral College. This'll explain what it is,its defenses to the attacks on getting rid of it,and finally why it was created in the first place. 
and are sometimes unhealthy because of the lack of exercise 
Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive. 
Have you ever had to face a daunting challenge, and wondered why you didn't seek multiple people's advice for help? Whenever you find yourself in a new situation, there are plenty of people willing to voice their opinions out to you. 
One reason why you should put this policy into action is because if the majority of the students have a grade C average at your school, then SCHOOL_NAME would lose many team members 
NASA should stop showing it to the public because they know what the face is, and people dont need to worry about it. The face starred in a Hollywood film, and appeared in books. NASA argues that they need to get the information out to people. Critics argue that people dont need to worry about it and get freaked out about it. The face was on talk shows, checkout lines for 25 years, and in magazines. 
Some students will dilike what their teacher has provided them with . This being said it wont be enjoyable and will most likley they wont do it or wont learn anything because they wont be doing it or paying attention to what they are doing. If they dont do it or pay attention to it they wont get the learning experience the teachers want and with it being summer time they will probaly dislike their summer as well. If they dont learn anything there was no point of giving them the project . It should be enjoyable for them so they can have a fun leanring experiance and also have something fun to do over the summer and it being their choice it might make things extra fun for them . If they get to pick it they will proably be happy to be told they have a project to do over the summer and it being vacation they could also come up with something alot more funnier and a better learning experiance then a teacher could. 
That is why I will do my work so I can play sports to get a scholarship in sports. 
When you get home schooled you dont have to worry about teachers telling you what to do, but until you get that video call on your laptop. 
some peoole want to know is other plants save to vist . 
Yes i do think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
This will allow students to fell as if they more freedom, treating them like adults. If they feel they are treated like a grown person, they might start to act like one. 
the point is that school's should start using the new the technology to help students stay in school and helped them to stay focus. 
Our votes are just a back up plan and we are not important. 
For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible. 
Venus is a very challenging place to go in visit Venus because the human ceriosity. 
" your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity". How would you feel if your principle has made this decision?, and would you agree with this or disagree?. 
There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car. 
The Author talks about how the scientist have come up with a new old idea of using a computer made of gears and levers, 
because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also even more challenging are the clouds. They consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. 
Teachers and students rely on technology so often and for so many reasons. Whether it be school work or just for entertainment, there is no harm to add a feature that reads emotion. The price should be looked at as just a number, and human emotion and feeling should out rank that in importance. The FACS computer is someting that schools need to be looking into for the care of their students.   
When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says " Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes." This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that "4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind." When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving. 
In Conclusion, I believe I will soon be able to see the day where our community is safe, where there is no global warming happening, where the streets and fields of our community are free of debris and the elderly are not frightened of getting too old where it is hard to see or walk because they will have children to rely on. 
So Luke went on a journy with his friend and there was 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed the horses. Luke was going to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Lukes favriot thing was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Luke also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Luke had a lot of work like clean the stables feed the horses two or three times a day. Luke also found time to have fun on borad, especiallyon the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. The world opened up for Luke. 
social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to "quiet down" and "focus on their assignments", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers. 
I think for people who actually participate and really help out with the community service, they should get a little reward. 
the environment as a whole. 
For example, that person could want a necklace that another wants and they ask and the person says no, that person can feel negative desires for that person. That could lead to stealing the item itself, murdering the person and/or their family members, and/or robbing the store where the person got it from because they cannot afford the item 
Parents and children need to communicate, and they do this, most often than not, on there phones.If you took away the only way parents could communicate and talk to their children, all these parents would be upset, and of course worried.For you see, they would not know if there children were home or gone off to friends house, and they couldn't just call them up and ask because there phones would be with them, but at home. 
Students could also listen to music with there cell phones. 
I think if the student wont to do it then they should do it and get offered to get paid for it because nobody would wont to give up their free time for free. 
there is no telling what future problems may arise. 
Based on the articles,the Electoral College does knows best 
What if everyday we woke up with a good feeling, a feeling of empathy for others, our lives, and especially our own community within this fine country? We as the children or America must stand up, ignore criticism and judgement and just do the right thing. 
A reason why is because for just in case of an emergency , you just call your parents 
As it for being summertime when students have to work on their projects, it should be fun for them, as summertime is supposed to be time for students to have a break from school. That means not only they should enjoy their time tanning by the pool, vacationing, or even hanging out with their friends and family, they should work on a project that really speaks out to them, so that they can feel motivated to work on the project. If a project is assigned to students in the summer, it should be a student-designed project, so that it is more enjoyable/motivational, creative, and beneficial when helping them learn. This should help students enjoy their summer while continuing their learning.  
With recent generations of learners displaying less and less focus throughout the years, some might to disprove the effectiveness of student based projects. "Given full control over the projects parameters," one might claim, "students will become far too focused on obsolete details like font, backgrounds, and pictures." Someone who might hold this point of view believes a hands-off approach from teachers will only result in lower quality work and declining focus on the course material. 
The more perspectives you have on the topic or idea the better because the more ideas about it you can get. 
in my opinion going to other people for advice is a great choice if your torn about what to do. Different people mean different results. The more people more results. This will conclude my essay thank you. 
Let's take paragraph 18 for example, which talks about this reason. It states in lines 16-19, "A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but is highly unlikely..." Anything can happen, even a tie. 
A big reason is religions 
In this passage Luke is also worryed about him having to go into the tmillitary because of his age and at the time you would often be shiped off to boot camps and millitary schools at the age of 18. 
The article mentions, "Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars." This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information. 
Almost all students love Summer vacation. But this time out of school is also a major halt in leaning. This halt can cause students to fall out of the rhythm of daily learning and cause them to forget material taught during the previous school year. This is why schools started implementing Summer projects to keep students engaged in learning. Summer projects have been traditionally designed by teachers but some people argue that students should be designing these projects. 
When people play sports it also makes them more motivated to do other things and gain more friendships. 
Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" 
Activities for Everyone!Now everybody will have something to do!The principal just decided that every student must take part in an activity, before school, after school or even during school! 
In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely. 
If we did do community service more people would come to this town and that means more students and more money for the school! 
But not only it helps during class time it can also help outside of school 
Popular vote is a much better system than the Electoral College because unlike the Electoral College, it is actually fair for its citizens. America, which has suffered greatly to acheieve equality and liberty is held back by one thing-- the Electoral College. This is suffered by the United States' citizens because of the College's winner-take-all system. 
A popular story at Generic_School, is one of a student who had a below average GPA, but had a fantastic relationship with his Business teacher. He was accepted into a prestigious Ivy league school and after calling them, he found out he was accepted based off of his teacher recommendation. This story shows how having personal relationships with teachers is very beneficial. An online course teacher does not have this same bond as an in-school teacher, and this represents one of the many possible cons. Overall, relationships with teachers has a very crucial and important role in a students life. 
I remember back in 2000 when the flip phones had just come out and fast forwars 17 years later we now have a computer that can read anyones facial expression and tell us how they are feeling. I can't even begin to imagine how much more advanced technology is going to get later on in life, it already seems to be that we could possibly have all the technology we could ask for, yet people all around the world just seem to be getting better and thinking of smarter ways to invent new things. 
Overall people may think teacher-designed projects are better because of teachers "knowing what they are doing", 
Most voters that end up in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign as it states in paragraph twenty. 
I help the community out by cleaning up litter, donating my old clothes to the poor, also by donating canned food to the soup kitchen and by recycling. The people who don't want to do community service don't have to, they can just help out by donating canned foods or just recycling cans. 
When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to dissappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Diving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in every day life and even at work. Driving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remeber forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories. 
Cell phones have become very popular over the past years when it comes to texting and driving. 
These reasons why seeking multiple opinions are helpful are seen everywhere and have a major impact on the world. It has been seen when Europe found how to fight a disease, when one man switched the opinion of a jury, and how a democracy functions. 
because sometimes there are days where you forget something or don't remember to bring something. 
"It can be agured that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may  turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example or Republicans."(Source 3 paragraph 9). This is saying that it may turn off potential voter but is all a good thing. It is not a good thing beacause most of the people that vote for a candidate are not ven getting pick. 
I think we should have cell phones at school 
Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. 
In conclusion, this feature should be used in all computers. 
This will help for many toher student in school by not causing hram if they mad and aslo by helping student not get bored or lose fouces 
so that why I belive is better to have Electoral College in our favor 
First, the author despite the dangers that venus can be the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earth atmospheric pressure. Not one spaceship has survived the landing no more than a couple hours. 
"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. That was a discription of the Mona Lisa painting that the FACS gave. This shows how many differnt emotions she had and the machine was able to pick them all up. 
Because, students who stays home must of the time they will turn Lizzy, and they're not going to do work.Also, they will be behind, and it will be hard for them to study by them self. 
for example on of them can be orbiculris. It can teach the kids that good to show they emotions and how they show them and how they muscles act when they do them. Fothermore it can show the students that they muscles not only express emotions they can make them to. 
That could be true but in this case I do not think so 
On my second trip I was the night watchman my job was to report to the captian every hour to tell him how the animals were doing one rainy night I was making my hourly reportI slid down a slippery ladder and craked one of my ribs 
teacher-designed projects will prevent misjudgment of students by teachers. 
but you see it was ten times as sharper than it had been years before. 
Another flaw of the Electoral College also stated in source two is that "... "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...." 
Us using our phones help us keep in touch with our parents 
You would need more oppinions in order to see if it is a good service to work for. Everybody may say joining the Cowboys is an amazing idea but others may say it's a terrible idea. How much money does it cost to join the Cowboys, They never mentioned that either. 
because students who do not like to do sports or anything at all its good for them to do something to keep them busy and occupied 
The ones who don't know what an electoral college is we will get there soon just stick around. I am arguing that yes we should keep it because its important. The electoral college is the right to selecting/voting for president and vice president and people like that. Now to began on with the reasons i think it is important is that's a sign of are freedom to me that gives us a right to vote for who we want running this economy. Not being able to vote for this kind of thing could be bad because when we vote for the people we want running this economy we are choosing wisely because we don't want this town or anything to come crashing to the ground because of some man or woman who really doesn't care about the people they just want their name to be heard. 
If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school. 
Although many could argue that the Electoral College is a fair system of deciding the president, far too many people consider it non-democratic and unefficient for it it continue being our way of electing our leader. 
Another detail about Venus is that no spacecfaft has made a journey back from the planet. 
NASA finnaly figured out it was a natural land form. They even went back more than one time to check and everything still proved it was just a natural landform. 
When asking for advice the people asked also have an effect on your decision making 
imagine you have 8 people who have been caught and there was a murder. If you ask all 8 of them I garantee you will figure out who murdered the person. In paragraph 7, line 12, the text states, "They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one." 
You should announce this program to the whole school so many people can participate. 
In conclusion students should always be aware that they must help out the community but unless they are capable, in which they will be required to help, not have to do any difficult tasks and only small ones. 
Our country prides itself on being "the land of the free, and the home of the brave," yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.    
That's actually not all you would need to do. Not only do you need to make sure everything is working properly, you would need to make sure what ever is functioning the car is functioning correctly at all times. One of the biggest concerns could be a driver might not know what could be wrong with a car and if something is wrong with the system, he wouldnt know and the car would just break down or stop working. 
Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has. Venus may well have also been covered with oceans like Earth currently has. 
i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country 
Aviod run-off elections. 
In the conclusion part it talks about how you are suppose to smile. And putting on happy face works. If you make a happy face you are showing your emotions to other people. I think that a lot people should put on there happy face. Becuase they will be showing there emotions to people. I think that some people don't want to smile becuase they don't like to smile. Or they hate to smile in front of people. I wonder why some people don't want to smile. I think that some people don't want to smile in front people. Becuasue they are afraid to smile in front of people. 
In conclusion, I would like to say there is no actual evidence that aliens created the landform or that they exist. The Face was not created by aliens and is just made out of rock that happened to form into the shape of a face and as time goes on it looks less like a face. 
It is worthly to learn about Venus 
The only major issue that could arise is the problematic moment in which a "driverless" car's system would break. This would leave not only the passenger in the car in danger depending on the severity of the car failure, but it would also leave the other communters on the road in danger as well. 
The life of a student is extremely difficult; they are forced to do things that most adults cannot even do. They are told to somehow find time for everything: school work, sports, hobbies, family, friends, and most importantly to be a kid. During the school year, the fact that the student is still a kid is most times forgotten. Summer vacation is their chance to finally be a kid, or at least feel like one. By allowing the student to take part in a student designed project,they are able to take part in activities that they actually want to do, or research things that they are actually interested in. It is always hard to find compromise, but if given an option to satisfy students as well as teachers, why not choose it? 
I am going to tell you the reasons Luke joined the program 
People have try to get to Venus by senting humans and object there. But the danger to humans can be dangerouse to them. In the article, " The Ceallenge of Exploring Venus",these quote saids that, " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus." ( pargraphe 3,The Challenge of Exploring Venus.). " Even mor challenging are the clouds of highly crorrosive sulfuric acid in the Venus's atmosphere." ( paragraphe 3,The chanllege of Exploring Venus 
Most  counterclaims to my explanation is swing states 
I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies. Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water. As you can see in the first paragraph, where it also shows I have been to many other places. In conlusion, you can see that traveling a one of the most fun parts of beingin the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
Community service i think is a dedication and once you start you have to commit to whatever type of community service the person is doing and with all the things that some students have to do they cannot be fully committed to doing community service. 
There could have been something bad in your family and one of your parents might call to notify you what has happened, there's some kind of murderer in the school and the phones are out and cell phones are the only device to contact someone when you really need help, or you are on school grounds in a severe condition and there is no one else there to help you, you could either call for help or use your cell phone. I kind of support the use of cell phones even though I don't own one, I might ask for someone to use their's when I need to make a call. 
Emotion-recognition software can also be expensive for schools, especially since it doesnt work on normal PC computers. 
But it should be in school time since a person only has one life to live, and they better make the best of it. 
the people would be pleased with the outcome 
While we were in another country, we had some time to go sightseeing. I was able to tour an excavated castle in Crete. I took a gondala ride in Italy and saw the Panama Canal. I also learned a lot about culture. I learned how bad things can be in other countries after wars. It made me more aware of the people and their needs in other countries. 
Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. 
The second reason is Everyone's President 
The presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, giving the citizens more than enough time to decide if they are happy with the president they have or if they should elect a new one, 
allows students with injuries or disabilities to participate and allows students to feel safe while learning. 
For example he/she is made to join an activity and they feel left out because everyone else has friends and are talking too people they make them feel bad because they are not a social person. Another example is say that may not be a very athletic person and thy have to participate in a sport that could also make them feel like they are forced to do something they would not like to do and make them feel uncomfortable as well ,and thats why I disagree with making people do extracurricular activity 
Helping with community service may come in handy for making new friends. 
you can visit many unique places 
One of the best things about the Electoral College is that it's widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of the selecting of a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes wins. 
When I was in 9th and 10th grade, I had to do summer projects all the time. Even though I didn't want to do them, they helped me for the next year so my brain stayed fresh. However, doing it under the teachers rule felt like working in a factory, and it also felt like we weren't learning as much as we were just doing the project. 
Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. 
Do you think students would benefit from being able too attend classes from home? In my option I would say of course. 
Firstly, getting assignments done in class are hard enough as it is. If students are expected to get all of these assignments done at home, most of these would be completed late and/ or sloppy. 
There are many people that do no agree with this method. One should be able to put in there vote straight to who wins at an election not send it off to a group of people that one does not know. 
for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious. You can change that with new tecnology. 
multiple viewpoints can help you better solve the issue at hand. 
In the .U.S. every year is 6 million. More than 90 people die in car accidents everyday. All they will have to do is just stay off the phone and save their life's. I know everyone loves their phone because I love mines too. 
the article points are clear and strongly backed behind. The gives every expression that his new technology is good. 
The required summer assignments should be teacher-designed by the students upcoming teacher 
Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. 
And so that means that they also have to find out whats wrong with the air and how can they live in it 
The sports activities should be earned by putting forth best effort in your education. If students like sports and extracurricular activities, then they should think more about what they must do to participate in them. students need to think about their options first. Its sort of like cause an effect. If students get lower than a B average then it effects their chances of participating in extracurricular activities. Students must think about the consequences of their own mistakes. Just like many famous people today who act in movies and on television, they also had to work hard. I hard work is put into what you are trying to pursue then it can be accomplished or obtained. You just have to earn it. No one is just given anything in life. Those people earn what they have. 
Having different opinions can help an individual a lot, even though you may not realize it. Your way of life can come from your parent's, grandparent's, and even your own opinion. Therefore It is very good to listen to your peers, they might have information that you never even imagined to think about, they can improve your character without you even knowing. 
you wont have to worry about the hassle of having to call parents to come pick up the phone. 
Here is how we think that it is a natural landform, as it says in the article "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, se if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"and it also says "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. 
Introducing someones mind to different points of views, seeing how options weigh out, and gaining wisdom from others are all ways seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice. 
distance learning courses are beneficial for students whose family are on a budget because the affordability of online courses surpasses the attendance of a public school when accounting for all the additional taxes and fees that are put onto students who are attending a physical school. 
In cities like paris , because of the air pollution caused by cars, there is very dense smog ( source2 ). Air pollution is very important because the toxins in burnig fuel can be harmful to the healthof citizens. smog is not only a problem in paris , but all over the world . places like paris and Bogato have created things like car day , to discourage th e use of cars, because of that the air polluston on these places have reduced dramatically .(source 2 and 3). due to the efforts to reduce car usage , the smog and othe pollutions clearded up uthe air which showed that not using your car for one day can be tramindasly helpful to your environment. 
"LET ME GO!" Generic_Name shouted. Generic_Name was struggling to escape the breath taking choke hold she was in. Her mind flooded with horrendous thoughts. Generic_Name's date was trying to kidnap her. While she was fighting for her life,all she could think about was how she regretted meeting up with this dangerous,strange man. In hope to find a partner, Generic_Name downloaded a dating app. She was aware of the risks of chatting with and meeting strangers, but she was not bothered by it. Generic_Name was going to seek opinions from her close friends, but she knew they would not approve. Generic_Name felt that since she was an adult, it was her duty make her own decisions, and deal with the consequences without the validation of others. She soon found out that her decision was a bad idea. Generic_Name should have asked for her friends' opinions in making the decision to meet up with a stranger from a dating app. 
Instead of laying on the couch, eating, sleeping, overall being lazy they can make that brain work as if they were still in school, I'm talking about firing all 8 cylinders and constantly learn more on a rigorous daily basis 
You hear all these other kids calling and texting in class but don't get caught, then you try it and you get caught and your phone gets took by the teacher. You could never understand why that happens so of course you feel like your trapped without your cell phone. 
this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country! 
Student council is a good way to give back to your school, by showing that they appreciate your school and to show school spirit 
Each mission that was sent to Venus no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours. In paragraph 2, it states "not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." Not one person have been missioned to go to Venus for those reasons.In paragraph 3, it states "temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit." Also in paragraph 3, is saids "the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." These issues are way too dangerous for humans to be on. Solar power could be plentiful but the raditation would not exceed Earth levels. This may still be survival for humans.In paragraph 6, it states "researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." Like I have said no human has been on Venus because they will die right away 
To provide reasonings to my strong point, brings me back to paragraph 36. It clearly states in bolded writing: ''With all these changes, people who stopped cars commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit....'' Furthermore, the demographic shifts in the driving population have strong trend that I can agree with. When you are fifteen, you can partake on the written and reading portion of driving and as you study your way to reach your goal, you get your permit. As you ascend your way into the online session and the real world test, you'll find yourself receiving a license as your ticket of permission to be behind the wheel by the law and by the state. Car ownership turnmoil is documented and caputred by the state due to it's nonfundamental implications that's truly not beneficial to those who rely on taking responsiblity for their actions. But if the decrease in measures that can be jotted down on paper proves that you have overestimated your duties and perogative that will not be catergorically denied before a state court or driving school. Once you lose your vehicle, it's not about banning the driving, this is about how to teach the driver on how can he or she be better the next time. Taking away driving privileges and sorts of public transportation will ease it's way to find itself in a world where nothing will be run by anyone.         
I believe student designed projects are better 
students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs 
abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us. 
Not only does seeking more than one opinion on something help you make the best choices and be respectful of others, but it can also help you in the future. 
Furthermore, online classes are not preparing individuals to face the reality of the workforce and the legitimacy of this method is ambiguous. 
While some may argue that student-designed projects encourage lazy and uninspired design, by designing projects themselves, 
We should have our background checked on if we should vote or not because , people have faked thier identity and voted , or even forced someone else to vote for them even if they didnt want to. 
I think we should be aloud to use cell phones during free periods 
The idea of driverless cars is impractical and shouldn't be taken seriously. 
The electoral college is a process,not a place. are founding fathers established it so that congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president 
they wouldnt know when to stop 
Social interactions and collaboration with peers is a beneficial learning aspect that cannot be accessed at home. 
One why in the world would you want to know soemones mood you dont know what they were going threw thats history hwat they were feeling let the past stay in the passed 
Students would definitely benefit from attending online classes 
Principal such not do this become most students have c' s in there class 
driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. 
Popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can "get to know" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for. And yes they might spend a longer time in New york then Ohio but at least their spending time and educating the people on what they want to do and why the people should vote for them. 
Photographers job is to take pictures, and put it into a book, or a frame for people. Yearbook photographers take pictures, but what you don't know is, that they have to help the year book makers, and helpers to put those pictures into the yearbook, and the worst thing is, that they might not have enough people, some might be sick, or some might just not have enough time, and that can be bad sometimes. Lets say your a year book photographer, and your taking pictures, and your friend is sick, then you realize that you have to go through all the pictures you took, and pick which one is best, or which one seems yearbook appropriate. After you go through the pictures you then realize that all your friends in the yearbook photographer club are all either on vacation, or sick, so your alone, and you need the pictures to be in the year book by tomorrow, but you have no access to internet, because your friends are the ones that have the internet, and can turn in the pictures, then once everyone thought that they would get there yearbooks, they didn't, because all of one day and the day you needed your friends to be there. Let me tell you that, that is stressful, because some people could blame you, but it was never your fault. If this were me I would be so mad, because I would know I would get blamed on. So, being in an after school activity can be stressful especially in one you know your gonna have a hard time in. 
so i agree with the principal to allow student to bring to school y case of emergency if u need you can used. so u can bring your phone and used when you finish the school. :) 
all people have different backgrounds, 
Most poeple dont even really need cars they use them for the heck of it. Teenagers use it just to go around with friends or go to work but really they could limit that use and find another way of transportation. This isn't saying to just stop using your car but just findfing a way to say that if you dont really need your car but just using it for fun then you could limit that use and instead of driving to places that are close to you just walk there.The author of "The End of Car Culture" Ellisabeth Rosenthal even said that her own kids being 19 and 21 "have not even bothered to get a driver's license...." they find other ways to get around she said "they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends" as i said before there are alternatives to limiting the usage of cars and this could be one of them if you are with friends and all are going to the same palce then you ca just share one car so that not all of the cars are ut it can avoid traffic and cost less money to you also. 
Every student wants to go to school stress free and going to special activities is a huge help in that. If people have to maintain a B average, it can add stress, because they are so caught up into trying so hard to maintain a B average. Stress at a young age may cause students to have a more lonely life. They may not have a social life and be sad most of the time. 
Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has. Including phones,cars,and houses. 
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE?At long on the History, There's strange and curios case in the story of the political, especialy in United State of America (U.S.A) The political allways had serius problems, like corruption, the confusion of what president choose, the bad counting vote, etc. But with all those problems that happens in the world.. How United States choose good presidents? First, we are going to talk about the curius case in the U.S.A talking about the political and how U.S.A choose the future president. 
But what about walking on the surface to explore from the space craft? If we could walk on the planet without being harmed by all of the outside forces, then we coulf run more tests. 
We are a country that has been falsely relying on the people and lying to their faces about it 
Summer projects need to be student-designed 
Unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. So they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. Then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.They don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. Usually these types of people don't have malevolent intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. Asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. It also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. Which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice. 
Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may once of been like Earth with oceans and various forms of life. 
That is so important for me and my parents and for others stuadents and parents. You can m,ake a video online for attend class, because you need pass all the Esol well you need, for graduate. UIm so aprobe of my brother , because he help me a lot he's really lovely with me,and he have all the information from the school of me. Attend when you don't come at the school you aucent and if you have a lot aucent, they can kick you out, because you need to come and paid attention all the teacher said. i need paid attention all to my teachers, because they are important in the school, they teach you a lot for yours future and when you have yours own childrens you need to talk and help to your chils. education is all for your life. But, you need go every day the school and don't be aucent pass all the Esol well, Youe need work a lot and hard, if you want a good grade or if you want credits. Credits are important for graduate. Hawever, if you have all the credits, puedes recibir el mejor diploma. Is very important and not all the student have the best diploma, that why you need to work hard and don't skeep any day of the school. You need go every day and don't be late evry day .    
Also in paragraph four it says Venus was probably coverd in largely oceans which can also supported the various forms of life. Yet also Venus does have some features of Earth, Venus has rocky sediment which includes valleys,mountains,and also craters. Also scientist say that to visit Venus it will take a long time frames of space travel, and also if you want to return form Venus it will be very hard. 
Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. 
Driving while texting, as with drunk drivers, are less likely for a person that's texting to notice any signs, people walking in the middle of the road, and the signals coming from other vehicles. The larger phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, could help put something in their phones like an app, or app blocker, to help texters with their problem. 
If they want to make excuses, maybe you could have them do a couple more hours of work. And for theBecause students are fully capable of doing good for their community 
Taking online classes will have some guidance 
Yes, The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast 
that reason are: some stundents not have the same posivilites like another students they can go school , other students work a full time they dont have time for go school everiday , and other student like caming in this countre the other countre some times theo have more the 21 years old then they cant stared school because they old and the school onle recived people before 20 years old .In the united states people have oportunities for can gradute wherever you age and this oportunities is like you can make the GID diploma this diploma you can fine in school but yo go school after in the night some times. this programs is for doing more ease the life for people old or students not have time for stude in regular school this programe is better because is like the same diploma the hig school then peple have this deploma they can fine a job more ease and they can go some universite. 
Who knows who will become the president then! Not only will we not be able to vote for the president of the United States of America but we wont be able to vote for the vice president, governor, senates...ETC. That would not be fair, all that hard work and dedication that people put in to help the women stop sacrificing and vote and you all are going to put it to waste, you will not only dissapoint us but you will dissapoint the people who led women to vote 
Imagine visiting a planet like ours, maybe it was just like ours at a point where it could have living animals, water, and maybe even trees. Venus has the type of look because it the only plant that looks more like our planet the Earth. 
Because students are able to work at their own pace, they also are given more free time than in school education accounts for. 
The article, "What Is the Electoral College?" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, "Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit "swing" states. "Swing" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" written by Bradford Plumer says, "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong" states, "Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' 
time consumption, 
In most cases this is a lie. 
Traveling to Venus is a dangous task.Even with the right equipment and gear the atmosher of Venus still might not be safe. 
In conclusion, schools should not allow students to choose whether they would like to participate in extracurricular activities because it can decrease the quality of the clubs, create unhappiness among students, and cause students to be even more busy and leaving students unavailable for other non-school related activities. Giving students the freedom to be able to choose whether they would like to participate lets students have more power. Taking away that power and putting just another thing thats forced on to their plate will cause students even more stress and discomfort.  
like its says in paragraph 6 "Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored "Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication" noted Dr. Huang "So computers need to understand that too 
Some people have a hard time realizing what the Electoral College is even doing for our society. Me included. 
Auther did a very great job finding his resouces and fact about his story he told 
It's a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? Its the fact that we aren't really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. 
Plus the evidence has changed 
In paragraph 7 it clearly says(thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image on the JPL website but when it appeared it revealed just a natural landform.). There was no momument after all. 
Distance learning allows students the opportunity to take classes which would otherwise not be available. 
Driverless cars could be the way of the future or end up being the worst invention humans have ever fabricated. Driverless cars is a very good idea that could change the world for good. Even though there are some dangers, with research and time, these dangers could be eliminated for good 
While human interaction can be achieved through video calls, 
You could get people from the outside looking in, people who have been in that situation before, and even people who might be in the same boat as you. This will make it much easier to not only narrow down your views and options, but can give you all the parts of the story you need to come to a satisfying conclusion. Next,when getting your advice from different, more diverse sources, you might just find out new information that makes you less ignorant on certain issues. When getting advice from different people, you may just find a new outlook on something you hadn't thought of before, which could open up your mind to a whole new insight of your issue. When it comes down to it, getting different opinions from a more diverse crowd could be the difference between a good and bad decision. 
While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! 
Yet one paragraph that is arguing with wanting to go to Venus is "Each previous mission was unamed, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." 
I am hoping you think about my discussion and see every way that benefits the school to be better then it is. 
If aliens were to make The Face on Mars they wouldn't know the sizes of natural landforms. Also,even though The Face on Mars, is on Mars it deosnt mean that natural Earth things can't happen there either. Garvin also states, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,". 
Additionally, even taking into consideration that many school systems now implement technology in the classroom, this is still far less than a consistent full day on the computer required by online courses. By taking an online course, you agree to sacrifice your time and health. 
there is a certainty of outcome in the votes, 
There are some little things that need to be done to fix it a little like fir example the part thats stats that smaller states have barly no power and that most presedents dont even wory about then becuse they don't make muche of a difrance. 
Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa? A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof. This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures. Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact? 
Some people are very serious about their choice of the president they take their time to learn what the president could do for them and their state and country. So when that much time is put in to making that vote people would get mad if a person with an entirely different idea just takes their vote and places it wherever they want. 
Posner also writes that "The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. 
If this technology was in high schools I think the way teachers teach thing now days would be way better. For example, when the author put the mini lesson about moving you face in different emothions that was a good lesson. Just from that I learn that just moving your face around in different emotion could make you feel like the face you just made. 
These summer projects should be student designed 
I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right. 
According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country. 
Even though you say not to bring cell phones to school students still do it , some of the students need to bring there phones to school to communicate with there parents telling them that they're at school. 
because due to the planets atmospher light doesn't peneatrate very well making it difficult to observe ground conditions. It also limits the amount that you would see in pictures and vidoes of the planet. Many researchers are working on new inventions so macheines will last longer on the harsh planet.For example in the seventh paragraph NASA states that it has been working on electronics made of silicon carbon and they have even tested it a chamber concluding that it lasted in the harsh conditions for three weeks. They are also recyclaling old ideas from the 1800's, they are trying to use a computor that does calculations,but theinvention uses gears and levers, meaning that it doesn't require any electricity to work. 
English teachers will assign a student a book to read that will have a theme that will be talked about throughout the entire year. Which allows students to be prepared in class and even do better in class because of the knowledge that they have gained by doing the project. Students will already have some insight on what the teacher expects and how they run their classroom based on the summer reading project. 
In Paris, the government banned certain cars to drive on certian days. In Robert Duffer's article it explains which cars are banned, "On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered tro leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." Paris takes action in hopes to help their air pollution. The smog was so bad it "rivaled Beijing, China". 
The process of Electoral College voting consists of the selection of the electors (the people who actually get to decide on the vote casted.) Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution the District of Columbia is treated like a state, and is "allocated 3 electors" for the purpose of voting 
This would mainly be the ones who did not do community service in the first place. In this scenario, there would be no point in making community service mandatory at all. I can pretty much guarantee that the ones who didn't do community service in the first place would not do it anyway. Besides, some students already help the community without calling it "community service". Some students do nice things for people but don't consider that community service. 
Example why you shouldn't use your phone. First thing first you can cause an accident. 
there can be many different thoughts. Someone may suggest a better idea to you than others, 
Do you want to exclude students and make them feel like they're not good enough to participate in sports? Do you want to deprive us from healthy exercise and confidence? Please consider the consequences of keeping this new rule. I feel it is unfair and I strongly disagree with it. I don't want anyone to feel left out or worthless when it comes to sports, but do you? 
Even so, that was the first time since 1888, as said in paragraph 16. 
The planet surface temperatures is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what our own planet. The percent of carbon dioxide is 97 percent. People study about venus, how is and how hot it is and if there is people/animals living there, but they know it's not easy conditions but servivable for humans 
The cars so far still need a driver for some of the things. The car can do the steering. That sounds easier than it is. It is realiy hard, it just take some time. Driverless cars are possible. The cars so far still need a driver for some of the things. The car can do the breaking. That is sounds easier than it is. It is realiy hard. 
Certain people still say that "it's aliens, aliens are making these faces!" 
Although the video conferencing software might include a messaging system for students to communicate with their teachers, 
Using this type of technology can be somewhat unsafe to students in classrooms, beacsue what if they aren't happy and someone uses the Facial Action Coding System, but then reveals how the person really feels. 
Texting and driving needs to stop now before more people get hurt. 
Even though Venus has harsh conditions that humans are not able to survive on, there are still technological avdvances that could lead us to exploring or living on the planet. Most scientists are curious of new things even if they can not physically study it in which the, "Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." such as Venus. The conditions of Venus will not stop scientists or researchers from trying to gather more and more information of Venus. The study of Venus could be an oppertunity to a whole new world. There are ways and technological ways that will allow humans to live on Venus but it just has not been discovered yet. 
I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. 
Other's say that students will not benefit by taking classes from online or video conferencing. 
What i mean to the closes is Venus could possible be another earth because it has the same features and it may well once have been the most earth - like plantet in our solar system, and in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too.Earth is closes to venus and mars but orbit the sun at different speeds means sometimes we are closer to mar and sometime venus. 
Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lip to show anger. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. They would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc.Computers know when your happy or sad if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. Most human communication is nonverbal inculding emotional communication so computers need to know that to. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. A computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.According to the facial feedback theory of Emotion moving your facial emotions, but also may even help produce them. Putting on a happy face actually works a renowned drama coach had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions. 
Some students may have different circumstances in which they are not able to go to school everyday, but distance learning could help them get the education they need despite these circumstances 
And lastly the final reson on why we shouldn't end the venus exploration is that the heat the planet has. 
Citizens votes should be the votes counted for electing presidents and not couted for electing electors 
A reason Venus is a dangerous place is the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. 
The purpose of the work over breaks is understandable, to ensure that we do not lose our knowledge and keep our brain working so when we go back to work it would be easier to get into learning and working as soon as possible. 
for example Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percsnt purality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral college (301 out 370). These is a reason why people right need to count more the the state. 
You can see that aliens didnt make it because when they took the picture in 1998 you couldnt really see the face, but in 2001 you could see it 3 times better than the first one. When taking pictures you always have to get the right angle because either something gets left out or something dosent shows up. 
For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, "Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote." Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, "The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism. 
Thirdly, students would have a more flexible schedule that would allow them to account for new job opportunities and volunteering hours. 
Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legilature nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.              
Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities 
I will and in from he section it says from television this idea was brought up. If it is from that television is not always right. Especially when it comes to safety. Safety is nouthing to play around with or to toy with. It is a prevention of lot lives and or injeries. 
If given the option to attend classes from home, more students would stay home and get the rest that they need in order to be healthy, because they would have an opportunity to stay on top of school, and not fall behind the rest of their class. 
I think we can keep it, But improve it. 
Driverless cars are a great idea but the dangers and other factors have not been depated yet. 
Even though people have "spotted" alien UFO's, they have no proof. 
Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. 
because thats like saying our land forms were made by aliens and thats why we have mountains, valleys, and plains. 
Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to learn in a way which interests them and express their ideas without limitations and pressure by a teacher, on the other hand, teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them. Having the right balance is very important and this balance can be obtained by students designing their own projects in the summer and teachers guiding students during the school year. This method will result in individuality development and the teachers can lead the students on the right path throughout the school year.  
it promotes the alternative transportation and reduce smog. 
Technology is a major factor in our world today as it has both positives and negatives. It has also brought major change into the education system as now students may have an option to learn online instead of the traditional classroom. While online learning is new to education, it has also brought up the argument about whether it's more or less beneficial than regular school. Unfortunately, common problems arise with online learning that effect the young and future generations of our society. Taking classes from home may allow students to work at their own pace, but due to distractions at home and the decrease of social interaction, home schooling is less beneficial than going to regular school.  
It was a cloudless day in Cyndonia. "The team had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view." Garvin said. Not easy work. The article also mentions that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photos. I think that this picture did really prove that the Face was only a landform and not some kind of martian marking. 
A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics belive that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilazation. In 1976, when NASA's Viking 1 crossed over a landform that showed "shadowy likeness" of a human face. When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar. 
I think this could be a life changing oppotunity for people. This is a awesome thing to do because it is not an everyday thing for most people to be apart of. 
Due to the elctoral college system, voters vote not for the president but just for the slate of electors, who then turn elect the president. 
Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. 
The technology is good for in some reason but reading faces too easy for human and humans doens't need a computer to tell hom the other person is feeling becuase humans can read faces too. their is no reason that human need a computer to tell them when ever a person is sad or happy. Humans can just look at their faces just to see of they are happy or sad. 
This articke shows me that driverless cars are an bad idea. Too much money, more modificatio, and crashes are only a little bit of the priorieties that need to be ficed with driverless cars. When these get fixed then driverless cars may be a better idea, but until then they need to try to fix these issues.  
i would really perfume we do have our cells phone in school. and i am not just saying this b. cause i am a teenage and i am a student in SCHOOL_NAME 
While a student cannot be in a physical building all the time, they have access to the internet at all hours of the day, putting unneeded stress on some students. 
I almost slid off the boat in the middle of the night.your also going to be in the ocean for hours until you reach your destination. 
Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can "indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. 
Source 1: "What is electoral College?" explains that "each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors." Many people do not know what that really means. It means that the people of the United States do not actually vote for who their president will be. They are voting for someone who gets to choose who the president will be. Having the Electoral College is very confusing 
the students can be prepared fully on what they are going to learn for the upcoming school year, 
If it must be described as "emissions ... are choking cities" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with pre-existing respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task-oriented location that many go to with the aid of a car. 
Changing the election to a vote of popularity is a great idea in my opinion. 
This article is abaut the platent of venus that are sometimes called Evening Star this is the secon planet from our sun,this planet is one that tje people can see from a large distance it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. this is the most dangerous for the people because the sun is like the fire the people can`t see and touch this in a short distance the sun and they light can be beautiful but is it most thing that is dangerous in the universe. 
reduce the pollution. 
Many students move to different places throughout their learning career, making it difficult for them to adapt to their new situations. It is tiresome for many to adjust to new circumstances that could vary drastically depending on where the move takes place. For instance, students that have parents in the military may face moving to different countries in their adolescence. It could also be very difficult for students that move internationally to understand the language or cultural differences that they are surrounded by 
Students can get involved in their community in countless ways weather its piking up trash or reading books to a small child, there are only 3 steps to community service... 
This machine created by Dr. Huang and his colleague prof. Nicu Sebe can impact students in ways that are good or bad. For some people it can be a good thing but for others it can mean a bad thing. 
Some people might say that some extracurricular activities, like sports, can cause injuries 
and if they don't do it there should be a punishment like lunch detention or something of that sort. 
It is unacceptable because sports or other activities besides academics are valuable to students. 
This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach. 
Replacing the electoral college with popular votes would be better for elections of presidents because, it's the peoples choice. 
You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive. So, unless your like tickets, fines, jail time, or losing your driver's license, I suggest you wait till you get home to check you phone. 
Stop using your cell phones while the car is on drive. Think about the people who are walking around you and driving around you. What if there's a baby in the car? Let's say you get in an accident you just hit someone's family think about what if that was your family who just got injured because you decided to pull out your phone, because you got distracted liking someone's new Instagram post, because you just had to take a selfie for snapchat. All of that could have waited till you got to your destination. Stop letting these little things get to you. Now think about it was pulling your phone really worth it now you just hurt not only the family but yourself, your car is all distorted. 
but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class. 
For most students, summer means the beginning of a much needed months-long break from school. For some, however, the stress of school never fades away. Some schools require that students complete assigned summer projects in order to continue learning, even when not in school. The importance of continued education is rarely argued, but the way some projects are planned out might not always result in engagement and time investment from the student. 
Students should help out where help is needed the most like homeless shelters or cleaning up trash around town. 
A big counterargument against public schooling is that the mix of different learning styles could create a confusing learning environment. 
but, thats not logical. 
I think that it will be reasonable if you don't let students play sports if they have a F or a D because that isn't a passing grade so they wont have 2 things to worry about at once because they will only be focusing on school only. 
Reason for my opinion is that alot of times the electoral college has too much say, and we the people dont have enough say 
Students would benefit to a great extent if they could take classes online 
The scientist thinks that the face was madeby aliens but I think it wasn't that it's just a natural landform. 
. If we make a vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our canditate electors , very important. 
Other people do not need to know what is wrong with you, rather you are upset, sad, angry or happy. 
protection 
We can fine the reason for students take the classes online 
. People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say "well, I only her/him for them because he/she looked as if he/she could change things." Just because he/she LOOKS like they could change something, doesn't mean its going too happen. That's where the saying "don't judge a book by its cover" comes in. 
I believe this would be easy but a little more difficult to plan the picking up trash because the students will need to leave and come back from the homes of the elderly at different times so most if not all of the elderly citizens of our community can be helped and cared by the students at SCHOOL_NAME.In a result there would be less fatalities of the elderly by falling because of the students with them to help care for them. 
It would take time for parents to be taught how to properly teach to their children, and even if they can, they may not have the time to. Further more, most parents work at the same time school is in session; parents should not be depended on to home school every day and every week. Even if a parent can stay at home, they would most likely have the more important matters of completing chores, such as cleaning and cooking, for the family. 
Finally, a common problem found in adults is an inability to separate home and work life; this begins at a young age when children fail to make the clear distinction between home and school. 
These summer projects should be student-designed 
The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face. 
"Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars." (paragraph 6) 
The electoral college election consist of the 538 electors. All you have to do is win most of those votes and you win the election. It is pretty unfair for the rest of the people that are votting for presidential election. 
If everyone did community service than the school would look nice and the teachers would be more organized. 
When using the Electoral College you have an exact percentage of the outcome of the votes, no guessing or estamating. The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducucing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met. 
the more kids play sport the least likely kids will be leaving school fat. 
Wouldn't it be great to be able to drive to places without anyone actually driving? I think that would be fantastic! Today, I am going to talk about driverless cars. 
Staying after school for clubs could get kids off of there phones, and help them to stay active. 
students receive a real world experience, 
they can also lake classes on what there are going to be on the future it`s would be a great aportunity to learnd bout it . 
When practice starts we would have to be doing service and coaches would become very angry as well as the students because of missed practices. If we have test the next day at school and we have to do well on it to pass the class we might not be able to because we were being forced to do service.Just because of you we would fail our classes and our sports. 
Sure over 60 percent of votes would prefer a direct electionto the type of elction that we have now 
whereas we already use the popular vote today as a way of forecasting the oucome and seeing the people's real choice. 
Most students stress about homework, work at school , grades ,sports ,etc. , if they are obligated to provide community service then that would be just another thing to stress about , and i am sure nor you or the parents want to see a stressed or depressed child. 
Using cell phones between class allows students to communicate with their friends even if they are across the school. It also allows them to contact their family if it is necessary. 
Some of the smaller states that don't count for much of the vote or tend to lean towards a different party don't even get a visit from the canidates. Not only is that unfair but it's also completly demaning towards the state. It makes the citizens of the state feel unworthy or not important enough for not even making an effort for their vote. This is also a stupid move on the canidates part because they might have been able to persuade the state's vote. 
we consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electtors. 
the fact that having other people explain other sides of arguments can help you come to a better conclusion of what to do. 
but the decesion on the president is going to mostly affect us, the people. 
if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" 
Seeing you in the miriror each they its like you are trying to see something diffirent that you can see becuse alreddy has the face that you have to see even tho they are not in the same expression ecah day becuse some times your actitud your face your simile arte the ones that can change with aout let you know each day you will hav a expressions that will change your face 
If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing. 
Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling. 
Why cant people just vote normally, why is there even an electoral college, why do they make us vote even if there's gonna be an electoral collegeor popular vote which is gonna decide for us. 
Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. 
The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise Between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote. 
The electoral college is is unfair,outdated, and irrational in the united states. Most say the electoral college is good because its keeps favortizm away but it really just adds it to the election. The direct election is way more simple and easy to find out who wins. I send you this letter to see if you would think about taking it out, but i know you probably won't see this. 
The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidental elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting. The Electoral College is best off forgotten as a voting system.    
For example, it's said clearly in the article that for first time in the story of U.S.A there's 2 represents to be president that came from the state of Hawaii in 1960, and those represent was against Jhon F. Kennedy. Or the other case that the Electoral system in those times it was very confused and for each state it represents 1 vote so The legendary John Kerry wins 34 democratics votes. There was alot of controversy. 
For example, there are almost 900 students in my school, This would mean in the 10 after school activities my school provides, there would need to be 90 kids in each one; That's enough to fill 4 classrooms. This brings up another problem, the school can't have 150 kids in one program and 10 in the other, so the school would have to chose the activity for us. Just that fact alone takes all the excitement out of the activity, just for reference, imagine the star quarter back on the football ending up in art instead, possibly destroying his or her whole football career. Most of my school's after school activities need certain spaces for the participants to practice and do their activity. For instance the robotics team only has one room with all of the vices, saws, and tools while the other robotics rooms will have students constantly running between the other rooms getting tools that they dont have in their completely different room. The cheer leading team will have to move to the gym to fit all the people, but so did the pep band, and basketball practice is already in the gym, but they could just go in the auxiliary gym which is smaller than the cafeteria, the problem with that is the wrestling team is already in the auxiliary gym. The school has no room to fit every team and all of the clubs. 
You get to travel on seas! 
t simplifies the outcome 
In 1976 a tie would have occured if a merge of 5,559 voters from ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii voted the other way 
When they see all the amazing sights: caring for the animals and, how they are making new friends, and caring for others. 
Students could join a extracurricular activity to make new friends. 
In traditional science classes, for example, students participate in laboratory investigations regarding pertinent aspects of their studies. Through such activities, students are allowed to apply their knowledge and reasoning skills to create memorable understandings of the investigated topics.Online schools, however, cannot offer such activities, confining students to less involved and therefore less effective means of learning. Without interactive activities, students of online schools would not be able to obtain enduring understandings of learned concepts, ultimately limiting their educational horizons. 
The people in out states have a big use in voting. without the people then whats the use in being in states why not just one big land. Every state has its own way of voting but the peoples votes really dont mean anything with the electoral college. The electoral college just take over voting and wont let the people oppinions work in voting. Without them our votes will mean something, not just thrown away and just be forgotten. 
having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all. 
Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are. 
I would argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states and not keeping the ellectoral college. 
In this artical the auther explains why exploring Venus is a good idea 
so that it assures the student wants to do the project, 
So that kinda makes people think that NASA is lying about the "Face" being a natural landmark. The Government and NASA are keeping secrets in Area 51. So they must be keeping this whole "Face" thing secret too. That it's not a butte or a mesa. But that it was created by life on Mars. 
First the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. 
Mission controllers checked twice to make sure it wasn't created by aliens 
If you ask for advice and it doesnt solve the problem you have to ask more people and tell the first person there advice didnt help. 
Year book gives students a chance to interact with other students by giving new students a chance to make friends, and it helps them find other students they can relate to. 
"Long ago, venus was probaly coverd in large oceans and could have supported varouis forms of life, just like earth today". The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height. Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth. 
faster to calculate 
Although it is good to have multiple opinions your not always going to get a straight answer. 
The Electoral College should be kept in use 
Have you ever found yourself being bored when doing a project? Have you found it pointless because you get the horrible feeling that you are not learning? It could be because it was designed by your teacher. Many schools, but not all, require students to complete summer projects in order to get them ready for the upcoming information in those upcoming classes. Many of those projects are teacher designed which various students tend to dislike because of the singular, required format. For example, many projects require students to only draw pictures, only write essays, or only build structures related to the certain topic. Many of these students tend to lack the motivation to complete those tasks because they feel uncomfortable doing an action they are inexperienced with. 
being more active 
if they didn't have a club that they wanted to join, and maybe they would enjoy that club. 
Community service will also give them a sense of accomplishment and more responsibility, 
our founding fathers put that in the constitution 
They can organize it so it's spread out or split up into parts at a time so they don't put much pressure on the student who could feel overwhelmed by all the work they have to complete in a short amount of time. Especially if the student waits until the last minute to complete their summer assignment because they thought the assignment was really long and time consuming. 
Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star," is one of the brightest points of the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the second planet from our sun. The nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. 
This computer can know is you happy or sad. If they play video game you fell happy so thee computer know that too 
The winner-takes-all method is as literal as it sounds; the winner takes all. For example if someone was running for president and they got 301 votes and 370 electoral college votes, they would win (you only need a majority of 270 votes to be elected. 
Another thing could be what of the technology making this possible is wrong, so you walk up to a student and ask them why they're so happy but they are actually really sad. 
For example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. 
Thats not you can do or see being a seagoing cowboy you can go to other places like greece 
When people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. 
the student wouldn't have enough sleeping time 
The canditates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, he/she already has 20% of the vote in his/her pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting canditates "they" think is best, not voting the canditates their state thinks is best. 
In conclusion Senate, Citizens of this country and I believe that we should put an end to the electoral college. Politicians even disagree with the idea of giving specific people to give the final vote. As senator you have the power to put a end to this unconstitutional doing. The United States is a democracy where everyone matters. Because of the electoral college our opinion on who should be elected has been taking away from us. this event is undemocratic and I ask you senator to think this through and take action on making this voting system to a popular voting system 
f nature is killed by our littering that means we are losing ways to find cures for diseases 
Students have a lot on their plates between school, homework, and studying, sometimes it's good to take a break 
the foundin fathers establish it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens."  in which that if we been doing this for century the people votes never really mattered because voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. well i didnt know people need some  for some one to turn back around and they deside who they want to vote for. 
This technology is not important to what is going on to in the class room or in todays world. 
health classes effect how much your emotions affect your body for example if you're always depressed you'll have a chance that your body might suffer from something and you might have a hard time to bring your body to stay strong again after suffering from depression and if your always happy you won't have a problem. 
When doing home bound, you get assigned to a teacher and they pick up your work for you and come to your home or where ever else yall wanna meet and do the work together in case the student has any questions. 
but in my prespective I believe that you can't just go and and discover that and it all be fake it's not happening and it never like that 
Either one is wrong nor right. If I were to see it myself then I would say it looks like an alien's face. If there was some type of other evdience then thats when we know what it is. One clue isnt gonna help as much, unless we were to have more edvidence/ clues 
Students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home 
The Electoral College selects the electors, so the canadates are gonna choose the electors that have things in common with them so they win the election. Voters vote for a slate of electors, they dont get to vote for President. 
"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favo of itare mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections ae spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dle was right: Abolish the electoral college!" 
seeking multiple opinions when seeking for advice can help make a better choice. I agree with this statement 
As the modern world advances in technology and media, schools need to advance with it. An outdated education system leaves little room for student growth and success; it can damper the effects of the hard work that both teachers and students put into school. However, this waste of efforts can be easily avoided by means of the updating of school policies. For example, it is growing increasingly more common for schools to offer distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to engage in online classes and video conferencing as a way of learning from home. Therefore, students would be able to attend classes virtually from their own homes. 
It will help you on your leader ship skills the most 
the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday. 
If something terrible were to happen to a students family, they should be able to contact the student immediately. How could they do so without a cell phone? This also true if it were backwards, and there was an emergency at school. If something were to happen that left the school's administration physically unable to hell the students, how could students get help? With cell phones, they would be able to contact their families and emergency medical services. 
but because of it's "thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide" or blazin temperatures no space craft or human are able to last on the planet without getting crushed or burned to crisps. Venus atmosperic pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans and living things experience on earth making it impossible for someone to last on the planet, with all of its cons many would rather admire from a view but some would rather get closer. 
The question was should we keep the Electoral college or we should stick to voting for president. 
There's no doubt that this is just some random structure because there were no oxygen, nor water, on mars, in 1976 
In conclusion, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and there for the case of the Face on Mars was a natural monument after all. It compared to West America for all of the weird thing that they have. 
but it can also relieve stress and anxiety, which is a major component of a decision about to be made 
they talk about people and spreads it around. 
For some students, sitting in class for eight hours straight with little time between classes is grueling, and yet others have no trouble focusing for the whole day. Online learning could let learn at their own pace, wether it be taking breaks throughout the day, or completing all of their work in one sitting. Online learning would also prevent the spread of certain diseases, because students are no longer crouded in the same building together. 
people are happier without cars 
I agree you should keep the Electoral College because it a has a major impact who gets elected 
If you talk to more people, you trust them and yourself even more. You know what you're up against and you know what will come out of it. 
because, it says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomine confused or bores" in the text. While looking in a mirror, you see your own reflection of yourself because, it says "Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth bacause, technology can't do that. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling ("crow's-feet") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes" in the text. 
I believe all students must do tasks to assist the community. Students should participate in helping the community 
The Electoral College assures that the President isnt just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country.  Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States. 
One of the brightest points of light in the night sky is the "Evening Star' which is also a close planet to us called Venus. Venus might seem harmless and pretty from a distance but when you get close it can be really dangerous. The conditions of Venus are hazardous to us. In fact we have had past missions that were never recorded becuase not a single mission succeded. However, NASA is trying to come up with technology that can survive these conditions so we can study Venus. 
Yes you will have a lot less people that end up doing it, but the people that do will be excited, motivated and ready to make a difference in the world one community at a time. 
In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. 
Whats the point of even putting in our vote if the Electoral College is gonna take over and vote for who they want. It makes no sense at all. 
distance learning provides the student with an enhanced ability to pursue self-education. 
In my opinion it'll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you"'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. We humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face. 
A village have a school and they are diside learning the people, they offer for distance learning. They do meeting for that and everybody agree for that. After few week start the class. Some students visit every where and they try to teach to viliage peoples and attend to them. They think village peoples learning everything . What they are need? 
These projects that get assign should be more student-designed 
Using new techonology it can help student in calss to undersstand how world is bringing new things that can help millinons of people to recognize their emotions. 
Movements take place to improve what seems to be a problem. It is obvious that the over usage of cars is a problematic case. 
But if you are going to install this rule, there must be some limits. 
also when someone has worries about something. 
keeps you closer to the people around you. 
I think if all students have to do community service, it will make it a better community, and people will be more involved 
Honestly sir/ma'm i think that it would be way better if we just changed our election on popular vote instead of having it as an electoral college. 
Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars 
I am very imform about this and making a change will only make thinks worse. People are not going to get use to doing another way or they are gonna get confuse with the old one. It going to be a caus if you change it. 
Even Knowing that nasa wishes there was ancient people living on mars doesnt mean there actually is. 
5. Avoid Run-Off Elections: 
The face on Mars is a natural landform 
but how will you be able to get to work faster if your job is many miles away? It surely will tire you out by then. 
The reason why we should not abolish The Electoral College is that every state counts as a vote. One example is that Florida has 29 electoral votes, but big states with less people has a lowerer electoral vote. 
it helps kids learn to help out other people besides your self and some kids can really learn from just helping a couple of people out. But its up to you there are some positives and negatives with this choice. 
In 2013 they said that they put a ''Traffic Jam Assistant'' on a 2013 BMW.It can drive its self with the help sometimes of a human touch if in any trouble.Manufactures sais that they will have a camera in a car and will watch the person as the person watches the road. Manufactures are also bring a system to where if the human needs to drive then they can turn off the system and they can start to drive without it. 
it was stated that "Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference...". In defense to the Electoral College, people who were to vote are the same people who wants to express how they feel about one thing. The people who vote might feel so strongly about political situation than others. 
Maybe if a student had the permission to use their phone in school from their parent. The teachers don't allow it but their guardian does. I think the issue should be resolved by parents and not by a student. 
Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"that we avoid run-off elections. "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...."The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner. 
Each candidate had his or her group of electors. Mostly the political party like Democratic and Republican. he Electoral college is the established Constitution as a compromise between electionof the presdident by vote in congress. Popular votes for the election of the president is more meaningful then having 538 electors and 270 electoral votes. I think the electoral college doesn't work. 
People that don't help out don't get far in life . Life isn't just about what you want or need . Some people don't get anything they want because they are busy helping others . If people help out the community it would be much cleaner and safe for other children . If there was a park that was dirty and we had some older kids from school help clean it up , it would be a lot safer for those younger children 
The conflict of whether or not scientists should study the planet Venus has been up in the air, no pun intended, for sometime now. Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made. 
One time my aunt went to a park because of an oil spill and she helped out with cleaning the damage. While she was there someone who knew a lot about wild life taught her about the different species. Later in life we went for a walk and on the streets we saw a snake that looked like a very poisonous one, but my aunt with her new knowledge of wildlife knew exactly what it was. Good thing she went to that park for community service and learned about different animals. 
When I first started playing Mortal Kombat 11. I was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do. I told myself I want to try and use different characters than the ones I use constantly. So I do so and realize that I never really play with Generic_Name or Generic_Name for some reason but then when I tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out. So I had convinced myself that it was all because I never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as Mortal Kombat X and I am not really good at working with close ranged fighters. My specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance. Zoners were my best bet at winning any match. Also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job. 
For example you can choose where and when to learn in your home with no distraction at all. But in school the options are scares. When a student is surrounded by a lot of other students and staff the drive to stay focus can be limited. There also could be students who stop classes from learning by being very distracting tends to being at home with no distraction at all. 
In addition, the new entertainment systems in a car may be a new and alien experiance, they point to a rough road ahead. 
Over seventeen sates did not see the candidates at all,Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. When you vote for a presidental candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 
After determining which states they "have in the bag", the candidates are going to put their campaigning efforts toward the "toss-up" or "swing states". Here they will have to compete in a tight race between the other party to sway the voters of the state to vote their way. This method of campaigning in the swing states doesn't allow for much campaining in the big, numerous votes states. An example of this would be that during the 2000 campaign, almost 20 states did not see the candidates at all as well as campaign ads. With the Electoral College system in place, Presidential candidates are focusing more on obatianing the "swing state" votes and not so much on supporting and visiting the states and people they know they have. 
This shows the dangers Venus has and the if it worthly to discovered 
The process of the Electoral College provides an even political balance throughout a nation, 
could be really exspensive, 
It happened 25 years ago. You can say its from aliens but it is not an alien! Iv'e seen pictures of Face. From reshearch only robots walked on Mars. Aliens are not even real. There are camras om thoes robots so they would know if they seen anything. Have you ever got a warning that an alien invation was about to occur? 
we can saty safe at home. 
Even though it helps the community out by making it a cleaner and safer place the students should have a choice in what they want to do for their community. 
I think that students wouldn't really benefit from taking classes from home 
There's a lot to be said about the Electoral College... Both good and bad, but in the end there isn't much anyone who is normal and whose vote barely counts for anything can do.  We can say how bad it is however much we want.  We can throw at you facts upon facts about how unnecessary or unfair the Electoral College is.  In the end, it's up to the government to decide what will happen, as it always has been. 
Summer projects should be designed by teachers 
Service helps you feel good inside and have better self esteem and may also help you physically. 
You would think it would just be you, the people, but theres actually other people that vote too, called the Electoral college. You help choose your states electors when you vote for your President 
If it was after school it could take time away from the students doing their homework, 
So Today some School give you the option to teach you from School. 
Modern humans today are always on their phone. They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop .All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media. They even do it while driving. 
In that work we gonna explain, give ideas and talk a little bit about the problems at the study of Venus because that planet is very dangers to survival 
Teachers dont assign the summer work to be evil toward you, they do it because they want you to be successful in the new school year. They want to set you up for success not failure. 
I think that we should get rid of the eletoral collage and switch to a popular vote system 
The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago. No one knows how it was made but it was located in Cydonia on Mars. 
I believe talking to more then one person is the best thing you can do if you need advice. Although it can be difficult to talk to people for advice, I believe that it can help you deeply. And now here are some reasons why you should talk to one or more people if you need advice. 
Getting opinions from multiple people can greatly impact your decision. 
Asking for advice is a crucial part of making a big decision. Many people ask for second opinions when they don't know what they should do, or can't decide on their own. 
In paragraph 3, it says, "such environment would crush even a submarine...and would liquefy many metals." This shows that they know that what type of metals they need to use. 
Many high school and college classes have leaned greatly towards using technology for student's to complete and turn in assignments. Nowadays, teachers and professors are mostly used for lecturing which can easily be transmitted online. Therefore, as the years progress, and technology grows to be more influential on society, schools should consider taking advantage of technology to ensure a better educational system for every type of student.   
I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
but they should still make some time to volunteer, even if its not huge, they could collect food for a food bank or something small 
Another reason that I think that we can just uses our brain and eyes for find out there emotion or just tell them which is better that using a computer to figure that out 
If we have to contact our parents to let them know that we are going to be gone and miss the bus, because of school activity then we have to let them know. 
First off, it's important to acknowledge that accidents happen on the open road every day, with the primary cause being mistakes that drivers make. Therefore, manual vechicles are not necessairily dangerous, but are not as reliable as an automatic vehicle. Think about other practical additions that help consumers, such as a lifeguard on a beach. If they weren't there, would we be as safe? Probably not. Therefore, if the addition of driverless cars ensures that a safer option is available, then it only makes sense that the advantage should be taken. 
People should have their right to vote for who they think is best. That is why people are given the right to vote. The Electoral College just takes that right away. Presidents who win because of electoral votes, are not fairly chosen because, not many voters agreed on him, the electors did. The candidate that won popular votes, should be President, because most people agree on him and his choices. Let the people's votes count toward presidency. 
There was a study done at Workman State College where scientist studied students who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied students who actually went to school for the whole day. Both groups of students were learning the same material, the group at home got a video of their teacher explaining everything exactly the same as what she taught in class. Half of students at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home, meanwhile, the students at school had many conversations with other peers and teachers. Throughout the day, the students who stayed at home lost 10% of there overall social communication skills and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that was being taught by their teacher. This study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lessons like peer project and even just normal conversations that are experiences that can strengthen you socially for the future. 
I feel that students should have to do community service. 
you sometimes get free time 
Everyone can make a grade B average, so this policy would not be unfair. It would challenge the students to do there best on every paper they turn in. The students would also learn new study skills, as well as fundamental organization skills that are needed in everyday life. If students could keep up with all their school stuff, study good, and keep good grades, then collage will be easier when it comes their time. It's proven that students that make the better grades do better in college and other activities, then the ones that make less decent grades. 
Systems like this have the chance to not be right. Make believe what this system is all about. 
Pursuing and expanding our knowledge of venus is beneficial in many ways and can be safely done. 
To wrap it up, the electoral college do have pros and cons in a election. The electoral college can give a candidate the election. But the popularity vote are for the people and by the people. I stiil stay towards to the idea that the popularity vote is a greater way for voting. Remember it does say We The People in the Declaration of Independence which was sighn by our founding fathes.    
it unfair that the grow ups can but not us they need to do theirs job then if we need to do ours job and i hope you think about that to see us feel about it. 
Also the Author says that the Facial Action Coding System computers can Deteced when you are happy or when you are sad.In Paragraph 4 it says that each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. Also it says that it can scan movements in a real face or in the the painted face of Mona Lisa. Plus it can be used for a video as well that show a new emotion with the software. 
By allowing students to design their own projects instead, each student can individually design their project in a way that is compatible with the existing summer plans. 
The Electoral College puts most of the weight on the large states because of their large populations. 
With all that being said, why would we want to go back there. 
In the real world, future adults will have contact with a lot of people and students who had an interaction with other students will have an easier time doing so in their adult life. Unlike kids who spent their time in a room all by themselves learning, they will have to adapt to having interactions with other people. For example if a student who took the online classes in a future job had to present something for his boss, the student would have a difficult time getting his point across to other people because of the missing interaction with other people during their developmental years. Now if a student who attended school with other people did this it would be much easier for them because they would know how to talk to others and get their point across. 
including aiding students in maintaining their health 
So yes, its valuable. 
High schoolers are very busy people who rather not spend a portion of their summer completing school work. With the help of their teachers, having the teacher-designed summer assignment, students will have the motivation to work and complete what is being asked of them. Going into a new school year, students could never imagine what may occur or what teacher they may get. It could be an easier course but with a difficult teacher, or a challenging course with a relaxed teacher. Having these teacher-designed assignments, will provide knowledge to the students that they may need for the upcoming class. It will give them a peek as to what they may expect while enrolled. This is important because most students base their course selections off of what their friends are taking, rather than what they are more interested in. These students may have no idea what the course is about, so it's beneficial to have the teachers create the necessary work. Saying this, with the expectations held by teachers, it's only fair for students to be prepared. Assigning this type of work, will help take a leading hand in the successes waiting for these curios students. 
First in paragraph one and three, The region where the face was found is called Cydonia and 
because it makes more sense and is easier for you guys to count the votes 
i disagree that all students should have at least one extracurricular activity 
The good things are that it mite get some kids grades up and push them to do it to play sports 
We cattle boat sailers don't give up we are resilient. I bet you are resilient to so sign up. You get to travel get to see some places you never seen before. Sometimes you might even go on a avanture. If you dont believe me you can scrutinize this sign up sheet. The ocean wheather can get surreal but we cattle boat sailers dont give up! You get to see China you'll see Europe. While your traveling you get to haul horses and cattle. The horses will have enough food to last for the trip the record for the most trips is nine trips aint that crazy. Well if you sign up today you might be the one to beat that record so get started by signing up right now for free today. 
Like people may think yes , electoral college should stay and should not be changed to popular vote in electing the president 
Do i think that using technology to read emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valable you may ask, 
this letter is simply a right this country has given me as a citizen-freedom of speech. My defense is equality, and shouldn't be ignored sometimes a pedrigree like the electoral vote needs to change. 
in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily 
venus is one of the most challenging exploring planet on the slolar system.if we can find a way to overcome this challenges we should be able to over come all other planet on the solar system challegings this we dont have to worry about this earth twin to affect our own earth. 
I think we should have a club in doing community service. Some of the students think it is a wonderful idea and some think it's a waste of there time. 
Inconclusion I still don't believe in aliens, but something had to happen to Mars. It could of been a natural landform or it could of been a spacecraft flying around Mars. They world may never know how the face was created, but I'm positive that aliens didn't create it. 
Some children for example need tutoring in certain subjects that you may be able to help with. Another example is cleaning up litter in your local park or just on the streets outside your house. Elderly people can get lonely sometimes and a great way of community service would be to write them letters for the holidays and bring them happiness. If you are interested in arts and crafts you can get together with friends and make artwork for sick children in hospitals. Other people love snow. If you're one of those people who love the snow, you can shovel your neighbors driveways next time it snows. The thing is that if they offer you money, you cannot accept it, you must kindly say no or then it would not be community service. 
The consequences that cars toll people with today are greatly weighing on an individuals daily life. They have their schedule built around their car and are constantly being time constrained because of it. The effect greenhouse gases have on the Earth is huge and has not stopped. In order to help the Earth in this parituclar topic, this action would be miraculous. Not only do many people become lazy and very unhealthy because of cars, but they also take for granted what they can do without them. Hiking and other activities are missed out on the daily because of these vehicles. Many people can accomplish new goals and set new goals if it were not for certain transportation methods.                             
In situations like these, the school should help provide the student with the appropriate equipment and better their education. 
The photo actually showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. 
Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do. 
Overall the electoral college is completely unfair with so many different problems that over rule the right of ther people. 
When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home. 
As long as we get to use them when we have free it would be ok for them 
If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day. 
using what they know about Venus 
We see our faces everyday, so its easy to compare. In the top picture you can see a land formation, but scince we know what a face looks like its easy to compare to. In the picture, yes we can see some definition but its still just a land form. For example the man in the moon, it looked like a face but wasn't. 
For the people that struggle with work and grades and all they get are C' s then they won't be able to do sports, and if you change the school's policy now they that might jeopardise other people that wanted to join sports from playing those sports and people that have worked their butt off to do these sports that now can't play because of their grades will mean that they did all that hard work for nothing, and that they will have to do something else that will suite them 
The text states that states like, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have limited use of semi-autonomous cars due to safety issues. A big concern is if you get into a car accident with a driverless car, who is there to blame?In order for driverless cars to be used they would have to set in liability law changes and who would be be blamed for the accident, as it states in the text. 
In my opinion people shouldn't not be texting while driving because it only takes a simple mistake, and someone could get hurt. 
Because one person might have better advice than some other person they asked if they asked multiple people for advice 
Different people have different viewpoints and opinions. If you only seek advice from one person, you only see one side of what could happen, rather when you ask multiple sources, you're given a greater sense of what to do and how to go about it. 
For the kids that work well under pressure, or have the capability to handle the challenges they face, the change in the schools priorities for the students probably won't affect them as much. Although only one extracurricular activity would be required, not all students could be able to wisely manage their time to fit the activity in their schedule. Also, maybe not all students would be able to find something they enjoy with the options given at their school. 
So those aere the reasons that i would want a use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom that is valuable. 
You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates's electors." 
"Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original Vikings photos. 
Many kids who are bored tend to get caught up in bad things , such as gangs, drugs, and violence. 
Many of us students struggle in school, it's hard trying to keep grades up with also trying to keep a social life and any other problems that come our way. When the idea of school pops up into a students mind, it can be seen as annoying. When you have the privilage to do your work on your own time makes the student feel more calm and not worried about when a projects due or if they did their homework. Everyone is different some students may benefit from homeschooling or online school, and some may not, every student is going to learn differently. 
that's a students free time 
Lots of eventers createed a lot things based on there opinion on something. Thomas Edison belived that he could make a ball of light and what did he do he mad the light bulb and every single house in the world that uses electricity uses the light bulb,I even got one at my house. Bengimin Franklin wanted to find out what lightning was so he went outside with a kite and a and a key and he captured and it couldv'e killed him. But it did not instead of dieing he was the creater of elctrictity. How do you think you got to work today? Even public speakers have there own opinions how do you think African American children and American children are in the same school,becasue Martin Luther King Jr belived or felt as if that the shouldn't be segregated any longer. The thing is about that is that is was his opion and helt to need he needed to say what he thought to everybody now lookat the world. 
Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision. 
they know the material, 
It has been scientifically proven, that doing an activity outside of school has made students happier than the kids that sit around or barry themselves in piles of schoolwork. 
Venus Is a similler planet like Earth but only its density and size of the planet. 
and it all comes back to the voters. 
when your parents said that you could never have a pet when you were a kid and now that you moved out you decide to get a puppy. You have planned this moment forever but you do not know what kind of dog you want to get. Say you were living in an apartment and the only breed of dog you cannot have is a Pit Bull but thats okay because you've always wanted a German Shepherd. So you find puppies for sale and go look at them and decide to buy one. But you did not do research and now you are lost and do not know what to do. You decide to ask your mom and she said to make sure you walk the puppy and make sure it gets enough exercise because it is a big dog. Then when you go get a check-up for the puppy you ask the vet and they say to make sure the puppy gets enough food, exercise, and water. Of course you go with what the vet said and now your puppy is the best looking dog in the whole apartment building. 
will take it seriously, 
The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere. More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere. Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks. Having knowledge fo venus meney researcher are working on some simplifed electronice.The National Aeronautis and space Administration have a idea for sending humans with haveing bad condush. At Venus temperatures would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Stat frome the text researchers are working on innvations that would alloe our mechines to last longer enought to contribute meningfully to our knowedge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. 
The author describes "Making Mona Lisa Smile" and how a new technology called the Facial Action Cording System enables compures to identify human emotions. Because the author is trying to tell us how the technology can make us feel differents emotions. In this article we can find too many differents emotions that the Mona Lise had. And how the techonology can do it too. 
My response to that is..sometimes presidents want to be president because "they want to change everything in the United States like ..taxes..and health insurance. For example like Obama care he has change the health insurance and people dont like that. And 2016 theres going to be a new President in the United States.    
Teachers in these higher level classes spend a lot of time teaching material to students and never have enough days in the year to teach it all without cramming it down the throats of their pupils, thus creating the need for the summer assignment 
in germany people dont have cars like they do in america. in germans people have to have a big place to park there car like a large garage. but i it costs 40,000 dollars to buy the garage. so 70 percent of germany doesnt have a car.on monday motorists are told to leave there car at home or there is a 31 dollar fine. almost 4,000 drivers where fined one day.27 people had there car impounded because of ther reaction to the fine. cars have been baned for 3 years. only buses and taxies are permited for the day. there goal is to promote alternative transport. violators faced a 25 dollar fine.parks and sprots cneters have bloomed since they have scut traffic. presdient obama has ambitious goals to curb america. studdies show that fewer americans are buying cars and getting less licenses as  the years go by.in america as of april 2013 the number of miles driven was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995.new yorks new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing  bridge and tunnel tolls reflect the new priortiy.    
On my opinion the Electoral Vote should be changed in order for people to vote for the president they want. 
The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democractic in a modern sense.... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When tou vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 
With online schooling and video conferencing, students will be able to be educated despite the hundreds of miles between them and their original school. This option may even help students take baby steps to slowly adjust to their new environment. 
As long as you have the proper tools to let the students at this school have a chance to do community service I believe that several of them will take that opportunity 
The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. 
Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons 
In the end it would come down to your choice, will you affect people's lives greatly, or will you let our lives continue on like we are? 
not every kid is as smart as a B or better average grade some can only get a C- or better. 
To some kids sports is the best and most important part to them. They represent the school by playing to win and have fun. the school is fine the way it is so why make a change. Change is not always a good thing, it will just make everything harder and worse. You raising the grade just keeps the kids from doing what they love to do. they cant keep up with everything all at once. 
Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. 
less mistakes will be made. 
The reason we explore or visit other plants its because the human curioity will likely lead us to many other discovers 
It may help the community if students were required to do community service 
. if there gonna add a activity it should be for teachers to learn how to teach students 
seeking multiple opinions on a topic is always a good idea. Whether it's as simple as choosing an outfit, or as complicated as loosing a friend, theres always room for more advice. Receiving advice from many people is helpful in many ways and always works out better then getting advice from just one person. It can be hard to make decisions, but with others help it can be a lot more simple and your decision will probably end up being better than if you were to make it yourself. 
like we don't understand. 
Finally, missing a day in school can be extremely devastating to a student's grade. 
Second thing is they could take place in a yearbook club to rplace a related art or a sport! 
"Incredibly, they also spent less time watching the road, even when they were texting by voice." Stated in the Text Free is No Safer to use while driving. The Texas A&M Transportation institute studied people driving a closed course under three conditions: while texting by hand, while texting by voice, and by not texting at all. It seems as if texting by voice should be safer than looking at your phone, but studies show that texting by voice and by looking at your phone, the reaction time is still the same. 
number 5, "Avoid Run-Off Elections" which is what I used in the second paragraph as a claim. 
The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was. 
Others might also take online classes due to being sick and, not being able to go out without the help of someone so, a student will probably stay home and also get the help they need. 
I say that we keep the electoral college because it was the way that the founding fathers found out how to balance out how the peope should decide. 
After all those years I stopped, but I still remember the adventure. Most of all I remember it was a chance of a lifetime, all the trips we made, and all the fun we had. The trip was definintly worth it. 
Online learning may be easier than real school but in the end it leaves you at a disadvantage and unprepared for college and life as an adult. 
Car Usage is more in U.S. because of transports,jobs,moving from one place to other,etc. We should use the cars but carefully because it can occur an accidents. 
Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people. 
it is just a natural made landform. 
I think people need multiple choices, so they could get a better vision on a topic that they wanted to know about. 
this would give use amazing resalts. but a the cost of developing a computer that the last time these were largly used was in the 1940's wolud be a fotune and they left that out for they relly whant to go. 
Electrical cars are coming, and you won't want to miss it. 
Let's change the Electoral College by making it better for us and Congress. 
In the article it states that "we humans perform this same impressive "calculations" everyday" when actually you just sense it or study their face to see which emotion you can see through their eyes or facial expressions 
The picure showed better evidence that the theorist were wrong about an ancient cover up of anything 
Education is very important 
During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. 
When someone votes to me that's a good thing because we have went through all this freedom stuff and then were able to vote and no many people want to vote that's pretty ridiculous if u ask me that's a sign of freedom like I've said before and when we go through a lot just to get u this grant of freedom and people just throw it away that's a sign of disrespect. I know that me being young and not able to vote yet and probably not making any since at all is probably making who ever is reading this mad but i wasn't put here to be taken right back out at a young age i was put here to live a life that was chosen for me and when people who are to dumb to realize it don't vote or at least don't try makes me mad because their not seeing what there doing just going in there and putting what ever name down on a ballot is wrong but going in there knowing a little information and choosing the person you think would make a good leader is fine. 
car culture. 
Every person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. 
you can give them a high school credit and for the 7th grade you can just give them a good grade. 
The Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case. 
Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers have existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.                  
But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows. 
They just go to states where they will get votes, 
"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere." That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet." Those are some harsh conditions. 
I think that yes, our school should participate in community service such as picking up litter and helping out elders and elementary children. 
the air isn't being poluted as much 
Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School. 
The technology could also help improve the quality of students' learning because it can make sure students are not confused 
Like the 2000 fiasco which was one of the biggest election crisis of the century. 
People old and young have a thirst for knowledge students especially. Teachers may give students a project they know nothing about but the goal is for the student to keep learning while on break 
they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. 
It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College dosent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a canidate. 
The most ideal project is teacher-designed because a student will most likely not plan an assignment that is actually helpful or one that prepares them for the upcoming year. 
In conclusion, the summer projects that some schools require students to complete should be teacher-designed.First, Teachers should be able to create what they will be grading.Second, Teachers will also make sure that the projects are not just pointless busy work.And last but not least, It is the teachers job to educate student on unfamiliar subjects. 
Some also so it should be abloished and that it's unfair and very irrantional, 
Though there are numerous sensors surrounding the car and the driver is notified when they need to take control, there still isnt enough for a car to work on its own. Even if the car reached the technological point to ensure the safety of the passengers, another large safety concern would be other drivers on the road. Yes, the driverless car can sense when it is about to ensue a collision, it does not have the capability to avoid it, just lik any other car. So, as a human, I would rather trust myself for my safety over technology. 
They are insuring that a helpful reason to research this planet would be because it is similar to earth, and a relative distance away. 
The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state's entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.Each candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a "Winner-take-all" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of "proportional representation."What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. There are 5reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of Democratic pedigreeCertainty of OutcomeEveryone's PresidentSwing StatesBig SatesAvoid Run-Off Elections        
"Its a good thing for computers to be able to tell human emotion?" Well Dr. Huang thinks it is a good idea. Now I dont know if it is just me but with all the robots taking over the world thing in movies but 
If the principle did decide to not let phones into schools at all, then i really wouldn't understand why 
Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time. 
For example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of popular votes compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney. It is possible that the winner of electoral will not win due to the national popular vote. 
They text, go on face book, play games, some even talk on the phone. Most kids go to the bathroom to text and talk to people so I think that you should at least let people use there phones at floor. because that would probably stop most of them from texting during class if they can look forward to texting during floor and lunch time and other free times they have during school hours. 
It stated in the article that "A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win."So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for. 
I agree 
Some other people are not good at doing sports or working the year. Some people are different from others. 
it can provide different perspectives, 
"We just don't pass over the Face very often." 
Although, life can be hard without cars 
paris typically has more smog than other european capital.''president obama's ambitious goal to curb the united state greendhouse gas emissiom, unveiled las week,will get a fortuitous 
When you really sit down and think about how most people vote in the Northeast and South they are not the thoughtful voters. 
I am going to argue for the value of having the Facial Action Coding System in the computers. 
students don't want to stay after school 
A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like. 
Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. 
There is also the consideration of laws. In our current era, whoever hits someone initially in a traffic collision, is the one to blame, and the one who helps pay off the other driver's bill. Human error is a natural thing, and we all make mistakes, but if there is ever an accident in which an autonomous car is made and is involved in an accident, who is responsible in the end? Is it the driver, or is it the car which is supposed to be incapable of making mistakes? 
Some students don't have enough hobbies, if they even have any at all. Making them choose an activity could possibly interest them in whatever they chose, and they would start to take up that activity as a hobby. 
Also the way that people feel changes so fast that if you do ask how they feel they could be just fine by then. Also 
I on the other hand, am fine with it. What people fail to see is that because of the electoral college , is that everything is going great, 
my opnion is I believed that is the smart way to make people life more easier, But it will make people to be lazy to drive. 
Although, the teacher is responsible for teaching the class, the student is responsible for knowing which areas they need improvement on. Every student is different, one student may find challenging, another may find it easy. For example, in my geometry class, most students find proportions simple, whereas I find them rather complex and challenging. If I were to design my own summer assignment for geometry, I would include a lot of proportions to ensure I get the needed practice. This is just one of the example of how students know where they need improvement and how a student can help promote their own success. 
it's their summer 
If you are a 15, 16, or 17 year old teenager who is figuring out how to drive,you'll get tired of waiting to drive, you'll be ready to put your hands on the wheel and show everyone that you've grown up. Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver says that "we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way." Some Manufactures hope to do that by bringin in car entertainment. THe purpose of the driverless car is to help texting and driving, this helps by keeping more teens out of accidents. 
Teachers have always wondered how their students were feeling at all times during their lesson, and this software can help them reach out to their students tremendously 
In conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further. 
because when you voete for you candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.after a presidential election , the governor prepares a "certificates" of ascertainment"your state are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidental election. 
When they first took a picture of the face in 1976 it looked nothing like a face it only looked like a smily face and even that was hard to tell. After a couple of years in 1998 in looked like an oval shaped box and it was sunken in. And in 2001 is when started to shape into something over the years in changed and over more years it will change even more. 
To begin, you as the state senator have to keep the "Electoral College"("The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.")in paragraph tree from the article " 
However, some people will raise the point that there are distractions within in the classroom and students will slack off anyway, if they so desire 
When doing extracurricular activities you might find out that you are really good at something. People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. Extracurricular activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding. 
In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents 
In the article the author states that earth and venus are much alike 
There are many advantages to limiting car use. Not only does it improve the environment by removing smog and reducing greenhouse gas emission, but it also allows the area to improve itself by building new features. For this reason, limited car use should be seen as an overall positive idea.    
Isn't it crazy that a face on Mars would be created by aliens? NASA sure seems to think it is. Many sciensts have discovered it's a natural landform. 
I think having the most popular would be better because then most people wont get mad or cause problems because they got to say who they want so its not picked by other people stating that there opinion doesn't matter when really it does. 
I would like to say that doing community service is a good thing, but i do not think you should require the whole school to do it. 
Paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the airr of the global ci ty. If they didnt leave their cars at home they would have been fined for $31.Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-years of intensifying smog. China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world . But paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.. Last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter .President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gasemissions, unveiled last week will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior.With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting asa result of the recession may find less reasons to resume the habit    
For instance, my friend Generic_Name, who is a dancer and soccer player, takes classes online, so she has more time to attend her ballet classes and club soccer practices everyday. Because Generic_Name does not have to get dressed or commute to and from school, she can focus that additional time to dedicate to her interest in dance and sports while still maintaining her education 
Community service is good but not all the students would wan' t you to make it a requirement 
Third the artical aslo said "formed by shadows giving the illusison of eyes, nose, and mouth. 
Help them out by saying you can get more home work done,provide snacks,there species,how to talk better,or write better theres all types of way you can help them. Your the principal and their the students you have to do your job as the adult and they will do there job as the student. 
Over all the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational and that why i think we should get rid of the electoral college its not fair to any voter that wants to vote and think taht there vote isent gonna matter so they dont vote. This is why i think we should get rid of the electoral college and why is is unjust and its not what we want.     
Grades should even go up too. 
looking back at the two planets history, 
So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.  
You might not realize by doing these activities provided for you help you in the long run. 
School can help students achieve a greter goal in life and their understanding of the education and cirriculum is vital. It is an opportunity to get an occupation that they dream and strive to have. Students may think that they will benefit attending classes from home. However, Going to school to attend classes is far much more importants because students will understand more material in the classroom, they can get "hands on" help from teachers to benefit their learning, and improve their mental stamina throught the school day and in their daily life. 
Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our priviledge to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? 
I'm fore the value of using this technology to read students emotional experssions 
It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home. 
Inconclusion, We the people deserve to have our votes count for something. We go out of our way in our daily lives to vote, and they dont even matter, because we vote to have someone else choose for us. "The Electoral Colledge is regarded as a non-democratic way of choosing a president...", ( Richard A. Posner ). We the people have the right to vote, so give us the right to. 
The electoral college is unfair because the winner take all system in most states  they do not have any chance in winning. The electoral college is just outdated, and very irrational. We should abolish the electoral college it is a uncompetitive way for competeing for president. Everyone deserves a fair and even chance and by the electoral college is not. 
It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. In Electoral College the electors are the one who elect the president not the people and my opinion is that its a good idea because not everyone has the same opinion. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 
In paragraph four the passage states,"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This piece of text from paragraph four shows that Venus is the planet most like Earth and had the ability to support life because it use to be covered in oceans. 
Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Well there is this New software that has been developed that can detect how others are feeling better than humans can. 
I don't really like the idea, but it's for the future and anything is possible. For me driverless cars has it's pros and cons. 
I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. If time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad 
Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too." It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology. 
we should be able to chose to do that work 
A student who is knowable able about history may design a project about Ancient Egypt,but if they already know the topic,they aren't learning anything. And while having the students create the projects may allow for more originality in the type and topic of them. That dosen't give the teacher the view of the student that they are meant to give teachers. Most students will design the project if given the chance to be easy so that they can have a good grade to start the year out. But that dosen't let the teacher see their strength and weakness,and the puts them at a disadvantage because the teacher wont know were the need help till it might be to late. If a student knows they have an English timed writing in Ms. Generic_Name class when they get into school,and they get to pic the book they analyze for it. They will pick and book probably that is on the easier side and that they understand. But if they are assigned a book by Ms. Generic_Name, she can see what skills they need when they do the writing. 
School is very important to a students future. It allows different parts of the brain to flourish and grow whether it be in the main subjects like Math, Science, English and History, or even in the arts like music, dance, and theater. Even though students learn new things throughout the year, the new found information can sometimes be forgotten because of the lack of practice, which is why students completing summer projects is so important. The only problem with this is the decision on whether the projects should be student or teacher designed. 
Global warming is real, and it is slowly happening. And cars are major factors for the cause. Some citires are taking action to this by banning driving in some way shape or form. This actually helps bring down smog. Paris saw the difference in only a few days! 
some people didnt like idea because if they give up there cars they wont be able to get to their jobs on time and at the same some people live to far from jobs and homes that they want keep people driving their cars            
Seeking multiple opinions is a great way of making tough disisons. 
Although many students would not like online learning, 
A common challenge that schools face is the maintaining of a "learning environment", although this may be difficult to deal with, this would be impossible for online education to fix. The transfer of learning from schools to the home would cause the "learning environment" to cease to exist. 
Using there phones between classes will also help keep students happy and the happier the student is the more likely they are to focus. 
A electors  college is a process , not a place. The electoral college was established it is the constitution as a conpromise betweet election of the presendent by a vote in congress and electection of the presendent by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The election college it like what person you want to br the presendent , maybe you dont vote for that person maybe someone will vote for them. youcan votefor anyboby only if you think that person is good for the comminuty. 
This will also give them a chance on choosing what style of what of project they want. They could do it on paper or poster or power point and many more. Students coud also base it off of the schedule they have or the days that are free. 
One postive example ofVenus is called the evening star is one the brightest ponits of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amater stragazer to spot 
Students play sports because it gives them a way to express themselves while doing something they love 
I also think if u do that some kids will not try and u would not have as many players so u will have a smaller team for every thing 
A few years later, Micheal Malin and his team took a picture 10x sharper than that of the Viking 1 spacecraft. When the photo first appeared online, it showed nothing but a common mesa that can be found in the American west. 
. Those kids would miss out on learning these skills to drive that everyone else had to learn. 
Well, imagine how much better it would be to look at your situations from different angles. Wouldn't that be pretty nice? 
In other words, humans will be humans and they are capable of betraying others. There are many evil people in the world and the Electoral College does not realize that. 
The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. "Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression" (like not smiling as broadly) Using video imagery. The new emotion-recognition software. They track these special movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units , the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. 
Community service offers an opportunity to kids and adults who feel they want to do something for the community. 
When Luke and Don were traveling over seas in the Seagoing Cowboys,They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, Headed for Greece. The cargo was 335 horses and enough oats to feed all the horses.Before arrivingt in Greece,Luke turned 18, Which back then meant that Luke could be drafted for military service.A couple years later he was discharged,Luke had made nine trips,The most of any Seagoing Cowboy ever. The cattle boat trips were an unbelieveable experience for Luke being a small town boy. Before helping anyone he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But Luke also got to see the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice,Itlay.Luke also toured at the evacuated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States and a month to China.Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to eat and give the animals water three times a day. Bales of hay and oats had to be pulled from the lower ship. The stalls had to be cleaned. 
In conclusion, I am for this technollogy to read students emotinoal feelings because i would like to know how everyone is feeling and acting the way they are. For instance, what if it is a friendand no matter how close you are they will not t ell you if they are upset or happy and if you had this technollogy you could tell what they are feeling because they could lie and say they are not feeling anything which then this technollogy could then help with that.         
TO THE FELLOW CITIZENS OUT THERE WE ARE LIMITING CAR'S BECAUES PEOPLE DONT LIKE TO PAY THERE CAR, BECAUES THEY EIGTHER DONT HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT OR THEY JUST DONT WANNA PAY IT.. PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY DONT LIEK AYING THER CADR THATS WHY PEOPLES CAR GET TODE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LAZY..WHEN A CHILD HAS A SOCCER GAME TO GO TO WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU DONT HAVE A CAR TO GET THERE ?OYU PROBABLY DO EVERYTHING YOU CANTO GET THERE TO SUPPORT YOUR CHILD... 
To conclude, students can reap many benefits from online classes that would facilitate their growth both in and out of school. Attending class online gives the student control of learning in a way that is preferrable to them, which is important because then students will comprehend more and learn effectively, and gives the opportunity to explore interests with the extra time at hand to grow as an individual. It would be an absolute waste of resources if schools failed to take advantage of such technologies that could improve students' education and well-being. Not only is the availability of online classes beneficial to the students, but it is useful in an emergency such as a threat of a school shooting, which is unfortunately a prominent issue and possibility in the modern world, or a viral outbreak. Technology has changed drastically from when the school system was first established and normalized and so has society, so it's imperative that the schools take action to adapt to the changing world, especially now in the wake of a global pandemic.  
In conclusion the technology to read peoples facial expressions is a great idea because the computer could help students out if they dont understand the work just by reading there faces.   
Everyone thinks differently and has their own perspective on everything. This is why many people have very different ideas and opinions 
In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.            
It's exactly like a classroom setting, with the only difference being that the student isn't physically there. In the future, with even more and more technological advances, these virtual interactions will become even more effective. Distance learning would also help to block out the other distractions that come with school. 
Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment. Giving an individual the ability to plan and create their own project is teaching them how to manage tasks on their own 
he elecoral collage should stay the same because it worked this long right and it will keep working as long as everythis is fair. 
Another reason would be it would help out with discipline 
Secondly, When giving a student their own time to finish their work and nothing but the guilt of not getting a good grade being their motivation, there will always linger the question of "Will they get it done?". To that I asked, is school not meant to teach us the tools we need to survive the "adult world"? As teenagers we are always told to learn the importance of time management before we get into our careers and even college. However, there are no courses for these types of things but, instead we are expected to learn them through first-hand experience and natural growth. 
I feel community service is important because giving back to your community your family, neighbors and friends is the best thing you can do to make strong powerful relationships with your family 
Driving has been central to the American way of life for a large span of time, and if manually driving cars has been working, why change it? Driverless cars have been beiong tested since the 50's, so there clearly is no rush in getting these cars on the street. Also, once these cars are available to the public they will most likely only be accesable to the rich. In time the driverless cars would be more affordable, but the original prices would be high 
I think that kids with a c average or higher could be able to play sports but kids with d or f averages should have to get their grades up and get help if they need help. 
The author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus suggested to study venus is a worthy pursuit despite it condtions and or dangerous risks. 
we are lucky that 2000 situation was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows far worse. our legislatures are responsible technically for picking electors, and the chosen electors can always go against the will of the people. 
They will hide them from the teachers .Teachers can't go threw the students stuff any way . Just make the kids put them in there locker during class.If you do a lot of the students will dich school any way, to be on there phones. You will just make all the kids mad. 
different people from different cultures can have other ideas. 
Since it can let you know when someone is lieing 
Many schools throughout the world offer distance learning as an option for students to attend online classes 
it allows you to see the situation from many different viewpoints, 
The Facial Action Coding System technology that let you reads emotional expressions of students. 
just don't ask old people or they will give you a story and it will be long and boring. 
In " The Challenges of Exsploring Venus" how the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is by comparing venus to earth 
Summer is fun and special to so many students who currently go to school. School work is dreadful to many, but designing projects does not sound too bad. Designing projects can be fun and a new experience for many. New ways to learn instead of the old traditional boring way can be interesting. Giving students a little freedom would not hurt. Students should be able to decide what they want to do with these projects as it is a great chance for students to discover many new things. 
In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to effectively retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult. 
If the numbers are high than go with the second policy But if the numbers are low then go with the first policy. 
often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves . 
and the atmosphere and heat 
Another reason I am against this is for the teachers side of things. 
You have the best food out there too 
participating in a sport 
There is no need for you to require community service in our school. Don't force students to be a volunteer, because then it just wouldn't be volunteering. They wouldn't be as willing to do the service, and they might not do the job as well as they would if they did it by choice, and the community service would be a waste of time if the helper didn't do it right or well enough. 
it will show you all the negative ideas. 
At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Becasue of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. 
Slate Magazine that ,"... each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..." This basicaly means that we get to choose which candidate that we can trust with more big political problems.  This shows that we will be heard through these electors that we know we can trust. Although it different cases, this might become a democratic problem from we are not able to speak personally, atleast we know how they will manage and work the elections properly. 
improve the emotional well being of students, 
Yes, online classes are meant to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction 
it would be very diffucult to do the thing you want to do! 
When you are driving a car you hear a text pop up on your phone and you want to get it so bad and you do but, when you do you stop paying attention to the road for just a minute then a car behind you hunks because you aren't driving right and that make you jump so you start driving right. The driver was just lucky that he just got hunk at or it could've binned much worst like a car accident, and someone could have got hurt 
What? you've never heard of it well let me help you. To start you of you shoould consider yourself lucky it was the biggest election crisis in a century. The worst thing that frightens me is just knowing that even though the legislatur is responsible for picking the electors, the electors have the choice to defy us the as the people 
After reading the passage I am able to infer the main idea, which was the author supporting his idea of Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The infernace I was able to capture,"human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors."(para.8.) This paragraph gives us the idea of us humans. We could be told one millions times not to do somehting, but at the of the day we all end uo doing it like it or not. 
While that might be true, students who are required to participate in at least one extracurricular do have a choice in what club or clubs they join. That choice is explained well by Dr. Matthew Brown, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington State who said, "even when students are required to participate in something -- either a class or an activity -- they still always have some sort of choice, whether that is what activity to do or what mindset to have." Using both sets of logic previously stated, when the students choose what club to participate in, they will experience the largest amount of positive results. 
even during when i played wrestling, or football i had a D and one F but i got the F up but they still wouldn't let me practice or do anything because i still got that D. What I think the you as a principle should do is u should be at least passing five of your classes and should have at least a grade point average of 1.5. At my school in the SCHOOL_NAME is that policy and i am glad too have it but it didn't really matter to me because i was just falling! I was falling because of all my test and everything 
the author tells us about some details about the temperatures, 
They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy 
People think getting advice from more than one person is to confusing to get. Some people think it's the best option. Other people that they're both right. 
As long as the teen can be in a closed environment with less distractions it should not be that big of a problem 
As with many students, receiving an education and taking classes is associated with a physical school building. Students are often aware of the two main options for school: attending public/private institutions or home school. Each option offers different advantages and disadvantages but seem to be on opposite sides of a continuum. The option of taking online classes provide the benefits of both attending an in person school and home school. It can be seen as a middle ground on the continuum as taking online classes in addition to regular classes at school may increase learning 
What this can prove is that the process of expression recognization requires no harm to the face or person and is created by the studies of not only technological professionals, but also psychological preoffesionals as well. 
The facial action coding system has many promising applications 
The car also lets you know if there are any problems or if it needs help. 
I think you not let kids with a Fshould not play because then need to have higher than a F in the grade book 
Also,the Electoral College should be removed from our way of voting; we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because the electoral college is a disaster waiting to happen 
The mesa is big and does look like a face at first glance ,but there is no way you can prove it. 
Venus is ideal for humaninty, if Earth became not ideal for humaninty anymore. The previous article about Venus " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is a good article to read, because it describes Venus and it's dangers and it's benfits. 
As you can see,getting rid of cars would be very beneficial to our society. Our air will be cleaner,streets will be safer and best of all,we'll have more money to spend.    
All in all one letter will not change everyone's opinion but it seems like the people who want to remove the electoral college are anachronism instead of the electoral college themselfs it seems like they want to remove them so that the winner take all system will be better on there half so that the running canidate can appeal to the bigger states and win most of their votes."Voters in presidential elections are people who want to expresss a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election." There is nother more that can be said but the reason why this letter was written in the first place, to keep the electoral college.    
I also think it is a great idea to not allow students to partake in school activities, such as dances and field trips, if their grades are not up to par. 
"Its hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abloish the electoral college!". "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives?". By Bradford plumer fam 
The facts of reading this letter are so you can decide if students should bring cell phones to school. How about if you Mr. principal caught students with their cell phones during classes and if they are not paying attention you should suspend them for having their cell phones in class. 
what if Venus is not as hot as the Sun but what if Venus is hot for anything to be on there, in the article " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" In paragraph 3 it says "Venus tempreture average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit." 
Kids do not leaned by placing them in a room for eight hour a day for all most 1/4 of there lives. We learned more by doing school activities, 
Policy two is a better choice 
Eventhough the text says is takes away the chance I still think it reduces it I mean look at the Bush family they did a horible job and guess who elected them the electors. 
Learning occurs when one gains knowledge on things they did not know beforehand, so if they work on topics they are fond of, no learning will take place. In addition, students may not want to expand upon what they already know and challenge themselves because it is summer break, their time to be free. They are likely to do the minimum in order to be done so it leaves available time for more road trips and vacations. 
But you could make a volunteer community clean up club for our school. 
They shouldn't go Because of the risks, Some peopel might want to go because of the golory of acheaving that goal for NASA but its just not safe to risk exploring a plant that has bad condictions. 
Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. 
Another example is if you want to buy your best friend a gift for her birthday but you don't know what to get her. You decide to ask your friends to help you pick a present and they don't know what to get her either, so you decide to ask her boyfriend what you should get her and he tells you that she told him that she wanted to take a trip to the spa. Then you would know what to get your friend because you asked someone else who knew more about the situation. 
In my opinion students should not be required to do community service but every few weeks we should have a sign-up sheet for a certain service that people may participate in. 
Students can pretty much go on the internet and look up answers for a test or quiz they didn't study for and I don't know about you but i think that's cheating 
it would help the student complete work faster without having to travel from classroom to classroom. 
The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. 
I believe the author is trying to say that Venus is worth exploring to see if it is able to be like Earth once more 
in paragraph 4 the author states that Venus is "a sister planet," and also" astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. 
On the other hand, Electoral College avoids the run-off elections,"the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast 
We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities. 
Although learning from the comfort of their own home may seem appealing to students, being educated through a screen is not as beneficial as the real life interactions that occur inside schools 
students are more likely to understand their peers' schedule and difficulties in the content; 
after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.        
One reason students should be forced to take at least one school activity is some students after school just go home immediately to watch television or use their phones,the reason this is a problem is because that isn't good for their heath 
Another reason would be texting in class. 
avoid a large number of "swing" state 
some may argue that allowing students to design their own project encourages the design of lazy, easy, and uninspired projects. After all, why would a student intentionally design a complex project for a time span intended to be a break? 
The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast. 
i belive that bob dole was right to abolish the electoral college it makes it fair to the candidates.                   
When we use the Electoral College it helps us figure out the differents of each election. 
I was just informed that i'm not really voting for the president, i am voting for the official voter that will then, in turn vote for the president(Using their own biases). 
In the Challenge of the Exploring Venus, the auther suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers I think he I right, but i think that the dangers are to much to risk. 
Most people I know, including me dont start even looking at the projects that the teachers give to us until the night before schools starts, but if we as students create our own we already know what we have to accomplish.Due to the amount of excitment for their projects, there will be a large increase in the number of students who complete the task and get a good grade, which starts the school year off on a good note.I always tend to work best and work harder on the subjects and or topics I enjoy the most.I would also complete my work in full if it was intresting to me. 
This technology allows us to know how a person is feeling or allows us to know how a person was feeling when a picture was taken. 
If something were to happen they could tell there parents what is going on or if they get in trouble they could text or call there parents to say "pick me up at this time because i have to stay after" 
Yes, in my opinion, Electoral College is a good idea.In the cases of having an Electoral College there are some up sides of this and some down sides. 
Another example of why that the "face" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that "There was no alien monument after all." 
Additionally, simply put, some students may just learn better in an online environment. Attending a school with thousands of students is not necessarily the most desirable environment for every student, not every day. 
There are there flaws though it's kinda hard to be constantly on the move with a spouse or heck maybe kids too just at home. 
when doing a project it could help with bonding. 
yes I do agree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity. 
And sometime when they are passing the street of school a car come an have an accented just buy texting and not focusing if a car is coming. 
who's fault would it be the would the accident be on? 
order 
The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , 
the use of using cras less it a much saver 
But I told him that it was a natural landform because when we waited to get the best picture in 1998 all we saw was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. 
If we could read their emotions it would be easier to help people to get better if they are in a bad place in life. 
Can voters control whom their electors vote for ? Not always. 
Now days it tis not hard to hack into a computor and take pictures of the person on the other side. 
,tools from school that you may need, 
Advice could come come in anyway or shape such as lessons,games,work,sports,internet,habitat,style, and etc all it matters is that you know what your doing. 
. This new software can help students function in the classroom when they are confused or bored they can easily get help rather than being ignored 
So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this. 
But saying phones aren't allowed would not be fair because of the good kids who use when allowed. 
However, allowing the students to use their cell phones, would boost their morale, and make them happier 
In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren't for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving. 
"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes, is required to elect the President." 
You could have so much fun being apart of this journey.I think being apart of this program would be a awesome opportunity because not alot of people could do this and be apart of a program. You also get to see really cool things like antique artifacts,really old buildings,and diffrent lifestyles. This would be so much fun because you can learn how other people live their lifes in different countries,and explore places you never thought you would even go to. You could also see different cultures and try their kind of food they eat every day,and see how people in different countries go about their everyday lifes. 
I as a scientist believe that it is also a landform coinencidently in the shape of a face. 
the project can give the student an insight of what the class will be like. 
you could learn from others opinions and could make better choices next time. 
While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of "In the real world" and " Highschool is preparing you for the real world". Later on in life, "in the real world", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help. 
Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. 
The reason I think the author did good is because the author seemed to know what they were talking about. 
In " The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe 
you would probably have to find a place that you can put your car like a garage at work or a parking lot that will have to fit millions of cars at a time. 
"NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted "huge rock formation... which rembles a human head. fprmed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars." (3)"The "Face on Mars" has since become a pop icon." (5) When I first saw it i had no idea what the face was, i thought maybe it was just me that saw it or something. I would have never guessed that it would become so big to us. 
I  can see why people dont like that because certain states like florida has the maximum of 29 electoral votes, but wyoming only has a maximum of 3 electoral votes. 
The passage later explains examples of NASA's approached to studying Venus when the author says, "Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II." The idea of looking back on past resources to help the studying of Venus would help the process. This past project is a key tool that helps support that Venus should be studied even though it can be extremely dangerous. Using past experiences such as the ones included helps support and grow the authors idea. 
not voting will not effect the election. 
When choosing a president everyone has their own opinion on who they think will make the country better, so people vote for them. Some people even try to persuade others to vote for this person then they give their reason/opinion to why they should vote for them. Then there's other people who disagree with others, and will share why they think that president shouldn't become president 
It is time for teacher-designed projects, which can be less interesting, stressful for families, and rushed, to be replaced by student-designed projects where students are independantly creative. Although it is good for schools to make sure all their children are not losing skills over the break, the same skills would be practiced if children got more freedom to design their own activity. Plus, summer work would be full of more enjoyment and acedemic value! 
The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it officail !!!. Also arguments against direct elections are apurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.  
The 3rd stroy was about how in Bogota, Comlombia they do a car-free day, now that should be done here in the U.S.. It says that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during car-free day, that the streets of the captial city eerily devoid of traffic jams, and that the rain has not stopped people from participating.The last stroy talks about how the car culture is coming to an end, but i really hope not and i think not. It is here ,in the U.S., the birthpalce of the Model T, a classic car that i love and i would hope so that a lot of more people do too; the home of Detroit, what i know is that they make cars up there; tha place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally", I do not know what that is but it does sound important. It also says that " driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..." I mean the highest it went was 2009, we are in 2014, almost 2015, im a young person and i love to drive i think and feel like i can go as fast as light. 
whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if its a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a life long friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple people helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just arent sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased.In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with. 
Getting along socially with other people isn't a given, we spend up to 16 years in the class room together nurturing key social skills that we will continue to use throughout our entire lives. Now imagine what would happen if you were taken out of the classroom. The effects would be devastating, you would miss out on the social development you gain from schooling and it would cause turmoil. This would be such a massive problem because social skills are a key instrument to have when in the work place, if you not able to articulate ideas and information to fellow employees properly it would strip these what wouldve been bright employees to substandard workers not fit for upper management jobs 
Luke got to go all around the world and see amazing places 
In the article he writes " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, "since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to. 
I think the author supports the idea well 
The "Face on Mars" has become popular. 
I think it is a good thing then all you will have to do is say to your computers how do i feel today it will say to you 
A third good reason as to why summer projects should be student made is that it will make life easier for the teachers 
Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. 
The downside to having popular vote would be that if a candidate were to convice the American people to follow his commands like Adolf Hitler did and lead them blindly then that would be a major problem. 
Voters should be alowed to directly vote for who they want to be president and not rely on the lectoral college.    
passenger cars are responcible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United states. with less cars people have the advantages of being a walk away from a store instead of a highway 
I recently heard you wanted to change the school policy on sports and other activities, so that only students with a grade average of a B or higher can participate. 
it's just a illusion it wasn't acutually seen or proven to be a human head. 
Going in favor of Electoral College has only one good favor like in Source 1 it says that "The Cerificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent oyur state at the meeting of the electors in Decemeber of the election year." 
To further explain,when you weigh out options you are determining how one decision or choice you make can be more beneficial than the other choice or decision. If Generic_Name would have went to a trusting adult or relative, they could have informed her about the pros and cons of dating apps. They could have informed her about the number of kidnaps or deaths that relate to dating apps,or the low number of striving relationships. With that knowledge, Generic_Name could have weighed out her options. She could have used that knowledge to make a better choice. For example, Generic_Name's options were to be single and discontinue the use of the dating app, or meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship. If the cons seemed worse on the ''meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship'' side, than she would have weighed out her options, and chosen to be single. When you weigh out your options, make sure you have full knowledge on all possible choices. 
Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about 
I would like it to be scanned just to see my emotions, many people would agree with me on this as well. People who could get their hands on this could use it too much or go over the top with this tech. Also, since there is people who probobly don't like this type of technology, they would throw a fit it they would have to use it. 
The reason i choose this as a beneficial reasoning is because many kids need respect now days. 
Adavntages of limiting your car usage can actually be benifitical to you and your family, maybe even the earth you live on. 
Some may claim that the project must be chosen by teachers, as it is their occupation and that they know what is best for the students to succeed. 
They talk about what they going to bring and how far it is and what they are going to be doing. in the passage he talked about what happen in the war and how did it affect . and maybe having electronics up there too. 
Asking people for advice can sometimes help you make a better choice. Viewing other peoples perspective, getting more information on the topic, and getting honest feedback can help you decide on a better choice. 
An educational study at Yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the SAT compared to those of a self taught student at home. This is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to insure that they retain previous knowledge and can build off of it. With the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. It allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal , and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project. 
but the pros of teachers creating the project definitely outweigh the cons. 
A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them. 
Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. 
Us people that do want to do it should not do all day community service like the others. Also don` t punish the other people bad. They are just not helpful enough or just don't want to do nothing at all. 
And they dont need to know every little thing going on in our lives. 
These are all of the reasons why I think its a great idea to have a club to help the community and the people in it so it will be clean and the people would feel like they are cared and people would want to be their friend. 
but the american people the real voters want a voice. also the winner-take-all system is just like not fair. 
In conclusion I think that the face on Mars was naturally made for alot of valid reasons . At the end of the day we might not ever know what made the face on Mars, we can only have our thoughts and oppiouns on Who or What made the structure. 
Afterall, he is going to be our president not just the 538 electors. "Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational," says Bradford Plumer. some people may wander whats wrong with the electoral college? why isnt that a good idea? well in source two of mine it says "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electorors, who in turn elect the president." its also stated that "at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."    
But really every one's vote does. 
To me I still dont think thats enough evidence and detail to say I would stay home. 
Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down. 
Teachers can see the learning style of students by including different types of questions bases on different learning styles. In the projects,they design they could included questions that appeal to visual learners as well as topics that appeal to mental learners. In math and science,they can included different ways of getting to the solution to see which way the student do the best on. This allows the teacher to create assignments that cater to the students. Since every batch of students is different this allows the teacher to change their curriculum to fit the students they have this year so that they can leave successful and ready for what ever next. Not all years are going to be the same, Ms. Generic_Name might have a bunch of auditory learners one year but the next she has a bunch of tactile learners and if she designs her projects to look for that. She can plan accordingly and change her style a little so the students still leave her class successful. 
I would pick policy 1 
Can you tell if someone is happy or sad? 
There is always more than one side to every story. Seeing more than one point of view at a situation can help advise you toward making the best decision. One persons point of view may be way different from an others, meaning they may have had a totally different experience, and/or have many different opinions than another person 
Last, the author gives more ways Venus can be studied safely using different technology. 
What if you have a job then you would not be able to sat after. 
Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. 
What if your principal said that everyone would have to stay after school for and extra hour only to participate in a useless activity? How would you feel if someone where to interfere with your schedule? The school says that we must participate in an extracurricular activity. You might be wondering why the school would want us to participate in a club. The whole reason is because they think that it would shape our future, give us a learning experience, and make us want to learn something new. Although this is true, there are more downsides to this rule than you think 
Now you see Mister Senater, why we need the electoral college system. Without it everything willl be really stressful and everythings already stressful. 
The author think's venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. 
This would affect the buyers and manufacturers in a negative way. 
I think we should change to election by popular vote because so that everyone can vote, 
Students should or should or should not do at least one extracrrcular activity 
Furthermore, all different ages of students today are constantly stressed out with the massive workload that is forced upon them each day. One of the many consequences of this is that the students may not actually be learning the material beceause of how focused they are on the responsibilities they have for other classes. A facial recognition system such as FACS could be programmed to detect when a student's facial expression demonstrates stress, and notify the school so they can proactively help the student cope with this stress before the situation worsens. This will help the student relax and focus better. 
Like i've stated before, change can go in a good or bad way. There is no way saying it could be both or could be something completly different. We just got to be careful with what we have now or they may be no future. 
The bad thing in this is that some parents mite think it is a bad thing because they know there kid is doing there best but is not making a B so they cant play sports, so you mite have issues with that. 
It's great in theory, having the ability to work at your own pace and work from home 
Online schools can really make a big change in kids that are just not ready have more stress in them and wouldnt have to deal with more problems with parents or maybe getting bullied 
The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do 
In this process it begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face. Dr huang relies on the work of the pyschologists as Dr Paul Eckman creator of FACS the did the test on Eckman and he had happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intened to bring a smile to eveybody face when you go and see the painting. 
get a break from learning all day 
Which is a good law and one that was very needed. There should be a law for that everywhere in the united states to help drivers so that they can avoid car accidents. 
This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could "even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class 
Some may argue the Electoral; college is an anachronism 
Students think community center takes their time away. 
In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.      
I think my principle should required some of my friends should perform community service because they need to learn what mistake's they've done. 
Therefore being comfortable can help your work ethic. 
For example, I started my first season of marching band last fall and now it is a very important thing to me and I have made it one of my life goals to march in D.C.I. (Drum Core International): where the best and biggest marching bands in the world compete for title of grand champion. 
I am aware that you are aware that some kids from our school are debating wether to do community service or not. I would highly encourage you to help these boys see the benefit in doing this. I know for a fact that I am doing this to better our community and our school. 
I want to take the time to speak my mind and said whats wrong with the clectoral college.  
Many poeple are saying it looks as if it's a face or some sort. Some peopel are even saying aliens have put it on Mars to tell us soemthing, but I hilly dout that. 
They may fail to give the proper signals, miss road signs, change lanes abruptly or respond slowly to hazards. Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident. So, if checking your phone is going to cause you to get mad and drive like you've got no sense and possibly kill someone, then there's no need in even picking it up. 
The passage talks about all the positive and negative things that would make Venus be good to study because of some of theories of it being Earth like 
same of there grade are C' s and that all there grade in there class room. most kid have grades of a c' s they sould still be in sports or activities. the kid listen, pass test, do they homework just to be in a sport or activities. 
applies different experiences. 
I think that teachers are to mean these days, 
Its just a rock that looks strange dont all rocks look strange they are all unique & some strange ones they are a lot of type of rocks in the life,dont think the the rocks are the same. Were different. 
The summer projects should be designed by the teachers 
Now we have a great way of dectecting someone else emotions. 
The way this process work is to have the computer with 3-D contructs and a computer model of the face and have to build the human like human muscles which it's called "action unit"which made by Dr. Huag and Dr. paul Eckman, the creator of facts of "facial action coding system". during his own creation he knows the six basic emotions like happiness, surrise, anger, disguet, fear and sadness plus characteristic movements of that new computer model they making out of 3-D.It says that when the computer model wakes up everyday it have the same impressive calculation so it really means it still acts the same from yesterday like saying when u have a friend that like being happy randomly from yesterday well your friend can still act the same the next day which you is wathing your temper, when Dr. Huang haves a computer soft where that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. 
Another reason why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free times is because many are involved with some sort of after school activity. 
Students are already required to be at school and work for 7 hours a day and 35 hours a week. The extra activities at the end of the day can add on up to 4 hours of extra time to the already long school day, making it up to 50 hours per week. Some sports practices even go until 7:30 PM and also require students to meet on the weekends. Students are already exhausted and unhappy with the current school day, and forcing an extra 15 hours a week will have a devastating effect on the previously unhappy students. 
Studies show that when given the same situation, almost 80% of people choose different ways to solve them. This is beneficial because it shows that everyone has their own ways of solving problems, so when you ask people around you which choice they would make in a certain situation you will get many different ways. This can help you think through each suggestion and decide which one is right for you. 
There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is really bad because students end up having less hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible. 
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a very beneficial 
That is much more rewarding. 
the testing on diffrent pieces of equitmeant to withstand the extreme climate of venus, 
On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possibe but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote 
If our presidents were picked directly by the people (popular vote) there would be a dispute because of needs and what the people want. Not only that but peoples favoritism would show. Even though the Electoral College vote depends upon many peoples vote towards one president it is smarter. 
After many years of no one has changed anything else about the election camagign or anything. I think its time to do that. Lets put a girl in the office she can do just as good as a men. 
it less complicated than the Electoral vote that can create a big mess 
First of all what happen is someone is depress and dont want to tell anyone about it so they kill their self because they're depress 
And I think there would be a giant hole around the face because were they needed the rock or whatever it is on mars to make the face. And its like a cloud kinda just because it looks like a bunny or dog dont mean someone made it look like one somethings just happen that way 
if the principal forced students to do extracurricular activities, it would make students more stressed out then they should be. If students don't like the activity they have to do, why do they have to take that activity? The poor students wouldn't have time to breath, and go home. Students relaxing time would be school time, so which one do you choose? Forcing students to live under school, or allow students to have their own life after school, with no consequences.  
If students didnt have to go to school there would be a lot more time for students to have to have fun and to enjoy the young life. 
Skills such as teamwork and realtionship-building are key development skills that are primarily formed in a school-like environment. Going to school and interacting with fellow students and teachers builds confidence skills and speaking skills; some important traits that are needed for a career based world 
On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day had come and it was time to take a picture of the Face. The photo was taken with maximum resolution, and when people saw the picture there was no mistaking it for a landform on Mars. 
What all four storys are saying is that cars will be gone sooner or later, i hope later, but the cars is what we need to go places. The car will enither be gone or be impovred some how, the fliying car maybe, but in till that happens, because i live in now, the car is what we have, i know that it's bad for the air, so instead of not using the car we can make it better, better for the world.  
If someone is looking for advice and they get multiple answers on what type of advice to take, they'll ask other people if it's good advice or not so they can narrow down if they want to take that advice or ask for better advice.Another way getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is if they are making a bad decision getting multiple good opinions on why that decision is bad could help them stop doing bad things and make them do good things. 
Keeping the earth clean but banning cars can make the enviornment a better place. 
The computer might be able to detect the persons emotions by characterlise there facial muscles by the expression movements but the student might be annoyed that it does this all the time and doesnt like it 
possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray of venus. bump like vehical hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. like a jet airplane travel at ahigher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the deadly ground conditions by staying up and out of the their way. researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus.NASA have come up with example of tool that can help build a safe ship for human to travel to venus. some simplified electronics made of silicon carbibe have been testred in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in venus conditions. mecchanical computers which is an old technology might help people explore venus. peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited on ground. most light cannot penetrate the dense atomoshpere, rendering standard forms of photograhy and videography ineffective. 
while giving them more time to do the things they enjoy. 
advice is more credible when given from multiple sources. If many people give you the same advice the odds of it being correct are greatly increased. 
Research has found that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk drivers. 
For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen. 
 Because classes will take place on digital devices, it is possible for students to text or even call their teachers and classmates. If people have an issue with the fact that you cannot see the other person's face, there is always the possibility of video calling him or her. Communicating online is arguably just as good if not better than communicating face to face. Students who have difficulty interacting with other people have the option to simply text or email them, while students who have no problem socializing can call them. Letting students choose a communication method will allow them to be comfortable in their working environment and motivate them to try their best to learn. 
Aslo if is there a tie in the Electoral College the election would be thrown at the House of Representative and giving the Senate the opportunity to select the president, leading to more complexity for choosing a president. 
this quote explains how canidates can not get majority rule over the other canidate. Electoral College should be replaced with majority rule 
The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers within the Constitution, was meant to serve as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of citizens. What the founding fathers failed to see was the many outstanding flaws within the Electoral College. For many imperative reasons that cannot be avoided, 
Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. 
I think because, some students are silent and this option help you. 
Another example is helping out the elderly people, like carrying their grocery bags or helping them clean up their back yards 
Also it would give students a time to socialize with people. 
Another reason why it woud be helpful is because you could use it on anyone not just students. 
In the introduction, the author is describing Venus and explaining how "The Evening Star." Is the nickname, but beyond that- paragraph 1 and 2 wasn't explaining why you should pursuit it. 
This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinon. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligble American citizens to decide presidency. 
Another benefit is that students could attend distant schools that would not be practical to attend in person. Besides the saved travel time, switching to more online classes would eliminate a great deal of paper waste, as many more assignments and materials would probably be online. This would benefit the environment, and it would keep students from having to keep track of both physical and digital assignments and documents. Finally, school systems could save money on a great deal of physical infrastructure, such as school buildings, classroom materials, and buses. The funds saved could be redirected towards giving students computers, paying teachers more, or investing in better learning resources. Overall, the saved time and money from switching to more online classes would significantly benefit students and teachers. 
All of the failed tests because no one studied, not giving a hoot. The school shutting down, kids being moved to a different school. And who's fault was it? Yours. I like school, I know it is rare, but please... no cell phones! I want to see my teachers again. Day after day, have some pity on one child. Think of tomorrows future, don't you want to be apart of shaping it? 
One's home is, oftentimes, an environment which establishes a sense of comfort. This setting, compared to a classroom, removes the aspect of healthy competition among students and inhibits a student's drive to accomplish tasks through peer-to-peer interactions. 
when preparing to go into 8th grade, I couldn't decide which elective class I should take. I narrowed the decision down to either Art or Tech Ed. I didn't know what to do, so I asked all three of my older sisters who had recently gone through Generic_School, the school that I was currently at. One of my sisters said she loved Art and I should take it. Another said that a lot of boys enjoy Tech Ed, and you get to build a lot of cool stuff. I was still on the fence, so I asked my dad. He said the stuff you do and the tools you use in Tech Ed will be a lot more useful as my life went on. I came to the final decision of Tech Ed. This is just one example of why asking for advice of multiple people with different experiences is so important. If I had just listened to what my first sister said, I would probably be doing Art. 
In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. 
Lets talk about abolishin the electoral college. When you vote, do you think you vote for the president? No. When you vote u dont vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The people of America should consider themselfs lucky that the 2000 fiasco election was the biggest election crisis in a century, says the article in setion 2. Honestly if the article syas that Bob Dole was right why even have the electoral college! 
Although it is not the most persuasive support and idea he displays that Venus is a worthy pursiut, 
I agree on the position of having a system of communication for school work. 
Although there may be debate about the ways in which online school can be taken advantage of, people should learn to focus on the best in children and the online system, not their potential and minuscule disadvantages. Permitting students to attend classes from home has a variety of advantages. Among those, the most evident ones are that students can focus more of their time on their passions, learn better, and preserve their health without concern of missing class. Schools are meant to be a place where students can grow by obtaining knowledge and applying it. Whether classes are online or in-person should not matter greatly (though online may actually be more helpful), as the outcome of an education will remain the same. Thus, experiencing learning via video conferencing and online resources is a solution to both improve the quality of education and the well being of students in the long-term.  
The guideline would explain the things needed for it and how it should be graded, and letting students know how it will be graded will help immensely when design it.It will also help the students to figure out ideas for their design instead of them just being completely out in the open. So making a guild line will make both the teacher and students feel more secure and confident in the project being designed and completed. 
The Electoral College is a process that consists of 538 electors. Each state equals the number of members in the house of representives. The Electoral also select what their responsibilities are. 
It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system 
The electoral college is based of popularity in a state. 
If you have a smile on your face, thats great, the other person thinks your happy even if you arnt. If I want someone knowing what I am feeling, I am going to tell them. I dont just want them or some computer reading my muscles in my face and telling me what emotion I am feeling. 
After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election. 
Well that's all I got to say so thank you for your time on reading this letter. Please put these thoughts into consideration. 
It also makes sure that a candidate doesn't have a regional appeal. 
They would rather sit on the couch every day eating potato chips and watching T.V instead of going outside and working and helping your community. 
Generic_Name lives in a low income area of where he lives and his education is not going the best but with online schooling he could receive education from elsewhere. There are millions of students just like Generic_Name that just want a better education, and with online school this is possible. This isnt just low income areas many schools in higher income areas give poor educations too. Generic_Name lives in north Dakota and there are NO schools in his area but with online classes he could attend online school in a different state. Rather than living near a low quality school Generic_Name dose not live near any schools at all. With online schooling Generic_Name could get the education he needs to be a success in the modern world. In conclusion online schooling give learning opportunities to those who would not normally receive them. 
As a quarterback for my football team, I am in constant need of improvement on my skills to further our chances of success. I always ask my coach on what he thinks I need to improve on. He always gives me his feedback, and a way he thinks I could improve on that problem. Sometimes his advice doesn't completely fix the issue, so I go to my parents for help. My parents know my strengths and weaknesses, and help my to fix the problem tailoring my coach's advise to me. This gives me an option that not only works, but fits me as a person. 
When Michael Malin went up to take a picture of the the face they got a sharper snap for the picture. 
While some may say that giving a student these freedoms leaves them at greater risk for slacking off completely, 
Though most people would be disgusted by the idea of picking up trash at the beach or helping out at retirement home, 
they are there to avoid problems of election in which no candidates receives a majority of votes 
Seeking multiple opinions when you are making a decision helps you make a better choice 
"New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving emotions of others." This new software is called Facial Action Coding System. The passage states, "This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries." The software detected in the Mona Lisa painting that she is "83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." 
The states that are larger such as Texas and california have a much larger population so the votes would be larger but the electoral college balances out and the smaller states such as new jersey and main have a small population so the votes wold be smaller. The larger states get more attention from the presidential candidates than the smaller states, so the electoral college balences it out.(sourse 3)
Although the government thinks the hands free law is going to help the risk of crashes, the hands free law could be much less safe than using your hands. 
While yes, teachers usually assign projects so a student does not go off topic, 
Third, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, some time students will be sick and students won't attend classes. 
The money that is put into the FACS is way more than a school could possibly They could use the money to fix something around the school. The FACS is just way out of hand. 
keeps everything even and mostlikely fair. 
but a better way to observe the idea of a driverless car is to think of it as a car, just like any other, with a few extra features; and one of those features happens to be that the car is capable of driving itself. 
The start of the Electoral College is well handingly choosing the electors, which consists of 538 electors each of course must be qualified. 
if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. 
asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one is because not only will you gain more knowledge about one trait, you'll gain two. The other trait is open mindedness. 
The school never answerer the phone so they can talk to parents. That is why we should be aloud to have phone in this hell hole. The teachers would not like that but they could get over it and like it. I don't no why they think we don't take are phone to class because we do. The teachers have there's and they ant aloud to have them. There phone go off and they don't get in trouble like we do. I think that is wrong but you no how they pay each other so they wont right each other up. They don't have the right to play on the phone. 
For example in paragraph 6 it says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" Dr. Huang predicts . "Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ." That is what the teacher is here for to modify the lesson if the student does not understand the assignment . Why let a computer take over ?  
Dr. Huang is predicing that the tecnology could have a "effective human instructor 
help people 
The advances of limiting car usage is not only helping the communtity but also yourself 
The last reason i can think of is students might actually do their work so they can have their phone out. 
Although the intentions behind distance learning have just reasoning the widespread implementation of this type of learning would have detrimental effects on students across the country. 
Driverless cars used to be just a dream. Now that we have the technology to make "driverless cars" there seem to be more and more of a concern as to how these cars could be completely driverless. 
You get free breakfeast every morning. There will be eggs,panacakes,bacon,sausage and more. If you join this month you will get a free trip to the next place we go. On the boat there is a pool,and there is a hot tub. The pool and hot tub closes at 10:00. 
Especially in this day and age, many more people are concerned with tending to the specialized needs of kids. The way we learn and develop is being taken a lot more seriously now, and the importance of having the right accomodations for your circumstances is highly enforced. Those that may learn at a lower level or at a slower pace now have the option to not feel judged by the rate that all of their peers are learning at. By being in the comfort of their own home, it could allow them to become more confident in their abilities and achieve more compared to if they were in a standard school. Along with the elimination of judgement, it could also drastically improve their level of thinking as well. There's a huge difference in spending time to focus on the needs of one student as opposed to an entire classroom of students. By isolating an individual, it allows for their educator to identify their strengths and weaknesses which makes the process of helping them a lot less difficult. 
I believe that community service should be required because no doubt that every teacher wants a self-controlled person in their class, I am not saying that every person will be made to be caring or controlled, but they will know that doing those things do pay off when you look back and think at them. Some studies have also showed that helping out does build a self-made person with respect for themselves and others. This will also make the school look good with all the students who do help to create the community better. 
Citizens cars are good to have but all the fines and stress they are putting on us makes us not wont to buy a car. 
What do you think, Is it an alien or is it a natural land form? Facts have proven that it is a natural land form. But all people will never agree if it is an ailen who made it or not. Hopefully this essay proves to you that this face is just a natural land form, but the world might never know. 
YOU are able to vote for the president of your choice, 
an old and out of date method, or a non-democratic way of selecting a presedint that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. and according to Richard A. Posner they maybe right in the arguing view that the Electoral Colleger method is not democratic in a modern sense. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. (Richard A. Posner, 16) 
This all shows exact evidence of how the earth is trying to better themselves to get rid of pollution. Not because they are getting rid of cars, but because they are getting rid of cars and keeping people happy 
I know that in the district handbook said it wouldn't be responsible for any lost items but if you allow kids to bring electronics to school you are making yourself responsible. 
When people think of safety they think of like seatbelts and driving and they don't think that having their phone in their possession while driving might doesn't seem like it would cause a lot of damage but it truly does 
The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. 
I think that not all the students should be required to do the community service 
it can help with having the feeling of assurance that you went with the right decision. 
having the transportation to get to where you need to go in order to be able to help out can be a problem. 
For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. 
Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.          
changing  it from Electroral college to popular is grate idea . 
So let get out and do the work and leave the world the cleanest posable cause i know that we can we have done better thing before. 
In German suburb, this is a "car-free" place, this may seem shocking to many for people who use cars to go where they need to everyday...  Car ownership is only allowed in two places; large parking garages at the edge of development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.  Some say that it's good for the earth due to the bad pollution.  
So should you use your phones while driving I think not. 
Students make life long friends from school: college roommates, kindergarten best friend, or high school sweethearts. Taking away the random dice roll of interactions by lowering the rate at which kids interact would create students with minimal social lives and students more likely to become sad or depressed. Students taking classes from home would loose touch with societal standards and become worse adults by not respecting things like: dress codes, rules of the office, or authority figures. This would be because of the lowered interaction with these rules and could lead to people who aren't mentally tough. Students without friends would become lost in society and could be unable to speak about their situation because of their lack of original social interaction. 
You have a schedule to follow, you have different subjects, and you have a structure. As soon as your morning alarm goes off you start with your morning routine. First you shower and get dressed, next you brush your teeth, then you may get transported to school. At school they provide students with a shedule to follow. You take four classes a day and have eight in total that are seperated with lunch. Each subject has different learning styles and ways to solve problems. Everything is structured and not given to a point you can't sort things out. 
What the author suggests is something thst is really worthy pusuit the danger is presents because Venus could even become the next "Earth" in a near future. 
they would have to pay for gas 
My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn 
When you get stuck on something whether or not it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? If you don't, you really should it can help you make great decisions like, whether or not should you buy that cat or chose that job. 
In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, "The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress. 
You should keep the electoral college throughout history it has helped us in many ways. 
In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his or her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of of "Da Vinci Code"! 
many straight A students wouldn't like this idea either. 
If i were to have a car that drove itself, I'd sleep in the back of my car until i had reached my desination. But if I'm needed to navigate through rough areas then I'd rather drive the whole way to my desination. 
because students will obtain a greater understanding of the material that is being taught 
An idea that you can do is take a vote on how many kids would like to do community service and let them do it. 
Would there only be one rubric?If so how would teachers use one rubric for completly different projects? 
the pollution it causes to the environment 
I think that its the way to vote ,and its worked for so many years why fix it if its hasnt had a problem yet. 
When this all came to take place the first day they let the news out it went viral. People were wanting to know what caused this and how was this caused. When they realesed the news from the NASA they thought the same thing well it had to be aliens. 
home school can cause distraction, worries 
They will have to do work wilhile they want to meet up. 
Where would all this money even come from? We would have to fund it to provide research for a car that doesn't know how to back out of a driveway yet. There has already been 200 million dollars spent on radar a device on a hiltop. So why waste money on something that only goes up to 25 mph and won't even drive if you don't have your hands on the wheel? It seems like driveless really just means assissting. But assissting to who? Obviously not the wallets of the buyers. 
Honestly I do not trust myself enough to create a well thought out project for myself without cutting myself some slack. I would much rather have a teacher give me the assignment and complete it to the best of my abilities. 
Luke has a lot of things to do because it says, He was working two part jobs in a grocery store and a bank his friend Don Reist invited him to go ona Europe on a cattle boat. So you can tell they go on alot of adventures all the time because in the text it says, "It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States annd a month to get to China". Luke and Don are always prepared to go to places because it says, "Katie's farm a boy came to Luke to prepare him for the for hrd work not the dangers at sea and his job was to watch the animals every hour 
That means such as president Romney can have a strong appeal in the south, but he will gain no electoral vote. 
However, the students' overall concensus as to what the work load is would be more congruent with how future classes would perceive it. 
In a worst case scenario the school could get sued by a student getting a white slip, detention, ISS, suspended, or expelled and disagree about doing the wrong thing they did or if they where given it through "hard feelings" between a teacher and a student. 
This is similar to the bullet trains seen throughout Japan that run on magnates. It would also need to be run by some form of renewable energy sources so the best option is electricity and solar power. It would need a computer capable of driving a car in all conditions and that can travel at high speeds. 
Most americns believe that the elcetoral college is unfair and voting has become a waste of their time 
Can we go to a diffrenet planet thats what nasa is trying to figure out 
But still people don't think it is a landfrom. Its a landfrom there is proof that it is. This eassy is going to explain that it is a landfrom 
A drawback to having the technology in the classroom could mean that we could give off the wrong emotions and confuse the computer it self. 
Everyone should read some sourses before making an disision like this. Not just the people voting so that even the people not voting will fully understand why one disision is being made and whyone isnt being made. This one thing can affect the way electing president will be from now on to the future, unless they deside they want to change it again. 
Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. 
Most classes follow a curriculum schedule that the teacher need to follow. Without the teacher giving the project the student might not learn the things required or not learn enough for the curriculum. When I had an online class my online teacher was very good. She provided me with enough guidelines that I was able to learn the material needed for me to pass the class. Having the teacher design the project will make sure that the student learns the material required for the curriculum. 
The students need some of their own freedom.We are already facing being a teenager and school.We need to be able to make a few more decisions in our everyday lives. 
I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school. 
When using the "electoral college" you are not voting for the president but you are voting for a state of electors. 
students wouldn't get a break from school. 
Thousands of web surfers waiting when the image first appeared on a JLP web site,revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument. 
If students are required to complete a summer project, it must be student-designed 
Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives. 
which ever one you get you get more of the same answer and you us that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying "finally that kids gone". 
You help choose your state electors when you vote for presendent because when you vote for your condidute you are actully voting for your condidate's electors. 
The head of the United States government isn't even elected to the standards that we, the American people, hold ourselves to. 
Some of us just don't get how that works. What happen in 2000 have me to think that, maybe there are some sercet's that the us is not telling us, because they dont know  how we are going  to respond.There is probably a lot of things that would get a lot of people in trouble. What happen in the 2000 should open a lot of eyes right now. This world is so crazy today. We are trillion of doolars in debt probably because of the stupid disicions that the electoral college made on that day. 
Whats wrong with the electoral vote some people seem to think its fair and more efficent. 
And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not. 
becuesa if you were haveing a Bad day then it could hlep you have a lot more of a good day then what you haedded like let say you were geting pick on at school 
Everyone has their own opinion about everything, for some people they think that some things that they imagine to be a bad idea, might be very good for economy, or for other issues, some other things that you think is a good idea, might be really bad for the environment, but thats just your opinion, and its okay. There are many thoughts about this subject, which is about the Electoral College. The Electoral College in some cases is a good idea, and in some cases, to some people, its a bad idea. If you do not know what the Electoral College is or means, it is a process consisting of a ceratin selection of electors that vote for President and Vice President in the election, by counting electoral votes by Congress. 
People probably think that it is made by aliens because people don't go to Mars. People that go to Mars have to be very brave and other things too. the camera has taken pictures because it has to have proof that it really does look like a face. I think again that it is just a landform that has been made over the pass years by the gratational pull and Earths winds.       
This is so that the passengers and driver can get to the destination as quickly as possible.At some point, if the only cars that are used are driverless cars, and laws in all states, not just California, Nevada, Florida, and Washington D.C. have caught up with the driverless cars , then the cars will be able to move quicker and safer to the destinations that are programed into the car.The more driverless cars on the road, the faster the destination can be acheived. 
So, in conclusion, this artifact of mars is real. 
As you can tell in the picture there is other rocks surrounding it and it is just like the other rocks, they have shadows and the "Face's" shadow is just more life like. 
The have broken arm or ankle and can't really do anything. Also some are not all there mentally and would probably hurt more than they helped. So then instead of trying to help our town you hurt it because you force unfit students to do service. 
Less accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car polution. 
In conclusion, the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" demonstrates how despite the dangers Venus presents, it is worthy of pursuing. Exploring venus seems like it is almost impossible with all the risks it offers, but the author makes it clear in this article that they disagree. Their use of evidence in their writing to support their belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how well researched their case is. The author used evidence on Venus's relationship to Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the natural curiosity humans have to support their idea. After taking a look at this article, readers know that the points made in "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" were very nicely supported. The author's support made their idea a thought provoking case. 
The number of cons seems to outweigh the pros. Safety is always a big issue to everyone because it is important that everyone is safe at all times. As the world progresses money seems to be more of an issue. Driverless cars are seemingly too expensive to buy in the first place, let alone the price of gas being a taxi service. The convienience of a taxi is always so pleasant until they are unneccisary, like in smaller areas. Personally, the driverless cars just seem to have too many negative qualities to be worth production. 
you gone be sleepin in cabin. 
Majority of the student body at our school doesn't know how to play sports 
I know for a fact that when I need advice for something I ask a couple members of my family so I get more advice. Have you ever needed advice? Well if you haven't good for you, but most people need advice. 
virtual schooling and at-home education are a great good to education systems and should be implemented around the world 
in greece which i thought was reallt speacial was seeing the Acropolis. I also went to venice Italy, a city with streets of water 
Some belive that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for whta they do. Presidents talk about what they are gonna do to help the country and the slate elelctors define what the presidents are gonna do to help out that certain state. Then the people of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should stay around alot longer the system is just rigt for voting. 
People are saying there's a face on mars. This is true, people are also questioning if aliens had put it there, it may just be a historical formation on the earth, reasearches believe it may just be a formation and not created by aliens. People have named this formation the "Face on Mars" it has become to be a very popular sight that people are wanting to see more and more of it. This is so popular that it has been in "Hollywood films, appearded in books, magizines, and even talk shows." 
Summer projets should be teacher-designed 
Venus hasnt always been bad, or dangerous becase it used to be just like Earth. 
"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." 
There are three things I think really make this possible,and they are muscle scanning 
Sometimes when children get kick out of school they do Community Service. 
On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took 
Another way that I feel the popular vote should be the best thing then the Electoral College is that in Source 2:Pharagraph 14, it explains how the Electoral College is unfair,outdated,and irrational 
This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote. 
There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country 
The thing that they do not realize is the fact that they have no proof of NASA "making up" a story like this. 
because some students may not want you to know how they are feeling or what there emtions are, I feel as if some students need the help or may feel, let's say lonely but don't like saying they are so they fake a smile but those are the students who really need someone to know. 
Some people might disagree with me because they think that election by popular vote for the president of the United States would pick the best president for thier country. 
The author talks about how the value of retuning to vanes is important and worth it. 
that C don't mean they are flunking it means that they are in average to play sports, because the GPA you should have to play sports is a 2.5 or above. 
Having a phone is a privilege, children should know that. It is also a responsibility. It teaches kids, like me, to respect your elders in whatever situation God hands them. 
So if you were to allow them only in free time or lunch, then i think that students wouldn't have to bring them out in class. They could just have them in free time. But the more the students cant have them out at all then the more there just going to use them in class, when they are supposed to be learning they will be texting on their phones or on the internet instead. That could make them fail whatever grade their in and have to retake it the next year. 
The author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful.It can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing , and when using the FACS it can probably not show it. 
The selctions I just read contain one common subject:people drive less cars now in the first and second selection both talk about how some neighborhoods ban the use of cars on certian or all days. In the first selection In german suburb, life goes on without cars the author Elisabeth Rosenthal states " 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there." In other words they either had a car but sold it to move or they never had a car to begin with.In selection 2, it talks about how people are not evven allowed to drive cars on certain days of the week. In paragraph 2 the authour says "On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine."The final 2 selections discuss how studies show that people in America are driving less and less as time passes by. 
The students can make it more fun because they know what the enjoy doing over summer or what they would be able to make fun. They would have more of a desire to do it because they made it and because it would be fun and not completely complicated. For example, Generic_Name and her classmates had to do a summer project and their teachers designed the project. Generic_Name and her friends didnt do the project because whenever they got ready to do it together a couple of them got bored with it because it was not fun and the other students did not complete it because it was too complicated for them to do. That is one reason as to why I believe that students should design their own summer projects. 
One of the things that i am against the electoral college is that the voters dont actually vote on the presidental runner up they are actually voting on the state electors that who in turn elect the president 
Lastly, by using the Electoral College, we are avoiding Run-Off Elections 
Have you ever asked your friends for advice on an issue or to help solve a problem? If so, did you take that advice, or throw it to the wind without ever looking back? 
What he means by saying closest is terms like density and size of venus is the same of earth. 
On that note i hope you take this letter into consideration and think about how this could help us in the future.    
While the current "driverless" cars still require some human skills when travelling through complex road conditions, with continuing developement, eventually the accuracy of the computers' driving skills will rival that of human intelligence. This can be predicted by looking at the accuracy and speed of reaction when looking at an automated calculator in comparison to a human arithmatic. As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately 
In paragraph eight, it states, "To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful." 
dont have a teacher 
also I would be very homesick i would miss my family my friends and pets. Also what happens if you crash you you float out to see or get rescued or drown or live on to tell the tale? What would happen to the animals? would THEY drown or THEY float away or They survive or you could get eaten by sharks!Or get impaled by a storms debrie or get very very SICK! or even worse someone kills you. Now I wouldnt want to be on THAT boat. 
While the kids can focus on their studies, they can make a larger and brighter future. 
The Electoral College helps with a certain percentage of people who aren't giving the best decisions on the candidate they are choosing. 
The Electoral college is a way of voting for Presidency. Electors are the people who consist of that. Their are 538 electors. A majority of the 270 votes is required to elect a president, The 23rd amendment of the constitution states that 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The candidate's political party generally choose the electors. The Presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesdaay after the first monday in november. Most of the states have a winner takes all system except Nebraska and maine. After the presidental election, the governer prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment". 
Another example is Moc team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photo. This example shows that by cameras upgrading , we could see more closly and more clearer. 
one of the reasons why it is a bad idea is because if the GPA on sports is raised, some of the kids that may have lower grades in school, they might think that having good of grades like that might be not worth it to play a sport causing the numbers to possibly decrease. 
and we saw the face change with no alien near by changing it and not cause of the camera but because this natural landform is getting older and soon you won't ever be able to tell it was there. There will be other natural landforms and might look like a face 
If you seek advice from many people, and most or all of those people are saying the same thing, then the choice becomes much more clear. For example, if you're debating wether or not to take all honors next year, and all of your teachers are telling you you should do honors, then the choice to take all honors becomes clear. Seeking advice from only one person might not make your mind up as quickly as talking to many people. Having one of your teachers telling you to do all honors might not be as impactful as having most of your teachers telling you to do all honors. 
well that is all i have to say principal.            
There are no such things as aliens, and if there are such things as aliens we should just leave them alone. 
that we don't have segergation in the state. 
It might be fun, it might be cool, but is it's not safe. Not only would driverless cars be dangerous themselves 
In a new modern classroom setting, students should have the liberty to design their own summer projects 
In many states throughout an election preiod (the period in which candidates move to diferent states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. 
students should be able to do what they want after school. 
These photos were taken in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. People thought that the formations were from other living things that are on Mars. Nasa took several pictures of these rock formations because they were shaped like humans. The rock formations starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even ended up in haunted grocery store checkot lines for 25 years. 
Classroom environments are successful because they are flexible in that teachers can alter their teaching styles to best suit the needs of their students. 
The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occuring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people. 
To change the way something has been done for such a long time would be like asking to distroy something and rebiuld it all the way back from the begining. 
Principal I think I've made my point clear. Are youth should have to perform community service. It wouldn't take away all our free time and it would help our community in so many ways. 
If you force students into doing something they would not enjoy they may not care for it as they did not want to do it in the first place, so the extra curriculum would be pointless by most students and would be usless for the school to do these and this could also be a waste of student time as if this plan fails this could potentialy be a waste of school resources and school time, with the exception of football the other two activitys will fail. 
The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. 
This is how our founding fathers stated this country and thats how it need to be our country has the best presedent that we could have in this type of situation because he is a colored man and there is nothing wrong with that. If we did not have an electoral collage it would be harded to keep things in line such as how the voting works and how it should be decided that we have the best presedent we can get at that time for our country. As an example we have been fighting on Iran and alfaganastan for a long time and presedent oboma did the best he could with the best that he had to make sure that we were still a free country and the we were safe from terrorism. The electoral collage was a good iead and still is so thst way we do always have a good presedent or for anything that this country need to vote on it always keeps thing in order and fair to this country so there for it is what this country need in order to make the best we can with the best we got.    
At this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. 
I completely disagree with your proposed policy change that if passed would not allow students to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B minimum average. This policy would be unfair to students. 
The Martian mesa just not had a head it also had a mouth,eyes, and a nose like a real human will have. Since the spacecraft discover it. It came out in books,magazines, and radio talk shows. Some people say that there might be life on Mars. The author engage the public to know and attract attention to Mars. For this disover from the spacecraft and the scientist it was hard work to discover Mars Global. The lava dome that is form like a isolated mesa it is the same height as the Face on Mars. 
Moreover, you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. 
However, the decrease in the amount of problems and page length will only urge students to complete the packet instead of copying. 
So they want to help you out more and they want you to talk your problems out with them so they can know what is going on and what they are going to do. When a friend is helping you out they want to give you good advice so you do not have to worry and the situation again. When you ask multiple people for advice it is good because they want to help with the situation that you need hep with, they want you do what is best for you, and the person might not want you to get hurt because they might have been in that situation already. 
In conclusion, the popular vote system is all around a bad idea and it would cause nothing but bad times. Keep the voting system the same because everyone seem's to like it so dont fix it if it's not broken. That is why we should not change or fix the voting system in America.    
In the ninth paragraph of the article, it says, "...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?" There would be too much confusion for the lawmakers and everyone else if there was an accident because although the manufacturers made the car, there was still a driver in the driver's seat, so who is to blame? This would cause a lot of conflict in court cases if there were accidents and someone was to be sued. 
People all over the world use cars to drive to work or take their children to school. To most people, the automobile is an everyday part of life. But there are downsides to the extreme usage of cars. Some people are noting this trend and are begining to limit their car usage. 
When the elector votes for their prefered president, all the votes used on that elector counts for the president. Instead of going through this whole process, would'nt it be less of a struggle to just have citizens vote for the president of their choice and win by popular votes? Also stated in source 2 "Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes." This shows how the Electoral College is difficult to understand for some people. The Unites States consists of many people who come from other counrties and speak other languages. This makes it even more complicated for some to understand even if the process is translated, and just by eliminating this process, it could make Presidential elections less complicated. 
hey concluded that these smart cars chould work really wel for peole one day. The only thing is that u whould have to watch the road just to make sure everything is going okay. Without the idea of smart roads you whouldnt have smart cars .The cars basicly are smart cars because of the smart roads. The car has many senors in and outside oif the car to help it drive by its self 
Some Students and teachers might not prefer online video conferencing and might not feel comfortable speaking or showing their faces online. Distance learning can be a hard for students that travel to different areas around the world,internet can be a problem because some countries don't have internet connection or they have bad connection. 
Homeschooling is a good source of eduaction, but I think that a school eduaction from a public or private school is better than doing it from home or online. 
A student's schoolwork, and social life should be kept individually.After school activities is a great chance for students to relieve stress with schoolwork, and let students to do something outside of school that they really enjoy doing.Students shouldn't have to focus on school all the time because other activities are just as important in helping a student grow. 
If it was my opinion I would not have cell phones in my pocket so i can call my mom when i get to school otherwise you do not need your phone to text during school hours. 
To sum up, seeking advice from multiple pterodactyls - I mean people, can give you better and more honest feedback, and can help you decide for yourself. So don't be afraid to ask for opinions because in the end it might just help you soar 
The author does not support her claim that Venus is worth studying despite the dangers it presents 
Our founding fathers feared democracy, and the is why they came up with this process. 
The face is an illusion, you have to catch it at the right angle because if you catch it at another angle you ont be able to see it. 
you can get more diverse and varying opinions 
They tend to pay more attensiion to themselves but not others. They do it for the money and the fact to usually get other people upset. The presidents that the Electoral Collage want to win they win. Its a fact that most presidents win to easy. They win with a plethora of help, not only with the U.S but with the members of the Electoral Collage. 
This free time is also beneficial to students as it is an opportunity for them to explore career choices and other things that interest them. Free time gives these students a chance to be involved in the community more through different things such as volunteering, having a job, working for an internship, and so much more. For example, one online student I know likes to volunteer at the animal shelter when she can because she wants to become a veterinarian. Her free time allows for her to learn more information and develop the skills for what she wants in the future. It sets kids up for success rather than failure by allowing them to find interests in high school rather than switching subjects every year in college. This free time lets them create a more lasting impact on their community while also finding out more about the real world and what it hold for students when they graduate. 
You might even have you parents come out and watch, just be helping out a little can make a big difference. 
These are my reasons why I agree with my principal.  
When I first got out of highschool, I did not think that I would be working two part-time jobs. Or be so busy all of the sudden, the jobs were so boring, it was time for a change.Then my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Eurpoe on a cattle boat. I couldn't deny it; this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
A dungeons and Dragons game along with all of the books and die is over 200 dollars, now imagining multiplying that by 7 just to afford the basics for the club. The robotics team pays around 600 dollars for each robot, and more for the competitions, now that program has to buy 15 robots and buy more slots at the competitions. If some how the schools were able to afford these expensive along with all other clubs, teachers, and staff salaries it would come from our local taxes. This would double our local taxes, but if the schools decide not to over tax the citizens of Generic_School than there would be no way the school could provide the gear and equipment for the school's clubs and teams. My school's sports gear is already worn out and our schools are in dire need of new equipment, but there is no way we could spend 7 times as much just to give everyone more cheap and basic equipment. 
The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" it says that, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." 
it gives them a chance to show their creativity, 
The disturbance of a notification on the phone has been the cause of man accidents and deaths caused by car wrecks. Statistics show 6 out of 10 teenegers have been in car crashes due to distracted driving. In the text located on www.teensafe.com it shares the story of 25 year old Natasha Boggs of Ohio and how texting and driving affected her life and others. It states " Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving."The article also tells the story of 20 year old Dillon Jackson a pickup truck driver that was distracted by his cell phone which took other innocent lives. The text states "A driver of a pickup truck killed a whopping 13 individuals in a Texas crash in the spring of 2017. 20-year-old Jack Dillon Young was behind the wheel of his truck and was texting while driving, causing him to cross the center line several times."This informs you on how cell phone distraction could risk the lives of not only yourself but others as well. ? people are injured or killed due to cell phone distraction. Cell phone disturbances have a big impact on car crashes and deaths. 
The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. 
I do understand that there are students who just don't understand the work, 
It's against direct elections that are spurious 
In article it says," Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it way well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. 
Most people know that in this time the technology are the most important thing, therefore, it is possible do not be physical present in a classroom but can listening and see live class, basically the video conferencing 
Extracurricular activities are a great way to do something you enjoy. 
Overall, this article about Venus is less than "stellar". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up. All in all, the author does not support their idea the best. 
it allows students who are not comfortable or focused at school to work diligently from an undisturbed and comfortable situation from their homes 
The average student, plays sports or does extracurricular activities, making their schedule more difficult. Online school would provide students with a more flexible schedule. Students would also be able to do and try new things outside of the classroom. Activities keep students engaged, making them want to learn. This also makes learning more fun and helps students further their learning. The less stress students have the more successful they'll be. Students can't have fun with what they're learning if they're stressed. Having a lot of stressful causes students to not do well in school. For some students, stress can be helpful, but for the average high school student stress isn't beneficial and cause more issues for students. Students should be able to have fun and enjoy their learning for their benefit. 
If you decide policy one you might have complaints about cell phones ringing during the middle of class 
In the article, it says " we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day". 
Caring for the animals while crossing the oceans kept me busy. I had to feed and water them three times a day. I also had to claen out the stalls. 
I use to think they were real and then I figured out they weren't. If they was real then when people or NASA went to a planet or just into space, why didn't those people every see them? If they did exist why wouldn't people take pictures when they were in space of the aliens? Why don't aliens exist? 
I think that as long as they aren't using them in class it should be alright to have it with them. 
With the Electoral College we wouldn't be able to voice our opinion as because as Source 2 explains that if you have Electoral College system the voters would vote for a slate of electors, but not for president. The state of electors would be the ones to elect the president. Therefore the people wouldnt get a voice to vote only the 29 people in Florida-shown on the map in source 3-not the whole state which makes it not an equal oppurtinuty to everyone who lives in that state. 
In the passage "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto. 
So some people may hate the process, but its because of winner-takes-all system. 
Texting while driving is in the 21st century has changed the way of driving nowadays while technology keeps on advancing the problems gets bigger and bigger and while the death rate would keep on increasing as time goes until everyone fix the texting while driving problems continues.   
You can avoid texting while driving by texting before you drive. You can avoid texting while driving by texting before you drive. Henceforth, having safe driving habits all start with keeping both hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and mind focused on what's happening. Moreover, texting and driving may have a reachable desire but there is a solution by placing your phone out of reach. Above all, placing your phone out of reach helps you pay attention to driving instead of wondering what your messages says. Additionally, to prevent texting while driving simply ignore your phone by turning it off. Drivers safety websites notes to turn off your cell phone. Let your voicemail capture your voice and text messages. In summary turning your cell phone off will prevent any possible accidents making a safe environment. 
The electoral college does alsonot work because it was created by our founding fathers. 
If they had the police that phones could be used during nutrition and lunch a lot more kids would like that. 
it helps those who learn better in a small environment, 
Usually when students get home from school, they use their time being on their phone or playing video games. When they go to an after school activity, they use some of their free time constructively. If the student went to the sports club, then they would get more physical exercise. If the student does yearbook, then they get to learn about different activities going on throughout the school. If the student participates in the student council, then that student gets to help the community through service projects. All of those clubs provide better use of the students time, rather than just sitting at home doing nothing. If the students actually enjoy cutting back on devices, then would try to manage their time so they are staying away from screens and doing something that is stimulative. 
You are about to make a deciding between whether to make your student.Perform community service . to whatever decision you make you will always have your good and bad reaction. So know whatever you pick people going have a opinion. Now i am going give to difference reason on both sides. 
In source #2,The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradford Plumer , says, " Prehaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. " Who wants that? What's it even worth voting then if your vote, your vote on the leader of America gets put into the hands of the House Of Representatives to decide on. Think about it. 
What do I mean by "safe space?"A safe space is where people can share how they feel, and why they feel that way. An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you. It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over. Teammates also tend to build you up, and give a boost in confidence which can help you be a stronger person. Did you know that having fun with your friends and participating in the activities you enjoy can even help you get into college? 
. I feel like we should amd should be able to study Venus from a close range. I think the dangers can be overcomed with lots of training and simulations that are inspried by Venus's harsh condistions. I also belive that we can survie venus with good technology. 
In my personal oppinion I think it's best to keep the Electoral College. 
by having your children participate in extra curricular activities, the experiences that were gained, would be so rewarding in the end for growing children. In my opinion extracurricular activities are great places for children to discover who they are, what they like, what they want to be when they grow up and so much more. 
Receiving multiple opinions from different people can help out a lot. Sometimes when people ask for advice, they don't always want to follow that specific person's advice. This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people. 
Should people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well. 
that does not mean that only because they have a c average that would not let them enjoy their sports or other activities unless they've a B average. 
I think you should leave it like how it is because nobody gets to over come power. Everyone in the electoral system have the same amount of power. 
My opinion is that we should study venus. 
Being able to pick your own project is such a better experience because you will be learning new things. 
For one,professional slate of electors can be trusted to vote for the party's nominee. 
you can have many adventures. 
On the other side of the fence there are some people that believe that they are very studious and would never have a problem like this. 
Some people would say is sending that 1 small text important that causing your life or that other person life 
More people say that no have a problem if have or no have a President or Vice president,this is no good because a President take decission importants and the Vice President help to President to take this decission. For this have take good decission in the moment of the vote. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
some students try very hard in school but don't have good grades 
if you don't plays any sports you will get lazy and you will not have any energy to do stuff with your friends 
There may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons I thought of were the most important to me. With extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. Also, extracurricular activities can play a important role in life by leading you to a career. For the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that It's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it!  
not wasting their vacation time, 
That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like "The Martian" and books like "The Lunar Chronicles". A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe. 
I believe that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity 
Going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. 
Writing and essay in school can be very stressful and difficult. But you can help someone in school by giving them advice on a essay that they're stressed about or maybe just need some help. Another is taking a test, taking a test is very nerve racking and scary but all you might need to do is just relax take a deep breath and talk to someone and just stay positive. Games in school are fun but someone may need help with a question to get the answer right. If anyone might need help maybe just go over it with them and re-read it so that maybe they can understand and get it quicker, and get the answer right 
In addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. Finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams. 
Students can get benefit from being able to attend class from home 
Scientist figure it's a Martian mesa 
The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. 
After all, many students will greduate and keep going with their life without having any problem about jobs and they will be good economically. They also will give their childs a reason why they should go to school and follow their dreams without letting people to punish their dreams. It also will help their family to support them without caring about what other people says, but everyone should conserve good things about everything. Also this students will have an illustrate part of his life, where they are going from success to success keeping everything on the side but his dreams on the front.         
In conclusions, I think that changing to the popular vote instead of keeping the Electoral College would be the best thing for the united states. Everyones vote will count, it would be fair, and more people would pay attention to the elections and vote. Like Bob Dole said, "Abolish the Electoral College!" 
With most of the kid with C' s the school may not have any events for kids to try out for. With that the coach might not have time to try out the kids for the team. some coaches might not even let the kid try out. 
Do you really think the electoral college should stay? The second source states that Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Does that make any sence to you? That even though the majority votes on one thing but they dont get that in a democracy? 
Students who are able to design their own projects can create projects they are interested in completing, leading to a more engaging learning experience. 
The president should be chosen fairly by a just and unbiased vote cast by the people of the united states. 
Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting 
they can help you meet and befriend new people 
be cause people can vote on electors and  not the actual presedent they want to win for the vote because people think he or she may or may not be the best person to be for that job we should keep the electoral college for reasons like not haveing to pick or choose for the  better person. To be if the both want kinda the same thing,it would help the people not the presedent it only gets them votes and votes are nouthing to me or others. 
have different experiences, 
So i look at the picture real closley and i also look at what i see in the back grown and i see all the little holes that are there 
Electoral College should be removed by the government and just have popular vote be responisble. 
taking classes online could be tremendously beneficial in the daily life of a student, 
Which the state legislature are responsible for picking electors..... and the electors would/could always defy the will of the poeple. 
Next they will have a look on what jobs are going to be like 
When you use your car people are making money. People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive.If you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter car     
Summer assignments can be very beneficial in ensuring that students are continuously learning, but the question at hand is, should students personalize their summer assignments or should a teacher-designed standardized copy be given to every student? 
I understand that you want us to do community service, but some people just don't have time to do things like that 
Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one. If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is. 
my question to the auther would be , "Doesnt Mars have rocks and mountens? So, can mars be a sister planet to Earth as well or am I wrong?" 
in balances political weight throughout. 
These qoutes from bradford plumber, explain that half of the peoples votes were going to wrong canidates as the pepole were completley confused about who they were even voting for. 
The Mona Lisa picture is intended to make somebody smile but it only shows what the computer can do 
Furthermore the Electoral College is the stupides thing I ever heard of and i think we should get rid of it 
What is wrong with the yearbook. What are they going to do with the yearbook because all you have to do is set the students that took there picture in alphabetical order. What will they do when there done with It.There not going to let a lot of people do it because you don't need half the school. Plus It's going to be hard if everyone wants to do the yearbooks. 
To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The bookSpeak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do. 
it is an easy method of choosing the candidate that the people want to have for four years guiding taking care of the Precidency 
Cleaning the road isn't the only form of community service. If people don't want to get dirty, the they can go help tutor kids, or read at the library. They can go to the homeless shelter or Faith Missions and help organize or feed people. They can come up to the school and help my dad, the janitor, clean the school. There is many things other than cleaning the road that they can do. 
In conclusion, the most important thing is that all of us have an opportunity for success, and whether one gets there online or on-site shouldn't matter. Everyone's situations aren't the same, and so each individual one should always be considered, not compared to others. Advancement of technology has helped many people all over the world, regarding education. The ability to receive an adequate one is essential for one's success and benefits the many people who don't have access to it. This not only includes K-12, but post-secondary education as well, as online degrees and certifcations are continously being introduced. 
The sense of community and common interest in a large group of people can really make you feel at home and be a nice thing to look forward to after a long day of school, even if it might be taxing physically or mentally. In anything extracurricular everyone knows everyone, they're all friends united by a common passion and a common goal. This builds strong compromising skills and cooperative skills. 
In my opinion I say that people should not use their cell phone while driving. 
Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  
We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by. Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on. No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours. This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned. 
There's research on from the past that from long ago "Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth." There's other features that Venus similar to earth. "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." 
I reconsider that are principal should let us eight graders bring are cell phones to school and allow us to use them at all time except during class. 
This letter is concerning your considerations of implementing the policy of requiring school sports players to maintain a B average (3.0 GPA) in order to play their respective sport. 
the electoral college is a very important process that goes on in this world just to make our place a better one . If our electoral college do better we can have more oppertunities in life, like when the good president becomes president just like obama , He can do good things with the taxes or even make it easier for kids to have jobs so they wont have to be on the streets doing bad things and maybe even one day they would grow up to be able to vote for thier favoritem president. 
When you vote along with everyong else i think that the majority of the votes should get that presedent instead of everyone voteing and then it getting sent to the electoral college and them getting to pick who they want wich i dont think is right i think that the people should pick who they want by the votes. 
Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. 
Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study , despite it's proximity to us 
So I think all students should perform community service so we have an excellent environment, and more people can look at teens, and not think of them as a bad reputation like adults do right now. They think of some teens as trouble, bratty, and they don't do anything. But other teens are getting looked up to by doing different amounts of work to help out, and also adults think they are a good reputation since they help out more. 
because I think I will become dectration to kids because they will want to play with it to see her they feel. This type of technology should be use for treapist to help read patient when they are talk about their life so the treapist know how they felt about that part in there life. 
Most student disagree with me because they say that it isn't their responsibility to pick up after someone else. 
Next, the author gives possible ways to study Venus safely, and effciently. 
The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, " even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements." If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art. 
When we need help we will know that our neighbor or classmate will be there to help us and will take care of us. When we are older, the younger kids we showed all those virtues, will keep passing them to their family, friends. Soon we will see all the great things we achieved. 
Some thimk that this is pure evidence of life on Mars 
This takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. Now this does not guarantee the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful. 
I disagree for many reasons. 
For conclusion, there are a lot of dangers and obstacles that the astronauts need to prepare for if the astronauts want to accomplish the challeneg to explore Venus. The author supports the idea of taking the challenge to Venus by stating that the planet is worth studying for regardless of what dangerspursue them. 
Hi, this is one of a student from the SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to talk about the policies our school is having. The policy that i will be talking about is the cell phone policy. 
If it was an object created by aliens then why would they turn that landform into a human face. There have never been any reports of someone coming close to an alien face to face. Also how would the aliens know what humans look like, they have never even been to earth before 
and that calls for the better and more advanced technology that the people have brought to us, that our nation shall continue only to improve--and cars would be one of them.    
mandating that students participate in after school activities could improve kids' work ethic. 
there are advantages to limited car usage because of many different acts of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia a program is set to spread to other countries. It was called a "Car Free" day which meant that you could not use your car for a whole day. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the  streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. 
What I need are some people that care to do some of the community service 
Now you know at least one student wants it. 
When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, 
I was informed of your latest decision on a new school policy, being a student at the school that it would effect, I believe it is my duty and right to pose my opinion. You suggested that all students that wish to participate in sports or other school related activities must obtain at least a B average. 
its way easier to detect peoples emotions instead of just guessing or thinking you know how they feel. They shouldn't have a problem trying to make the place better. 
Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. 
I dont think you should abolish the electoral college, after all its not so bad.  You should just do better and get all around the United States not just a couple of states, ALL!! 
I think community service is a very good and helpful thing for the community, but I do not think students should be required to do community service. 
There are many people using phones to communicate with one and the other or taking pictures to post on social media. 
I think the Electoral college shall stay put. 
Many people have very good decision making skills and help from those people can help you evaluate your decision and help you make a final decision. 
other people may have more experience with the topic, 
Also in paragrpah two it says that Venus and Earth are "twin". 
Then in that case the school will provide transportation from the school to the students bus stop 
it can kill people and its bad that it happens 
Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. 
This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting. 
Having an open mind is when someone is able to take other people's opinions and instead of judging it they try to understand it. I believe people who ask for multiple opinions are very open minded and are willing to listen to other people's perspective besides their own. In conclusion, it is always important to keep an open mind when asking other people for their opinions or advice. 
Using this to help the teacher is alright. 
why make them do something that they wont even enjoy . I f the students don't enjoy what their doing then they wont understand the lesson that they are suppose to learn from the experience. 
Sports and other after school activities take a lot of time and commitment, and leave participants with much less time to study. 
gives equal oppourtunity to smaller states. 
Can the software upgrade? The students will proabley try to make it better. 
it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate. 
for the greatness that it would bring to our community 
Instead of them rules I think they should make a better rule. So we don't have to dress for gym or something at least like that 
I acknowledge that some students are irresponsible. 
the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democractiv method of selecting a president. 
In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity, and they will increase the amount of students who complete them. Giving students something they can choose will ultimately increase students work ethic and view of school. 
I think the use of the Facial Action Coding System is a well needed thing for schools 
So, in the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. 
Lets say there is a tie. Then every state would have only 1 vote meaning the little state of Delaware would have as much say as the huge state of California. This example is the complete opposite of doing what the people want.This means the 35 million people have as much say as the 500,000 or sol in Delaware. 
getting a B average can be hard to do sometimes 
Another one could be that they just don't find it appealing and they can start lacking in it and not helping out in anyway. 
People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot people taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad. 
Although it did happen once in the year 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was since 1888 
I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity 
Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn't know when the work they have done is enough 
At the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a Driverless Car will be one of them. So be smart and purchase one at your own risk. 
The Author explains that "Today, Venus still some features that are analogous to those on Earth" (4). Analogous means the outside has changed but the inside or function are similiar to that pf something else. If Venus still has valleys and mountains similiar to the of Earth then if we studied those features we could find out what happened to Venus decades ago. 
Why would NASA hide groundbreaking news like this? "Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was anceint civilazation on Mars."So why would NASA hide news like this, that would help advance space exploration? 
The author does not care what kind of dangers there is because he thinks Venus is a planet that is worth to study. As he tries to get a closer look at. NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves. Although the challenges that they have read, seen, or have heard kept stopping them from figuring out how to get closer to Venus. However, they did not give up because they kept looking for other ways to explore Venus. 
The should favor in changing th election by popular vote since the electoral college is practical. It is practical because they avoid problems in the election. 
"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Thats a good question an I say that because what if the car does get in a accident who can the other person blame? The driver or the car it self? Im sure that the other person is going to blame the driver because the driver should of been paying attention despite if the car was in autopilot or not. 
With online learning, attendance will no longer be a problem schools are forced to address. 
Many schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Sometime,the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is advantage and disadvantage. 
they can still cause an accident 
Another person who illustrates this is my same friend Generic_Name, who had a demanding part time job at a cafe during the morning of school weekdays in order to finacially support her family. Since she took her academic courses online, she was able to have a flexible shift and work for longer hours because there was no given time that she had to be present in class. If she had not been doing school through online means, it would not have been possible for her to take on the job at an hour where most students are actively learning in school. 
He mentions, "...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is. 
In Bogota, Colombia, home to 7 million, has a "program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city errily devioid of traffic jams." According to source 3, byAndrew Selsky.It has been three straight years that cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted 
and they are more likely to get easily distracted when learning from home. 
Voters can't neccessarily control who their electors vote for, you may vote for a certain slate of electors but they may still go ahead and vote for someone else. Sometimes voters get confused and may vote for a slate of electors who are for the wrong candidate. For example, in 1960 segragationists in the Louisiana Legislature almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually go to him. Although these things dont happen all time their is always the possibility and why take that chance on such an important event, choosing our president the person who will lead our country. 
Despite the many bonuses that distance learning offers, there is something that can be said about the social aspect of traditional public schooling. By forcing students to interact with one another, traditional schools facilitate social interactions between peers. 
The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars. 
Students should chose when and to who they reveal their emotions, and this system deprives them of that freedom. 
keep the child engaged 
I highly recomind keping the Electoral college. 
As stated by the Governors Highway Safety Association, 47 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia have outlawed texting and driving.As a consequence, violating the law can result in a large fine and even facing prison time depending on the state. The laws showed some form of effectiveness as the rate of traffic deaths among adults decreased. 
The people dont really get to choose who they believe should be in office. All the electoral college does is get in the way of whom the people choose to be president. The electoral college should be removed and replaced with popular vote. This should take place as soon as possible. 
So your getting back some of what you put in, it is a win win situation 
However, It cost a lot of money. 
Also the electoral college system makes sure there are no run-off elections 
In schools, there are counselors, coaches, teachers, and friends who can identify if a student is not doing well and get them the help they need. Without interacting in person, it is hard to tell if a student is struggling and in need of help. This type of attention could be the difference between life or death in extreme cases, and should not be overlooked. In fact, more and more schools are placing a greater emphasis on mental illness and stress. Schools often encourage students to engage in de-stressing activities such as yoga, meditation, or sports. Because the focus of distance learning is purely learning, there is no emphasis on the well-being of students, a practice that could lead to detri mental consequences for students in the long-run. 
The first thing is that everybody should be able to vote the second time not just ten people from each state. If those five outta ten people choose the same then that state wont count and thats not fair at all. Some of the people outta the ten that were chosen either didn't vote the first time or they have no idea what they are doing what so ever and they could possibly mess up the system or they could mess up the votes. 
Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. InSource 2 "The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"backs up my response when stating,"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...". That to me my friend, is not fair at all. 
In conclusion the software should be implemented in todays classrooms .Althoughyour home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile. 
we would have even more money added to that debt to try to prevent it from happening again and no one really knows spending all that money would even prevent it from malfunctioning again, and lastly we would have some very unhappy customers on our hands.We could be talking riots, people wanting their money back, shootings, killing. 
The use of this technology to reaf the emotioanl expressions of students in a classroom is valuble. 
I think you should make community service an option to the students because I think it seems like a fantastic idea.Its a fantastic idea because it make the school look good as long with the community. 
People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc. 
In the text its states that "It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president." 
Overall, attend classes from by way of online make students confused 
If you don't know none of these details you can search stuff online. 
New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others 
Though there are many negatives, the reader understands that there are positives. Using less gas would be extremely nice and would help economy. If driverless cars got to the point where it was only public and no one bought cars, then money would be saved by all. And, with the sensors, the car can drive very well on its own and it is at a very good point right now. 
These five reasons have something to deal with Electoral College. Is just some arguments that they have of electoral college, in of defense of the electoral college. 
I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
The electoral college also has some good reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. 
the best way to do that is to keep our phones away keeping your phone is smart while driving because texting and driving is a big no-no in everyone else's eyes. The only reason why I think people need to follow this is because I've driven with people who have sat at the light because they were stuck on their phones and I had to tell them to drive so, to be honest, we need to limit ourselves to do it only when are stopped in traffic or we just parked up somewhere. 
Talking to different people who has went through the same or they are going through what your going through they can give you advice like what not to do and what you should do. 
These are some of the reasons why i think it is a good idea that we should limit the usage in this world because there are so many pro's and cons on why its a good/bad idea.    
Each party representing the state selects the "trusted" people for each state 
Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. 
when talking about this stuff you need think logical but in end it all add up to everyone else discussion. 
teachers can integrate what they will teach 
Allowing individuals to make their own projects means they will have the freedom to design the project how they see fit; 
Getting advice from multiple people is helpful in the decision making process for a better decision. 
Its 1983, the stickiness of your fingers still reminisce the apricot you ate earlier while the beating sun destroys the meaning for sunglasses. The thought of eighty-seven more days stuck in your families summer house somewhere in Northern Italy with nothing but books, music, and your bike makes the thought of going back to school almost exciting. While you lay on your chair that afternoon, you remember that your previous History teacher assigned a project on "The Roaring Twenties". To be true, homework did not seem the most appealing activity to accomplish during that hot summer day, never the less, you were meaning to get up and wash your filthy hands of apricot juice. The project consisted of a writing assignment and a piece of self-made artwork. While the assignment felt like it would take all summer to accomplish, all of your previous knowledge kept flooding back like school was just yesterday. With no library within a three-mile radius, there was no need. Your project was finished within a week and the rest of your summer was dedicated to lounging beside the lake near your house and your grandfathers old books he left behind dating back to the early 1900's. 
This would make students grades improve and allow them to have a better oppurtunity in the real world. Occording to the text, the technology would also allow "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This means the technology could adjust itself to learn how the student works, instead of the other way around. Also "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," meaning that the technology would work for each student around the world. 
By a show of hands who likes summer... because i sure do. Shouldnt summer be a time spent learning or accomplishing other activitys like learning to drive, learning to bake or even learning to maintain a source of income. 
Me personally think it's fine just the way it is,why because "I think the electoral process is a better solution 
the electors  college is unfair to voters .because of the winner take all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances of winning . 
Students strongly dislike summer assignments. It is a known fact, and completing them is the last thing on a child's agenda. One thing students do enjoy, is choosing everything themselves. Teacher's have a dramatic affect on a student's learning, most of the time being beneficial, but students tend to procrastinate on assignments that require a large amount of effort to work on. 
Three years later, NASA proved our skeptical theorists wrong again. 
Having someone to talk to is very important for advice but just making better decisions from having multiple peoples advice is just as important.The final reason is making better decisions, making better decisions can impact your life majorly 
Even though the electoral college is a pretty bad thing, there are still a few upsides. The Electoral college avoids te problem of neither candidates getting a majority of the votes. 
The good thing about asking one person is you don't have to really worry about them going around telling that much people about your problem 
The other thing about the electorial vote is that who are the electors? who picks them? 
Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what. To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped. 
Today I am here to share with you that scientificly it is just a natural landform. 
You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out. 
The manufacturers have thought of a way to allow the car to drive and think for itself and allowing the driver to relax until they get notified that they should take control. Cars that are smarter will allow you to save more money and cost less mechanically, as well as save on fuel. 
To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students. 
It isn't right if a president wins the popular votes but doesn't win by electoral votes and it results in him/her not becoming president. If someone votes for a slate of electors and they end up not even voting for who they're "supposed" to be voting for then what's the purpose of electing them anyway? There is no purpose unless you want the other party to win which i highly doubt that. The electoral college affects the voting of states because if the majority of their state is republicans and they're democratic, there vote isn't really going to matter because majority wins. This process makes no sense to me. 
When making a big, important choice, people, especially young adults and teens, should seek more than one person's opinion. People could have different past experience with lots of things and might help people decide when making an important choice. People should seek more than one opinion when making an important choice 
Extracurricular activities can improve many students lifestyles. 
There is something good to it. It can make them try new stuff. 
Nowaday, it's kind of hard to find that technology so i hope that the scientist can make one for the teacher. 
because they could take away the focus of the driver, 
I think that the author describes how technolgoy called Facial Action Coding System enables computer to idntify human emotions and expressions of the students in the classroom are valuable. 
Like in 2012 when obama and romney were running obama won because he new that people want a winner take all basis. Obama got 61% of electorla votes and Romney got 51%.Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winners take all basis the state creates a landslide electoral vot victory in that state. 
The " Unmasking the Face on Mars" was NOT created by Aliens. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. 
Sometimes it is better to have multiple people state their opinion before you make a big decision 
Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. 
the Electoral College is very old and unfair 
But the Electoral College also have rules in this article by Richard Posner "The Electoral College reguires a presidential candidate to have no tran-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect President." 
For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. 
When completing homework or classwork in which students must research to learn what the next unit will entail allows students a chance to learn more than what is required and provides students the ability to learn even before the information is taught. 
i think you should just keep it the same 
"PLEASE READ WITH CAUTION!". 
In Conclusion,so today I talked about why we the people need an electoral college and there are many reasons for it. To sum it all up the reasons we need an electoral college is becasue the electors helps us by picking a president,vice president,and the electoral votes that we need. Another is because we have 538 electors that help pick a president. Last is that they give the U.S a president. So this are some of the reasons why we the people need an electoral college.    
Many people believe that " the Face" on Mars is actually a alien of some sort or a human. I can truly convince you why it's not a alien, it's only a landform. I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. 
I will be trying to convince the population to beleive that the face's on Mars are natural landforms. 
I am a scientist at NASA my name is Jeff. There is a face on mars and people think its by aliens well I know its not by aliens. 
For at least two months or one month that would like be so much fun and get cheerleaders to represent our team and school. iam just putting ideas out there for you 
First off i would like to tell you what a electoral college is 
Although it does look like a human face theres no body connected to it unless the body is stuck underneath the surface of the planet, but through my research I insist it's an alien. I do not have proof it is one but theres no proof of it being a human either. When the Mars Orbiter Camera went around Mars the face still had no evidence if it was either a human face or an alien artifact. 
Second, they explain how it affects us in our ordinary way of living. 
Abolishing the Electoral college should be the right thing to do.  
I do not believe that FACS is important for the students to learn about. 
Has the face on mars been put there by alien? Well statments say that aliens have came and put this face on mars. 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
The author supports this idea in the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" by the similarites to earth making the dangers worth while 
In my opinion i think we should change voting to popular vote. The reason why is because the governmennt sometimes performs certain actions that they think is good for the people when at the end of it its really not its just for the government to get more money. 
because then parent would be complaining how it is not fair for a teacher or students to know her sons/daughters expression. 
On the other hand the electoral college should not be taken away because our founding fathers established it. 
The first reasoning that the author has is that way back when, Venus might have had open oceans and could have supported various forms of life. 
Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in case you did not know. 
Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. 
Distance learning should not be an option for all students 
I feel that are state would benefit in a positive way with the way that popular vote is set up. looking at the  past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. 
The problem will not always function around critical conditions, because there are college students who take online classes and 99% of them are doing fine. Some people do not learn better online and some do but, that's fine because taking online classes are not by force, and students have the right to choose what can help them learn. 
In Conclusion, Electoral College is a well-known thing when to choose a president or vice president or even governer 
The author struggles to explain the advantages of what will happen if NASA explores Venus. It is close to impossible with the technology out right now for NASA to be able to explore Venus. 
This states it unually is common around Mars. People think it is just a landform. In the article it says it is hard to find the face. Everyone seemed excited they found the face on Mars! 
Then when it comes time to fairly make their votes for us,the people who voted ,They can change their minds if they like an vote for the least liked canidate running for office by Florida is they wanted too! Thats ridicoulous and has no justice.The winner takes all system is very faulty and unfair. 
Now, yes, there is a good thing or two about the Electoral College way of doing things. For instance, as stated in source three, "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both ahd a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes." 
One is that the region of mars called Cydonia is filled with natural landforms like this one but this one just looks like an Egyption Pharaoh. 
Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change 
however that is completely false. 
it is a big help on our state workers. 
I would love the chance to get to have my cell phone out. 
its the teachers job to design such things. 
Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair. There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done. 
Yes, you may be right in some way.Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.This COULD have been made by aliens.Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.That is the only argument that you have against me. 
we should do Electoral College 
For example if a student was to tutor a child from an elementary school and they did not want to they might tell the elementary student the wrong answers on purpose because they do not want to be there. 
and they can help kids find potential ideas and hobbies. 
In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, "...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors" 
Another downside to the distance learning system is that students would not have daily interaction or learn how to work with their peers. 
The students who don't like it say "it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do" 
think about i kid who like to play sports would only have to do the minimal amount of work to do what they love if u put it up to a B kids who play sports would have to try harder to do what they love that would improve test scores for the school and help a lot of things.and look at how many kid play sport u could make more sports so more kids would want to join the sports and then more kids would have to try to get better grades to do the sport they love it would also help no child left behind law by improving test scores so u can get better funding for your school and the funds could go to the sports so more people would want to play them so more people would have to get there grades up witch would improve more test scores so u could aford good things for the sch 
In conclusion if we could possibly bulid something to survive venus we could find some amazing things like if it ever ahad water and find maybe remains of past forms of life. 
I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements. 
Look at "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can "swing" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen. 
Also, gas and oil would no longer have anywhere near as much value as it does now. Without oil and gas prices, even more poeple would be without jobs. Not to mention taxes would be brought up on everything else to try and keep the economy stable, but in reality, the rise in taxes would make everyone but the government looking for loose change. Especially people who have more importants things to pay for, like children and disabili 
whether it be with the thoughts of their Buzz Lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone. When children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system, these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile, solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task. If a child were to attempt to learn at home, no matter what age they were, they would be surrounded with the temptations of play, and, even if they had the power to restrain, it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information. 
many researchers are working on innovations that will allow machines to last longer so they can get enough samples for them. 
Students would also have the ability to sit or adjust space for themselves once their lesson starts. From my own experience in school, I have heard many students complain about how uncomfortable the chairs are and how people keep kicking their seats and so forth. This can be a very big distraction for many students. The amount of discomfort they experience, while they are trying to focus can distract their learning and even cause them to have pains once they return home. 
As the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, I agree with him 
I think if the votes are close then everybody should vote again not just one person outta ten people the state has to choose. Also it is not done professionaly like it is supposed to be. Some people deserve a shot at it but no you guys think that the presidents from the last election should be put back in well no because that same guy who won it last year has the chance to win it again and its not fair if he wins it again. 
The Electoral College system has the votors vote but not for the president, but for the slate of electors, that then turns and elect the president off of there own votes.As a soon to be voter it will be better to let the voters make the desion on who our president should be. All Americans should have the choice of saying who going to be president over us for the 2 or 4 years. I dont feel Electoral College is needed in this case. votes need to be taking with the population of votes that are sumitted by us the voters. 
To keep the Electoral College, or to switch to election by popular vote for the President of the United States, 
it helps them maintain grades 
if teachers do include this option to student within the projects, it could give students the possibility of having fun and actually learning while they are strengthening skills they feel confident in. All teachers want is for their students to learn in an efficient manner in order to succeed, but that outcome won't be possible if teachers give out projects that don't include student decision making. If teachers want to achieve this outcome, they should give student different options to format their project in order for them to learn in the most efficient way so they can ultimately succeed academically and in the future. 
But a face from an allien, that sounds, and is unlogical. We have done so much reasarch towards this landform. Shadows give it the look of a face, and thats why we can only see it sometimes. In fact mission controllers even said you had to capture it at the correct lighting. But, if it were a real face, you could see it anytime. 
What I think about FACS is that we dont need it 
One reason is certainty of outcome, a president can have more citizen votes than the other, but the losing candidate can still win because of the electoral votes. Another reason this happens is because most states have a winner-take-all basis, meaning that the state chooses and the winning person with the most votes gets a state vote, even if you personally didn't vote for that person. Another reason why is because the U.S. has many larger states and the Electoral College balances it out for them. 
seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can listen to others' point of view, get help from trained professionals, and can be given the opportunity to have a successful future. People should take initiative to ask for help and shouldn't rely on only one person's opinion.  
Source 2 states, "Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." This method of choosing the president is completely and totally fair to the people. 
Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself. 
Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy . 
Initially the Electoral College voting method sounded like a great idea 
cause it helps people get into a college that they would like to get into or want to it can make them happy and then later on in life they can make better choices to live free and get god jobs and have anice apartyment and other things of that sort much it is for the. 
helps students discover their interest, 
The Facial Action Coding System would be a great thing to have in school because some kids are shy an dont like to talk and raise there hands in class infront of everyone and if you dont ask questions when you dont understand something that could cause you to fail the class all because of your shyness. 
help you focus on the conquences of others opinions, 
The Facial Action Coding system does so many great things that would help schools and society. It helps with schooling because it could make it more fun, they use video imagery which helps recognize the facial emotion, and humans perform this act every day but, the Facial System helps with expressing the emotion. These all help the world in so many ways. 
Students know students best, plus it could develop skills for future planning 
not driving has many advantages that help you and your city. 
Micheal malin went to take more pictures which was more clear and he found out that it is just a natural landorm. 
Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. 
The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day. 
I recall a time when i was seven i visited California. When i was there i saw a sign that said volunteer hours from 6-7 pm Monday threw Friday. I thought in my head wowo what a great opportunity. I took on the challenge and i was amazed at the outcome of what i did. Every thing in that area was as clean as a wisthe. I thought to myself wow look what community service can do. I also recall a time when i was ten years old i saw this animal walking down the street. I was amazed because i saw this big soda can on his head. I went to go take it off and i found out something else. The poor little bird was chocking on a piece of paper. I called animal serevice right away for help. They the bird and saved its life. I thought to myself, now if somebody would have threw it in the garbage this would of never happend. 
But even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something up. In spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate 
The kids from those families would probably get in trouble because their beliefs, and would have to do service even though they don't want to.This may cause disagreements with the school and the family.I think it would be a bit unfair. 
The governor has to prepare the Certificate of Ascertainment.What the Certificate of Ascertainment do is that it declares the winning presindential of the state and it doesn't just declares who is  the winning presidential it additionaly shows you will electors are going to represent your state atr the meeting of the electors  in December of the election Year. Finally your state's Certificates of Ascertainment they are sent to the Congress of your country and the National archives it as part of the official  records of the presidential election. 
For example,in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote and I am sure that the african americans and the women and even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. Of course if we had the popular vote system today,the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who are excluded wouldn't like the system at all. 
Have you ever wanted a yearbook? yearbooks have many memories, and excitment . You can be apart of this exciting journey. 
Technology today can take ten times better pictures then back in 1976. 
A grade C average is low for participating in sports. 
Without other students, the limit is set extremely low on the personal growth of the learner. When there is peer involvement, there is growth in the character and intelligence of the person. This kind of negative influence on students also adds to the very limited learning experience online. Most of the learning factors that make a well rounded student are not present. For example, the interaction between a teacher and a student will be blunt and simple instead of a face-to-face learning experience. Peer discussions are also limited because there might not be any time for an in depth discussion like there would be in a regular classroom. Peer involvement builds relationships that influence learning in a healthy environment. These normal student acts will be limited if the classes are based in online servers instead of the classroom. 
However, Students have time to study. When he study at home, the place is quit that can he focus in studying, then he will be smart and good thinker. When you do by yourself you will have much confidence. Being confidence by yourself. Being Good thinker. Being work harder. Being developing skill of studying and developing knowledge. 
Asking multiple people for their opinions will also make you sure that you choice will be the right one. 
Many citizens in the United States vote for whom they believe will acheive the goals and standards of serving as the U.S President. People think the process of voting is simple, but is it really? In the U.S, there is the Electoral College, which is'nt such a good thing for some people. 
Our community probably doesn't look as mush as perfect as you see it. There's a lot of people out there that throw trash around or don't cut the grass from abandoned buildings. 
I am arguing that it is valuable. 
Once the citizens, have the knowledge of these unprudent organizations, voting is going to be outlooked as an petition, that isn't necessary of taking toll of. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing'' states. The pending thought, that ones' state might be chosen out of the many, is certainly doubtful. The Electoral College, can upbring wins in the popular votes but lost in the presidency, these democracies need to be abolished because it should be a doubt that the President and the opposed public, should be uncondemed of. Clearly, the definition of this service is dooming and should be reinforced from the Constitution, to prevent the countrys' votes from going unknown. 
it can make driving boring

But the moral of the story is that no i would never but this comuputer its a good brand to the school and all but i would just not get one.- but we all know i would never get one of these computers-This is what i think of the Facial Action Coding System Computer 
If the enforcer of this project wrote a rigid outline describing exactly what a learner must write about, the report could very plausibly be submitted as a mindless paper with no true interest taken in it. The individual could provide exactly what the teacher asks for, no more, no less. One may even be rewarded for this work since they did all that was asked of them. 
it is time we change this and let the people vote 
Venus can be another earth and maybe that way people can find many resources in venus. 
it prevents pollution and smog. 
It might be dangerous but one day we will get to go to venus. NASA is trying there hardest to get a person to venus but we need more materials and money for that. Almost 3 decades we haven't went to venus. It's a challenge to study and get back. NASA will complete this challenge. 
Technology can make people mad in happy its just how you use it in how you do it like you can look up things that you know that will make you happy. But in this story its saying that the computers know when you happy or sad or even confused but then it can help the person because it say it can modify.

The story is saying they want to know how people are feeling even when they are trying to hide it i think that is personal and the person will tell you if the person wanted you to know. 
No because, why should a computer know how your feeling? 
trying to examine Venus more closely then of the safe vantage point of Earth, can be very challenging despite it being simple to see from the distance. 
helps them get organized 
NASA looked into this "face" a lot more. Me and my crew where up all night for days just digging deeper for more information! Finally, after days of reserch I got some feed back. I unveild the images of this thing for all to see 
People got the wrong idea about the face 
Even people think that Venus is probably our nearest option for a planetary visit just like in the article it says," The National Aeronautics (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus" 
They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting "the okay" from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice. 
The author supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents realy good

Sports! Clubs! we have these thing too you know. and after our 8 hours of school add this on and it almost makes it 12 hours. plus our homework, do you really think that we would have enough tine to waltz out into the wilderness and pick up trash every day for another 2?!!?! 
When there is a decision to be made, it is always important to ask more than one individual for advice 
Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. There is a new law called "hands free" where people that own a cell phone cannot operate it while driving. This has effected people that own motor vehicles in many ways. 
Is getting emotional facial recognization the best way to go with technology? Computers are getting smarter and it doesn't sound like it will be slowing down any time soon. When scientests and computer programers combine it can be a beautiful thing. Scientests are developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate. With new encoding and development of software scientests have now created a way for a computer to tell how someone is feeling by using their facial muscles. 
However allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to challege themselfes . They will also probley pick a project that is enjoybal to them and will make the learning experiance so much better and the students will most likely complte a project they ejoy doing. Also allowing students to design their own project wont make them be careless it will allow them to make adult choices on their own . This being said will show how much they are growing up and how they can make good choices on their own and how they can do it by themselfs . Allowing them to pick it will mostlikly make them make better choices much rather then carless ones . 
Also it is unfair to the people who want to be presidents because they mostly have a tie on the electoral votes and are elected on who wins the popular vote. 
what would happen without phones in the world, 
because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. because thats the only way to get somewhere. 
However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people 
The described form of distance learning can be advantageous for those who are unable to attend school in person due to unforeseen issues, such as a medical diagnosis. 
To Avoid Run-Off Elections The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in witch no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast 
It would be amazing because as a scientist you should always check for yourself. If you did a previous report on that planet or subject I think you should bring your old evidence and documents out to make things come together to understand better. 
Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one 
Like see if they need help or if they aren't feeling good. Mostly things like that. You could also use it to see if kids are lying or not when they get in trouble and have to go to the principle or when they get in trouble at home. 
The reason I like to play sports is to be able to tell my son one day that I played sports when I was in school so he would like to play sports when he gets in the 6 -12 grade. 
For example, my friend Generic_Name turned in her english essay four days late. Her teacher realized when the assigment was handed in late that she needed to work on her time management skills. Therefore, she guided Generic_Name with her next essay by explaining how it would be easier to start planning earlier in order to turn in her essay on time. Now, Generic_Name makes it a priority to turn in all of her assignments in on time. Another example of teachers giving students good advise is when Oprah Winfrey was doing very well in school. Her teachers saw that she had exceptional work habits and urged her to get a higher level of education. Now, she has become a famous philanthropist that helps many people in the world through her talk shows and interviews. Teachers advise encourages students to work harder and continue to progress in everything that they do.

However, many people are wondering whether self-driving cars are a help or a danger to society. 
Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc.

I understand that these cars would give you a form of entertainment to keep you occupied while in the vehicle, 
For example in the tex it states that " formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.

getting multiple opinions can help you feel more confident in what you are choosing. 
In technology, the human muscles, 3-D computer model of the face and all major humans muscles are installed in the computer, "The process begins when the computer constructa 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit". Technology should not be use to paint or even draw because technology cannot express human feelings and behavior.

Reasons will include things like, "it's an excuse for students to continue bad habits and remain irresponsible", "it was good enough for us back then", or "they should be able to do it like everyone else", etc. Some may hold such opinions because it's simply an unconventional way of learning, or allows students the freedom to do things their own way 
Thousands of car related accidents happen every minute around the world in automobiles. If everyone started walking, biking, or using pubilc transportation less cars would be on the road leading to less accidents.

The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this "face" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face 
Families should have their homes with their cars under their garage. Car ownerships is allowed, but there are only two places to park. When i had a car i was always tense. But passenger cars they are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. Its basic precepts are being adapted around the world in attempts to make surburbs more accessible to public transportation. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs , where middle-class families from chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. 
For example Barack Obama he is helping immagrants go back to school be able to get a job and be something in life, like maybe a mechanic,doctor, or even a federal officer. They chances that he has gave us lets people know that these are the type of presidents we need.

I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. 
I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. 
Also the electors rarely betrayed the voting. Then the are times where the candidate wins the elctoral vote, then loses the national popular vote. 
The school council is a great program. They all you the make statments for the schools. This is one of many choices to be a leader. School council is a great extracurricluar program for students it makes staments,and is a good choice to be a leader.

It compromises the election of the President by a vote in Congress ang election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

Not saying its true but if NASA had shown an alien on Mars the world would freak out and we wold destroy each other.Now tell me if you seen an alien on Mars what would you do? 
Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election 
With all these benefits to distance learning, it is clear as to why schools should offer this style of learning. There are many students that would benefit from this kind of learning and their grades as well as confidence would improve greatly. While not all students would benefit from distance learning, there is a clear need for this type of learning for a certain percentage of kids, and is crucial that schools offer this kind of learning option. 
If you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once).

I belive that these cars will wreck and not work as well as well as they think and its a waste of time and money. In the far future when they have tested them alot more and know they are safe for people to drive in, then I belive it is more appropriate. 
you cant force anyone, 
Many people claim having a phone while driving isn't dangerous. Nowadays accidents happen due to cell phones. We live in an age when many of us are excited by a call or text that we can't wait to answer. Texting while driving is a hotly debated topic that often divides opinion. It goes without saying that driving with a mobile phone is one of the most important issues facing us today. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument.

At all basic levels the Electoral collage is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each states, candidates dont spend time in each state they know they have no changes of winning or losing , so they focus only on the tight races. 
responsibility 
The Electoral College, can sometimes give voters no hope to the candidate they want to win because electors could vote for the other candidate. An example is, Republicans in a state might eventually know that their vote will have no effect so they end up paying less attention the the competing presidential candidates. I think that thats a reason how plurality happens and voters think its unfair.    
its a good strategy to make your work more diverse

In conclusion technology that scans your face to read your emotions has too many ethical questions, financial problems, and no personal connections for this computer process to be acceptable in the classroom. Although this advancement is impressive, the classroom setting is most definitely not the right place for this type of computer process.

Ladies and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins.   
People want to base their choice on the others opinions instead of just go with the flow.

And venus it the hottest plant even though mercury closer to the sun 
I think that community service should be required from all students because, without help from the people of the community it will not be nice enough to enjoy. 
"Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a veicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditition by staying up and ount of their way" That it is imported to study Venus even if it dangers. 
Google's own self driving cars have been able to driver over half a million miles without a crash. (Paragraph 2) Here we can see that the technology is there, it just has not been able to be implemented and the law has not caught up to where self driving cars are

A study conducted by the Time Management Association showed that 87% of all students that are in extracurricular activities have started to use a calendar or agenda to plan their time. Using your time wisely can be very beneficial when you have many things to get done. It can also help with not procrastinating. By knowing what has to be done and when it has to be done, you are more likely to actually do that work. This will help you prepare for what will come in the future. Your whole life will need to be planned out: when to get groceries, what needs to be done at work, when to go to the dentist, or even when to pick up a child from school. Whatever the scenario is, it is crucial to manage your time wisely. Life can get chaotic and it is important to know how to handle the chaos. 
People who vote for a president that gets the most popular votes, and they dont win the election, can start big disputes among the way the elections are carried out. 
In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the 'thoughtful' voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves. 
for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were "faithless" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america. 
The main reason students say that they cannot participate in community services is because they play sports, or are on the dance team, or in English festival. They participate in something extracurricular, therefore they don't have the time between games and practices to balance out there schedule and their grades.

People shouldn't think that doing community service wastes your time 
The amount of work the teacher would have would decrease rapidly for them. Make them have more time to plan for the next class or have more time for them self.

Driverless cars are getting attention, but as soon as the public knows they will only be for wealthy hands for a bit of time, the excitment will die down. 
Distance learning can occur through various means and technologies, but the main purpose is the same across the board. The central focus of distance learning is to allow students to learn even when they cannot be physically present at school. Distance learning has been used before for both long and short periods of time including snow storms, illness, or a mental issue. 
You also get to explore new places around the world with me and my friend 
No one has ever landed on venus so the author is saying this because no space ship has survived landing for more than a few hours. maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on veunus more than three decade, 
The way to get home because home school your in home so that is and in schools there bus that is it. So yes I feel like students have to learing sameing new says if a person is thing of be comeing home shools because I thing that is a little more freedome that they can have online school can be different in a way if it is the first time but it is haveing a good time. And all the problems in school you that in home that may not happing so that is one of the thing at can stop. if someone has online class say if work is not due a week you can have a long brak. In school you can not do that a long brak. 
Driverless cars may indeed help those who are in need of going from one place to another such as senior citizens, legally blind, etc.

I wouldnt want to be stalked on when i'm driving or anything. it violates someones privacy when youre watching them because some people od have to do certain things when they are parked for example like having to use an emergency or changing clothes. "While the driver watches the road , the car watches the driver" Do you really think that drivers are going to watch the road when they dont have to? I also believe that peopel will start sueing companies because who is at fault if theres an injury or accident?"if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is al fault- the driver or the manufacturer? I think that people who are being responsible and driving with great cautions will be upset and it would not be fair to them if they are under control of their own car and than there is someone els thats not drving but lettign their car being controled by a computer than they get in an accidents. I do knwo that there are accidents from many reasons, but I believe that driverless cars can cause a lot of problems. 
The cell phone has become so much of a distraction to the point where people are immune to picking up their phone every time they receive a notification. 
Is there really a new kind of life on mars. No! We are the only life in this universe. Plus if people lived on mars, how could they build such a huge amount of rock into a face so perfectly.

My guess would be natural landform. 
Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery. 
Your phone could get stolen.You could get it confiscated.If phones get stolen there will be accusations and there will be some students who would fight because of those accusations.There could be more fights and stolen properties and parents would get upset and they could press charges to the school or the person who stole the phone.

Second reason I agree is that time is priceless it is not infinite people dont know how much time they really have therefor its better to make the best of it before its all gone therefor the people who have chosen to use there time. Wisely they have much more time cause they have done what they had to do getting more time but it docent mean the people around them will get the same cause they chose there path and they chose there toured success. By choosing that path they have chosen there future which docent really change unless there has been a large impact like death or courage to do what ever it takes to succeed no mater what any body says to try to turn you down.

This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes. 
but, in the eyes of others, it may seem "Unfair, outdated and irrational." Says Bradford Plumer. 
i think that we should use this technology at school to read the students emotions. 
Students use phone they will looking for YouTube,and they learn some think there video. when students doing online classes attend if they didn't know that they will be taping the Google and students get some information. 
Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. 
we should keep awere electrol college 
Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport. 
On the year of 2000, the campaign of seventeen states didn't get to see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Not even the largest media markets got to see a single campaign ad. But in ohio they probably have a chance on having a good argument for putting the presidency in the hands of a small amount of voters. These are some reasons why some people might want to change the electoral college because it's unfair to some states and people. 
I think people should and shouldn't use their phones while driving. 
I disagree what is the principal is saying because they cant forcing any the student, the students should decided they own, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity. The students should be able to choose what they ever want.      
lack social skills 
It should be changed to electing presidents by popular vote. It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different 
because students may need to contact a parent or guardian, 
There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College;1) Certainly of Outcome- A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible 
As long as their phones are in silence or they won't be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice 
While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote. 
Obviously the system has its flaws 
In some cases the student's prefer to come at the school, but I believe that for mejority of us, is preferable to take classes in online, because we don't have troubles with anyone and we can do the classes in anytime. 
Have you ever wondered what it is like in Venus and how we might be able to study more about it. 
But thats not just the only advantage, theres more! another advantage is that it can make you relax as well because then you would be able to spend more "family" time and some "you" time because you wont have to worry about  going to places if you cant use your car 
I decided I am going to go. You should go too. 
Teachers can organize a summer project better than students because they are highly experienced in doing so. Teachers find ways to engage and challenge their students which leads to a higher passing rate. So while student-designed projects can be fun and easy, it's more effective when summer projects are teacher-designed. The biggest problem with teacher-designed projects is that not every teacher or student is the same, However teacher-designed projects are said to be more successful than student-designed projects. They are not always fun, but they are always effective. Teachers are always working to help students gain information and be successful in life. So next time you have a summer project and you want it to be student-designed, think about all the things your teachers do to make sure you are going to be successful. It isn't supposed to be easy, and it isn't always going to be fun, but as long as you learn the information, it will always be beneficial. 
In United states, they don't need for help. they know how to do something, they know to make something nice and strong before they can help other community. They just help other community. who is the poor family, They give food, they give rice, and they give all of stuff they have. They love to help other community 
There are 3 important sources that tell us why people should limit car usage . Source 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars. Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog . Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Last but not least ,Source 4 : The end of car culture . 
Another reason is that some kids learn better with others. 
By being helpful you can get an award for future use or you can be very proud of yourself and let other people around you be proud of you too 
promote alternative transportation, 
you get to hear which piece of advice is most saidSupporting detail number 2: you get to choose from all the opinionsRestate thesis: There are multiple opinions from hearing multiple peoples advice because you get to to hear which piece of advice is most said and you get to choose from all the opinions. 
Limiting car usage doesn't mean that people will have to stop buying cars; it simply means that they will have to find a different method of transporation. Source 2 says that in Paris on certain days motorist, who had an odd or even license plate number, had to leave their cars at home and find an alternative method of transportation. Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn't ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars; this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today's society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas. In Paris, they made exceptions "for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers (Source 2)". These exceptions actually promote the buying of hybrid cars! This will boost the economic profit of the car companies, not damage it. 
Some people think that the face on Mars is really created by aliens. There is some scientifical evidence to this. 
First and foremost I believe that we live in a community that is well kept and organized, and it should remain that way. The generations before us have given us a place filled with love and care , a place of neat parks and recreation centers, a place we can call home. 
It was twenty five years ago. Thar Mars was discovered by a spacecraft it was going around Mars and found a shadow that looked like a human face and it was getting enormous. The head you could found was from two miles from end to end. The face on Mars is found in 41 degress north martian latitude and also it was winter.A few days later there was a change that mars is becoming a pop icon 
the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result. 
secendly, theres ba computer that contructs a three-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move around like the human muscles. there are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness the three-D computer can detect all six of these emotions and calculate the emotions and tell you how you really feel. 
by emphasizing crucial topics 
In conclusion Mr. Senator the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational because it is unfair to voters, there could be a tie in the electoral vote and the voters are merely voting for a slate of electors and not there president. 
Students can take notes on paper but, they can lose their notes easily. You can also send your notes to yourself if they ever get deleted. Students prefer online notes than paper notes because they are easier to find online. Students taking online classes will think it was a good idea choosing online classes. 
"You can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait." 
Now I hoped I gave you enough information to convince you that the Face is just a natural landform, and not created by aliens.   
Like in Vauban Germany they have gave up on there cars so they have baned cars, and that most of the population has got rid of their car, and or sold them to stay in Vauban which has a population of 5,500 residents. The people now in Vuaban walk of side walks, and are more actice most of the citizens like it that way. which that is a good way to get over car is to use bikes, skateboards, and ect. So that people can be more active, and social. It is also good that they do that so they can get a exercise than just sitting in a car, and driving to a location. 
Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. 
They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from the road. Although hands-free devices do not increase safety, but causes the same amount of distraction as if one were holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from paying attention to the road. Studies show that the reaction time significantly reduces when paying attention to a phone rather than the road for an aged person. Now imagine how much more this affects an elderly person. 
it will give them a harder drive to make good grades and do good in school 
The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the "swing" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state. 
This does make sure the students do not text or call during class. They need to be learning and paying attention so they will be smart and go to college and have a great successful life. This will be good for the children to be able to be in contact with individuals out side of the school area and yet still be learning and getting a higher education. Therefore, policy two will be more efficient to the children and to this school. 
Seeking multiple people for opinions on a matter allow one to make a better choice. 
It sounds interesting to me 
'It is the most adventrous, exciting job you can possibly get, 
People ask other people for advice because they can get different perspectives, see the other side of something, and have the most information they could get. Everyone needs advice at some point in time and with the information they get from others, they can make the best decisions possible. 
Requiring students to do community service also goes against human rights, nobody is able to make them do community service. 
In paragraph fourteen it states, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Benijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. 
Cars in our society has been a benefical invention that we've had. Now that we are living in the 21st century people are worried about the negative effects that cars are contributting to. 
"so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global surveyour flew over Cydonia for the first time,Michael Malin and his (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the orginal". Once we recived the photo from Michael and his team we dug in to see what this really was. 
I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a ceratin candiate running for president. 
This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. 
Students can just go to the main office and use the school's phones if they have to call someone. 
i believe that the people who are trying to go to venus or sent something to venus should do it because you never know what other kids of things are out there and if we dont try news things we wont discover new stuff . 
It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes. 
The world today revoles mainly around science, and scientists will do what they have to do to get information. "Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landinf for more than a few hours" (paragraph 2). 
in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then Bush. But the agurement falls apart since it happens rarely. It was the frist time since 1888 that's about 112 years that this has happened. It's even highly unlikely it will end in a tie-as 538 is an even number it is divied to the states. 
This means that that people would argue over the electoral college vote and who they voted for but but people most likely would not argue over the popular vote. They have done this before in 2012's election prosses with Obama and Romney. 
If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.  Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us. 
If you are planing for college the guidance will help you by getting scholarship from college or sports team.Also, for students who like to play sports will have the chance to play sports with school team, and will help them by getting a scholarship. 
When someone is in custmer service they could be able to tell if the person is looking for someone quick or if they are taking there time sad or mad. They be able to take the knowledge that they have aquired and turn it into some thing that the person has never seen. They be able to turn a frown upside down. 
One advantage to not driving is that it reduces a lot of stress. And it also helps clear all the traffic off the streets. 
Overall, both ideas are great and really help them learn the material well, I just believe that the student would be better off by having the teacher design the assignment. The teachers know exactly the material the student needs to know to be successful in the course. The teacher have spent years familiarizing themselves with the information invoved in the course. The teachers should be designing the assignments because what is best for the student and the material the student must know before coming to the class. 
To continue, some presidential candidates intentions to society are harmful and do not help them in anyway possible. Presidents intentions while on their four years of being presidents are supposed to help society and make their life easier and not worse. In the article "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer he states "can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Somtimes." this quote shows that 
Another reason is because students do it without permission anyway. 
Sometimes something happens like sometime their computer act up or they need to be replaced so sometimes they are not reciving information from the robots and it makes it very diffcault to see what is happing in Space, and what is happing on the Plants. So sometimes the astronuts would have to go into space and retreve the robots themselfs and bring them back to earth so they can fix them if the robot is broken 
Who pick the first electors in the first place? I know the answer to that it depends on the state. Its sometimes the states conventions, the states party central committee, and the presidental candidates themselves. 
First, driverless cars can drive at ease when other driverless cars are in uniform with the other cars, but when one car has someone drivng the car then the driverless cars aren't able to predict the outcome the real driver will make. 
Join the Seagoing Cowboys program so you can help people in need!We think that you would be perfect for the program! Here are some reasons why you should join! 
I deeply support the fact that community service does the world a lot of good. 
Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets 
First off, I suggest that some states stop using the "winner-takes-all" system. 
everyday pelple want to know whats going on in their government and you erase the fact and make them think the electoral college is the answer. you have to go back to making popluar vote a thing, 
People can listen to others' point of view, which may make it easier for them to decide what decision they're going to make. For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. 
The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, 
Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online . 
The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting. 
To begin with under the 23rd amendment of the constitution ,"The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college" and for that saying , in the  following discussion , the  word state also refers to the district of columbia. Also Each and every candidate that is running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."Foremost , under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the persident , but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president."Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the  first place? it depends on the state. Now i understand sometimes at state conventions , Partys , central committee , sometimes the presidental candidates themselves , Also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate."The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the electoral college is what we might call the  disaster factor. Its Basically whenever theres a  really good argument thats what its called.Subconstantquintly , Sometimes most people worry about the prospect of a tie in the elections vote. "In That case , the election would be thrown to the house of representatives , where state delegations vote on the president." At the most basic level , the electoral college is unfair to voters. "because of the winner-take-all system in each state , candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. Then now its official " The electoral college is unfair , outdated , and irrational." The best arguments in favor of it in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. 
Even though venus is the close to earth twin there are still many dangers to exploring the planet. 
In this day and age, mobile phones have become very addictive and hard to put down. 
Both of those ideas, however, are false. Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice. Through video chatting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers, everyone needs social interaction and distance learning takes that into account. Many students find it easier to learn while sitting at a desk or table, both of which are very common in any household, therefore, students lazing around in bed while learning is highly unrealistic. 
Why i think changing the election to the president with the most votes will help because its gives the president more opportunity or chance to have a fair election. 
i believe that we should keep the electoral college 
Why should everyone be putting they're trust with votes into people they dont know? Even when I read the passage I saw that the electors could possibly get confused and vote the wrong way and if many of them end up doing that you can ultimately end up with the wrong president. 
I know that when I play a sport and I love I can't stop thinking about it and eventually my grades will just drop ,it is like I am a Leaf in the fall. Also, It isn't very pleasant going home and showing my parents my report cards if I failed any class. My grades started going up as soon as I had quit softball, trust me it makes a big difference in the grades. 
Some people might not want there feelings to be read because its a matter or privacy 
Although virtual learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students, the consequences of implementing online classes outweigh the benefits. 
though it isn't good either. 
This program is where people like me help rcover other countries with their food supplies, animals, and more. 44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). 
If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive. 
at least thtats my opinion but really something like that just seems like a huge waste of money we dont come to school to talk about our emotionsn we come to school because we need to learn and make new friendsand thats why i think a device that can read emotions is a huge wasste of money. plus it sounds pretty worthless if you ask me if you wanna know if someone is sad or not just ask us and we should answer its that simple theres no need to build something that complicated when you can just ask them youself theres really no need for something thats that complicated also what about mona lesa smileing thay said they needed that to discover if were smiling good to i think we can tell if someone is smiling and if someones isnt so yeah 
Online classes would allow sick students to remain attending classes and not fall behind while remaining comfortable in their homes or hospitals. 
because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it. 
When we ask questions like "Can we actually 'calculate' emotions like we calculate math problems? or "How can a simple computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans have to use and show how we feel? shows that we humans need this type of cool technology in the future to make things easier than what they are nowadays! 
If everyone just did one community service this world would be a step closer to being a lot better. Each year goes by and the world gets worse for the animals in nature and for us 
I'm here to talk to you about keeping the electoral college 
As you can see, there is no reason to change it so that the president gets his votes by poularity. 
They might not have it because they arent at home or on vacation because its summer time or maybe just might not be able to afford the supplies needed for the project. If the student can designe their project for them selfs they will most likly pick a project they can afford the supplies for or can get . Also saying the fact its summer time you could pick a project to challge yourself because you might be in a diffrent place . Some projects the students could designe could be no money for them at alll and still a good learning experience that was fun for them and not having to pay any money could help out the students who cant afford a project a teacher may have designed . 
In the booming world today, transportaion is essential. Trying to imagine life without cars for some people is like trying to imagine life without food or water, but cars arent ass essential as we think.  
Community service should be a choice, not mandatory. Sometimes students serve the community with the little things they do every day, like RELATIVE_NAME's challenge says. Clubs and organisations are important to a student too and with community service around there would be no time. Some students might not even do the service at all. And it takes too long which may result in sleep loss. I hope you take my views into consideration. 
Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." 
School shouldnt offer this because people wont make any friends. 
They only took pictures of the face.No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it? 
Also it's better to have a nice environment. 
In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president on that outcome.) 
In Bogota, Colombia millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day. Which left the Colombian streets devoid of traffic jams. 
Whats wrong with it 
The first thing to remember, is that the Electoral College is unfair and needs to be changed to the popular vote because the people should be able to vote who they want to be president. 
Some people might not like the Electoral College just becaues they might think that its not fair. 
but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. 
Me myself agreed with this decision 
due to the fact that voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors 
To begin, keeping the Electoral College makes citizens feel that they are in the system. Even though they may not feel like they are in the system, this will let people's voices be heard and give them their rights to vote for who they want as President 
Parents as we all know are very strict about chores, and when a kid doesn't accomplish them, parents can get really mad. 
Based on the text evidence," Making Mona Liza Smile,"a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.Based on this article, " the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)." This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, " most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc." 
with the project being student designed it would be a lot of different ideas students can choose from 
It could be better because the answer that the person is giving could be the answer they're looking for. 
An evidence that it says that the author is supporting this idea is in paragraph five. In paragraph it says that " Solor power would be plentiful, and raidiation would not exceed Earth level. Not easy condition, but survivable for humans." 
the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. 
The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? 
The phones can be used for multiple reasons during school, distractions, and getting answers to test, quizzes, and possibly MCAS testing. 
This however is not the case. Many students in the classroom, have stated that they wish that they could do more at home, so that if they miss school, they aren't rushing to get back on top 
How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged. 
I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America 
Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. 
i think that we should cape the electoral college process 
In the real world, employers are not going to wait around for whenever their employee wakes up, they are going to set a time when the employee should be at work and expect them to be there. Employers aren't usually looking for candidates that show up late to interviews or employees who show up late to work every day. Not being punctual can not only hurt people in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives. Friends, family members, and significant others are going to want to invite their loved one to breakfasts, lunches, parties, and more and are going to be upset and angry when they show up late or not at all, which could end up with that person losing a lot of people whom they care about 
For example some of the other students parents may not allow their kids to do community service because they probably have chores at home. 
The third and final thing that is wrong with the electoral college is that the electoral college is unfair to the voters 
All we have to do is vote and who ever gets the most votes win. I think its just a fair method to use. I feel like the other method is just to complex so we should stick to the college voting method. almost half of the time to president we choose is the right president for the US. 
In 2000 people might have switched their votes because they thought that person desirved it not the other guy. The system of "winner takes all" hasn't failed since 2000. 
I believe that this system is unfair and should be abolished. 
The author explain"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 4). It proves that the video imagery can be a interesting thing because the software can tract facial movement if it's real or not. 
Also, the Electoral colllege requires a presidential candidate to have trans regiona, all arounf he country, appeal 
If it was human, in a couple of months or years (maybe), your body becomes rotton and turn into nun but bones. If it was human, then it would have body parts along side with it. There's no body parts near it except rocks and holes. Besides, the picture look like it was taking from a pretty far distance for the head is bigger then that boulder next to it. 
Electoral Colleges are very important and should be in every "state" 
look at the facts and you will see why i want the it to stay moving and not to be kicked out.    
but they have others choses like school in the night or after school. 
like how it would be around 170 fahenheit there. The air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. These details he gives us about the conditions Venus has are far to exterme, but the author says it survivable for humans. 
The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well. 
The motivation and speech that the scouter is presented with will question the reasoning for future actions that they would have tried to complete.Additionally, only by pointing out the reasons certain things are better than another will anyone see why they truly are. Discussing specific matters with those who are around will open the door to the realization of the successes that have been a result before. These positives outweigh the negatives and compel people to utilize their processes.Not to mention the experience that has created the viewpoints of others. From their own hardships and struggles, mentors will know what is a credible thing to go by. Being taught about the things these people went through will assure the listener that there are more rational things to do. Using the past decisions of elders as a format for one's own will offer assistance in the improvement of an open mind's supposed best way to solve a problem. 
There should not be any elementary kids picking up litter on the side of the road 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by online schooling 
These students, especially if they are video conferencing, have the opportunity to learn one-on-one with a teacher who can address their individual needs. 
Alot of colleges accept students who got their diploma online 
You can tour the world while helping other countries! 
It could tell us about how Venus works and how it was created. 
First, community service should forced because it make our area a better place to live overall. 
because it gives the people a say in who runs our country 
these are the reason why we should go to people vote for the president of the USA. 
Lastly, it is a way to chat with friends at other schools who are also at lunch. In this time period, cell phones are a major way to keep in contact with those who do not live in the same state or town as you. 
For example, when a president or government is being elected we can figure out who is grtting more electives. We can see how many people are voting and how many electives did each person received. With that being said we can easily tell which person won the elective and who didn't. We can also see the percentage of votes and how many states voted for each person. 
First of all I think it removes our voting right as an American citizen 
and how we know its a natural landform is because the article states, " It's just a huge rock fromation, Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth". It's not an alien monument It's just a natural landform on mar's. 
A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouses. 
Having no cell phones would mean that people would be focused more on their school work and all that jazz, rather than on their texts, and things like gossip, rumors, etc. 
Overall you should not take the Elctoral College away. Without The Electoral College there would not be a fair shot for the canidate to win. You should keep the Electoral vote!!! 
The face is not a actual face and it is just a natural landform. 
Some say that sports cause kids to not focus on school as much and that by forcing them to have higher grades before they can join you get immediate results, 
While one solution may not work very well, another may be the best one for you. Asking more people also increases the chances of finding someone who had to make the same decision or was in the same situation. This would be incredibly helpful because they could give advice on what they chose to do and the result. For example, when I was working on a difficult math problem, I asked many people for their ideas on how to approach it. Though some of them could not solve the problem or help me, others came up with brilliant solutions. One of them had seen a similar problem before, so he pointed me in the right direction. By asking more than one person for advice, I received many choices from which I could pick the best one. 
There are of course dangers that come along with the tough job of helping our community, an example would be, predators prowling the area 
They discover these faces on a red planet that is know as "Mars". There could be more aliens on that planet but we don't know. 
According to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. 
The consumer has to realize that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, the consumer has to know that they have to remain attentive while being in the driver's seat. "They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." (Driverless Cares Are Coming paragraph 7). Without the realization that they have to be attentive, some bad accidents could occur. 
showing how the class will operate. 
I think that diverless cars shouldn't be allowed on public roads because they are not safe. 
People that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.You hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.But, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.The people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.For example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.The student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.Then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.Finally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group. 
I think they it just happend from natural landform. 
and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them. 
The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism,   
what's the point? everything is fine just the way it i. why change it? 
But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. 
Many people may say that there is no better place than home, 
When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia 
Therefore if the voting was by popular vote instead of by the Electoral College literally anybody could become President if there isn't anybody looking at it that knows what they are doing. 
It could make people happier. 
A big reason that a student should not take at-home courses is because they won't be properly socialized. 
If you are in a sport, you say to yourself "hey if I keep my grade to a B average, then i can stay in my sport. " That to me is what helps most kids or teens that are in a sport . I could also see why my principal would change the grade is, because he/she has more students trying out for sports and also that he needs a good grading report from all of his students and half of his students are in a sport so that is why. 
Phones are a major distraction at school and is one of the main reasons students get in trouble some teachers are ok if the phone is in a purse or hidden and actually goes off others not so much. 
But i think you should like get the kids who are foot-ball players and form a foot-ball team at our school. 
This has to be just a natural landform that formed when a massive sandstorm hit 
allows for a more unbiased response, 
In order for you to reduce stress in your life, you have to take away the source of stress, and that is what citizens have done, and without cars majority of people are happier and healthier. 
If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, "Person two, who are you voting for?" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works. 
If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life. 
I think they would get in more wrecks and malfunction. 
another adavantage would be less deaths due to car accidents. 
Your friends will tell you many different things. That means you'll see things in many different point of views. Some of your friends know what you're going through so they have a better understanding of it. You'll understand it the same way they understand it because they told you what they know from it. Having many opinions from your friends will help you understand it more. 
so i this system have benfitie and bay way just lets we hao to use it 
Some people still say that the Electoral College is a good thing because they think it is a fair way of voting for President, but even if their vote doesn't really matter they still think it is a good thing to have for our country. 
When the author talks about Venus he talks about how it is and what it is like and how it works. 
When it comes to the law, texting and drinking while driving is illegal. If driverless cars were created and used, humans would be breaking two laws that harm drivers the most. Yes, the driver will be notified when they are in need by lights and a vibrating seat, but if they are under the influence they will not be able to anyways. If they are distracted in any way by texting, food, etc. then they will not be in a ready situation to take control of the vehicle. AS a driver, it would be nice to sleep and the driverless car would allow that, but that would be just as dangerous as sleeping behind the wheel in a regular car. The driver would not be ready to take the wheel or they would not even notice when they are in need to take the wheel. 
Also the teacher could see if the student is learning,listening, or even liking what the subject is 
I only had to stop working for a couple days,and then I was better than ever. When joining in this month you get you dont have to pay for a class abought the safeteys of being on a boat. You will be more exuberant than Christmas morning. My freind Don Reist got me into this program,so I hope I can get you to join this program like he did to me. 
In paragraph 7, the text clearly states, " There was no alien monument after all."This means that aliens could not have created the Face as a signification or monument to proof thier existance. 
A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. 
I think I will join the rest of the elementary schools and tell them the three r rules, which are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. I can't believe people don't just use this rule. Some people throw there trash on the streets then we have to pick it up. I think its not fair for the rest of us that we have to pick up other peoples trash. Sometimes i think some people are disgusting at the way we treat this world. We should treat it like its our nice house. I also think that people could use the three R' s. 
If there were to be a mix of car types on the road, there would be the issue of accidents caused by cars with drivers. 
Generic_City's lifeguard program was very successful during the summer due to lifeguard availability. Being a lifeguard is a common job students pursue during the summer. Not only does it allow students to gain profit at a young age, but it also requires a high level of maturity and responsibility. Because it requires specific training and dedication, students must have the time to complete every task that is given. Having a student-designed summer project allows students to set their own study time instead of following a specific schedule that could intervene with working hours.In 2019, the Pied-Piper Theater Association successfully rehearsed their summer musical: West Side Story The Musical, due to the availability and hard work of all actors. In West Side Story, the combination of performing arts and music are combined as one to produce an extraordinary musical. Rehearsing a musical is no simple task: lines must be memorized, choreography and blocking must be pristine, and every actor must be present on opening show days. A student-designed project over the summer can help students complete their required work in an flexible manner while still completing personal activities. 
Some days i think we all need to sothing besides going home and doing noting. 
The use of this technology is to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable to me 
The Electoral Collage does not has a democratic method of selectiong a president, and if there is a tie in electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president and the Senate would choose the vide-president. 
This policy also rewards some students who work hard in school, and deserve the usage of their phone. 
There are times where you feel like giving up and it seems easier to do so, but if you keep trying your best, you'll make it. 
Long ago like hundreds or even millions of years ago venus have beeen the most earth like planet in our solar system. Venus have many and multiple things that are similar to earth for instance venus have rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters 
Last, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electors rather than the president. 
students can cheat. 
Cell phones are going to take learning away from students if they have there phones with them all the time. 
help out people that is in need 
because then there will be happy and healthy students. 
They would have to make that machine with mechanical parts so that it can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. In paragraph 8, it states " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
like the one we have today. 
the reason why this happens is because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. 
I think at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. 
For instance,you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,etc". What all that means is when someone is having a bad day and you wanna help them but they say they are fine but you know that she/he is not ok but how can you tell? With the technology that we have we can be able to tell all of that. 
A new movemnent is trending everywhere, it's called "smart planning". It's simple, separate subarban life from auto use. 
One of the reasons that this is a good idea to me is because it will probably encourage kids to work harder on getting good grades in school so they can play the sport that they are interested in. 
The whole school year is an on-going cycle of the same routine, with little variations. Summer break should quite literally be a break from that, allowing students to stray away from the same routine. For this reason, schools should encourage creativity and free-will through summer projects. Furthermore, allowing students to design their own project gives them a sense of control which might encourage students to actually complete the project. 
Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. 
In the passage it states that Luke(or I) got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. He also visited an excavated castle in Crete. I also marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I loved it So I know you will. You should also go to help others that need help. 
Clubs like "We the People" are great for those who are interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for exercise, to no one's surprise. They are a wonderful way of expanding horizons, making friends and exploring new things. 
I feel as if driverless cars are just the fact of people being lazy 
This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney"Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis." 
Having the use of this technology in school will cost too much money to build 
Alongside to having an accessible teacher, learning in school with other students significantly contrasts to an at-home learning experience. As students attend school with peers and teachers, their value of education can increase because they are going to a place everyday where being positive and respectful is encouraged. These key factors that are found in a school is what influences a students' character and attitude towards their education. 
You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! 
The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. 
students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group. 
The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth. 
"The presidentail election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...." I took it as the Electoral Colleges is the ones to chose the out come of it so why do we vote then if they chose at the end of all of it. 
But that's what further devlopment is for. FACS will keep pushing and making more progress when being able to tell a person's emotion. 
it tells you where your students are bord in class, see if they are mad in class, and tell someone is tired in the classromm. 
This is not an alien creation if it were there would be arms, legs, or maybe a body poking out of the sand and rocks. But if it is something we probably wont know for another century or a few decades. But if there is extra terrestrial life on Mars we won't know for a very long time. If aliens did create this then where are they, did they just leave Mars or get wiped out. 
Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. 
It may have some bad effects 
Do you use your cell phone while driving? More than half of car accidents that occur are caused by drivers who use their cell phone while driving. Maybe you should think twice about using it while you are driving. Drivers that put a hand on a cell phone while driving can cause them to get distracted and cause an accident. The car accident can lead up to taking a human's life. 
Briiiiiiiiing!The bell signals and the sound of shuffling papers and zipping bags begins as people pack up for their next class. The teacher bids farewell as their students trickle out the door into the busy hallway. Students chat as they meander to their next classroom. Settling down, they pull out their notebooks for their lesson. The teacher begins, interacting with them and receiving questions. While this seems like a standard snippet of a high school experience, there are many factors that would be lost if school began allowing the use of distance learning 
Also if other people found out your secrets and things they can get spreaded and start rumors and other things that can be bad for you. 
so that the office workers job would be much quicker because no lines would be used up by any students needing to call home or wherever they must call, they could just use their cell phones. 
Though driverless cars may be a thing of the future, my vote is a no. Driverless cars are a bad idea no matter who is behind the wheel. 
The last passage explanes what I've been saying less people are buying cars why invent new things . People are going unemployedment an things aren't going to get any better for our country . The governments are asking for to much plus you have taxes an the IRS right behind them waiting to grab your money that you worked hard for . Another thing that I don't get is why the President of the untied states can help other countries but yet can't even of seem to help his own country who is lossing more money as days go by . Whats going on up their in the white house we the people slecet you the president to run our country not others an help benfit us. 
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," by Nick D'Alto, describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. There is a paragraph where it can detect students facial action, 
Why ould support this detail? because of so many life forms on Earth people assume that someone had to make that happen. Perhaps aliens did indeeds have something to do with the "Face" , why would they make so clearly and if they did , why did updated cameras show that the clearer the image the face slowly decided to dissapear. 
the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable 
They can create a warm and fun learning environment for the pupils, which can lead to them successfully gaining the knowledge they need to move on in life. The way a student acts in the classroom can affect many others around them and their attitude towards learning. If a teacher can detect even the slightest bit of negativity in the classroom, they can stop the spread and do their best to make learning fun and relatable for the students. 
I think they should do it because community service it a great way to interact with younger children and the community. 
That is not right. When the people vote for something or someone they should be able to have a final say in what happends. Say your voting for a new ice cream flavor, well say there is 20 regular people voting and there is 5 from th e"electoral college". Say 13 of you like the new flavor but the other 7 dont like it. Wouldnt you think the 13 should win? But the 5 electoral people still have to vote, and 3 of them vote against the new flavor so there is no new flavor. Wouldnt you be mad if you and the other 12 people who wanted the new flavor didnt win because of higher people above you said no? i know i would. 
and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons 
. With useing this process citizens sometimes do not have control over who their electors vote for, also voters may get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. 
At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called "Generic_Name's Work Zone" or "WWZ." WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be. That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them. 
they would be unhappy, 
However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth. 
But, as much as the Electoral College may not seem beneficial and fair to some it can be a good thing also 
The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1) 
The idea of allowing students to use cell phones during free time makes absolute sense 
Any technology we have is not 100% reliable. The system can break down in the middle of the road, and someone could die. We should not risk our safety or our lives on a machine that is not fully safe. 
Cleaning up trash is also a good thing to do because your helping make our world a cleaner place. 
because you probabaly dont know what people been through 
When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path. 
Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space. 
In 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made. 23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public. Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication. Smartphones. For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them. In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7. People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving. This is probably the worst thing about cell phones. Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults. 1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving. 
if the student's play sports the coches can know when the student is sad, tired, happy,or angry. 
State Senator I disagree on keeping the Electoral College! For only the electors choose who is going to be the new President 
The Electoral CollegeNEEDSto stay. If we get rid of the Electoral College the amount of votes in popular voting would be low to determine who they should pick. The Electoal College is the biggest reason we do so well on presidental winners. 
Lastly, it helps students get involved in what around them. 
I think it's better to combine both ways. 
they will be fun to do in the summer, 
I know this machine could be very useful 
It is amazing because some people do not feel as loved at home, but in school they feel loved. 
in the second story it states that"the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best".mostly voters should have the right to know and undrstand everything that goes on while there voting they should be aware of the candidates all of the people behind the candidates such as the extra democratics and republicans that stands behind that certain candidate. never the less I believe thatthe popular vote process is a great idea and that we should stand as one ans abolish the electorial college. 
to make better choice for you , to make better life to work hard study ask teacher for help. 
so its a landform with a face but the shadows make up the face. NASA has been studying this for a long time,but for what ?, as you bcan see its just a landform not a face. 
by the way, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible and it hat happend before 
I know you don't like us using our cell phone 
It's also very beneficial for some students to attend classes from home because some of them have problems at school or gets bullied. 
If adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule. These are the main things that students need to be successful. 
however, they are wrong because distance learning reduces chances of receiving or giving illnesses and gives students a chance to not fall behind in school. 
Many students will agree that a commonly enjoyed perk of going to school is to meet and mingle with friends. However, when students study on an online forum at home, they do not get this opportunity to engage in conversations with peers as there are lesser chances to forge a personal bond with the students in the class. If learning online removes some of the greatest opportunities a student has to establish bonds and friendships, is it really worth it? Students need to know the faces and personalities of the people in their classes to gain a confident observation of each of their classmates' beliefs. Lighthearted conversations with one's peers are a key to developing relationships, and without the assistance of such relationships, students are likely to lack motivation in their goals and studies. Additionally, students will lack motivation in their coursework if they have less need to participate during lectures. An online study forum greatly hinders a student's ability to communicate with peers and take part in group discussions. These discussions are essential for a student's success in core classes as they captivate the student and make them play an active role in the class. Being an active learner provides students with the necessary skills to communicate with the professor and their peers, as well as to actively observe the essential components that are being discussed in the classroom's environment. The lack of opportunity to discuss topics with another student can create an uninteresting perception of that class and make students less inclined to partake in class activities and lectures. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending classes at home as they will be less motivated to partake in the class when their abilities to create relationships and be an active learner are hindered. 
One reason as to why people should not be able to use their phone while driving is because the risk of death is so high 
Getting around will be easier, and everyday life will seem a little less chaotic. 
It may be mistaken that it is unhabitable for humanity, but there is a possiblity for humanity to live on other planet. There is reasons for saying those things about Venus. This is an other aticle to explain why Venus is habitable for humanity. 
the work wouldn't be the issue, 
Another reason why you should ask multiple people for it is because some people maybe giving you the wrong advice 
presidents are elected every four years. Some presidents make changes some presidents don't, society  strongly believes any president elected should make good changes. Any citizen from any state want's the president elected to make a difference, thats clearly one of the presidens duites. Presidents sometimes do not compensate for the mistakes they make that they're not supposed to make 
because it will help them to be responsible by a way that they don't want to loose a day of class, thinking about a person if helping them and it can help them, 
In my sight community service is essential. 
Another great reason that online classes are beneficial are that the class you want may not be offered at your school so you can take it online from your home 
quicker and easier to get a final decision, 
If we have people that have more knowlodge then us then, we can have a good President. 
The author backs up his suggestion with great evidence, but does it in a realistic way. He realizes how dangerous it is to study, but pushes for it by bringing up how little we know about Venus. The author's suggestion is correct and scientists need to find a way to study Venus. 
The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be[overuled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the part's nominee; however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservaative reasons 1) Certainty of Outcome 2) Everyone's President 3) Swing States 4) Big States and 5)Avoid Run-Off Election.               
While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, "residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..." (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests. 
When facial facial expressions a made its about muscular action units. The school computer shouldn't have to know how you are feeling. What kind of problem is that supposed to solve 
In the Electoral College they avoid the problems of the elections which no canidate recevies a majority of the votes cast 
some time students take action and going to visiting some place they will be attend online classes. now every area social online. 
it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships, 
This technology could seriosly improve schools for the better and allow them to forever change how we learn. Students could be individually taught, and they would always learn because the computer would still know if the student is confused or not. This could create worldwide peace because students could fully grasp from histories mistakes and continue to forever make the world a better place.   
others believe that we should keep the Electoral college 
There is also a possibility that we wouldnt have to go completely without cars. We could go to electric or just find a totally different resource to run a car. I am sure there has to be something else than just gas that could run a car. It amazes me how we make all these crazy futuristic inventions but we cant make another substance to run a car. I think we should stop worrying about just stopping car usage completely and try to make something else that will run a car. 
My friend Generic_Name was sick not that long ago with the flu, and missed all of her classes for a week straight. Even though she did her work, her grade and attendance suffered because she wasnt able to show up to class, and most of the absences were unexcused. If classes were online, she would be able to log on, and get her attendance points, and her points from the curriculum. People could disagree and say that students would get lazy, and not long onto the program to do their work, however those students would still have to face the consequences of a lower grade and possible detention,or a mark off for not signing into the programs. Its really the same as a regular class, it just offers the comfort of home, and personal resources and still gives students the opportunity to get the help they need. 
little Johnny can relate with the problem of having a dirty town. Little Johnny was walking home from school one day when he noticed a gum rapper on the gray sidewalk, he picked it up and threw it in the garbage can. he continued walking home when he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. he picked it up and put it in the garbage. a few minutes later he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. but this time he was mad so he ignored it. that afternoon he told his mom and dad about what happened after school, and they said it didn't matter, and that it is not there problem. the next day he was walking home from school when he found another gum rapper on the sidewalk, so he pick it up and brought it home to his mom and dad and the all wrote a letter to the major of his town saying that they should pick up all of the trash on the ground. and they did. 
If you chooses the other on people are still going to bring their phones to school anyway so why not let them have it at school just have rules for them not consequences. 
Run-off elections, as known as, the gigantic issue with a popular vote election system 
Secondly, The land erodes over time 
It is possible for a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote. 
Being with the people you love is so important so why wouldn't schools want to promote and value that rather than force their students to have schedules full of an unnecessary extra curricular that a student may not even want to do. What if you wanted to go to the mall with your cousin whos only in town for the weekend but you can't miss soccer so instead you spend 2 hours running laps and passing a ball, it would make anyone like that sport a little less. 
It shouldn't be a priority for students to help. It should be a decided thing whether the student wants to or not. Kids all want to have fun and most students don't want to spend their time doing community service. So why make them? Let kids have fun, let kids decide whether or not they want to do community service. Its the right thing to do. 
take for instance the George Bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. Im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best. 
This is a good way to help people to what if they are going through something 
Secrets and stories are also forms of advice because someone is telling you what happened in their life and how you can avoid it so it won't happen to you so when was someone is trying to tell you something important always listen it would probably keep you safe and out of trouble so if something goes down you were not involved in it so no one can blame you for something that you never did or was not even a part of, 
This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community. 
What if someone's family member is pregnant and goes into labor during class? Would you deprive them of getting updates via text? 
Sparkling lights filled the room while blush colored flowers made a trail down the isle. The room had a peachy aroma. People slowly entered the church and the murmurs of voices were filling the air. Generic_Name was in the back dressing room getting her large, white gown fitted on her body. She was getting married to the love of her life. Generic_Name was a dove. Generic_Name was graceful and delicate. Nobody could ruin her day"Generic_Name its almost time to walk," Generic_Name's father called out. She could hear the soft music playing. Butterflies fluttered around in her stomach. She could not believe how almost four months ago she was going to meet up with a man from a dating website. The thought made her body cringe. If she would have went on that date, she would have never met her soon to be husband. Generic_Name was in love and happier than she had ever been. She was so glad she listened to the opinions and advice from her friends and family. 
education at home provides far more accessibility to distractions and cheating than in a supervised classroom 
The ones who fought in battle against Britan. They sacerficed their lives to get us where we are today. Its not just a law, its what connects us to our ancestors and its what makes us unique from most nations voting systems today and back then. 
And they are not the only one's who have said it. According to the gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral collge, won the popular vote but lost because of the 60% of his voters prefered a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency 
it is a non-democratic method 
NASA should stop taking photos of the face because they already have enough pictures of the face to look at. In 1976 the took a photo of the face by using Viking 1. Nasa argues that they can get better views when take new photos. critics argue that you dont need that much of photos to figure out what the face is. In 2001 they used the Viking to take a photo of the face and they got back a good photo. 
How does the idea of cars that are able to be used on it's own sound? As in the article, it states that driving laws want to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If we go "smart" everything will be technology based. Which is just one reason for an internet crash and more technical problems. 
Home schooling shows us more about our future. Whoever thought that students would be able to take classes from home or even through video conferencing? 
Having fun, making new friends would be amazing. 
Third, it can easily detect someones emotions. 
The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways. 
Learning is very important and having the project is a good idea. The students must be able to choose exactly what they want to do. 
Having multiple perspectives on something allows you to know how your decision will affect your future 
I think that students should have to do community service. 
many people out there, in the U.S, feel the same way as I about the Electoral College. Many of us feel like we are worthless, like we don't matter 
In the end, cars are still one of the most common and one of the greatest things on Earth today. Getting a first car is a dream come true, but too much of it can be harmful. So get some use out of the bicycle, avoid poisoning the atmosphere, and cars will be a vehicle with no reprocautions at all, and it will be the perfect source for transportation, while keeping your morals where they should be. 
it more easier then any other method 
The students needs someone who knows how to teach and has been teaching for a while. 
But you have to understand that the young people now are at the age of technology which means that we are more comfortable with technology than our ancestors. You have some kids now that can make technology run around in circles, because that's what has been imbedded in to their brains and it just comes naturally 
For everone to get used to these rules could cause many fights and arguements between peopl. The chances of a cadidat of winning could change alot. 
Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a $40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use. 
Consulting others for advice can help you do that. Perhaps your situation isn't as horrible as you thought, maybe it could be easily fixed and dealt with. People other than yourself can help you see the good things in bad situations. You could have this sense of relief from just consulting someone for their opinion. Simple as that! 
This new technologyis the same technology for making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or surgery. " Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication " that Dr. Huang had. Computured need to understand that, too " said Dr. Huang.Your personal computer can't handle the complex of the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. 
creativity of the project completion. 
they might not be interested in any of the activities offered at school, 
A student-designed summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves 
"Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President." The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electors that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President. 
second scientists are also finding a way to make these probes and pods to withstand venus the planet. 
But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person. 
Another example, would be the pictures that the scientists have taken 
NASA has thought of sending humans to study venus to see how the conditions are up there 
I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game. 
A grade B average is enough because it's not too low and you're making good grades and such. 
,before, offering or option this idea the ministration of education should think about all things and compare all things, the ministration of education should take and ask everyone ideas, for offering or option, may be the majority of people will not like this big change in education filed, with this offer or option their will be change in everything in life, as, I told before, changing in humanes natuer and life, like not commnicate with people, for away from different culture and society,and will perfer to be alone, as I told online calssse and watching videos are not helpful for students , this offer or option not benefcial for students who takes online classes,and taking school classes helpful for stdents 
phones should not be aloud to be operated by a human in any sort of way while driving. 
for instince like it says What is Electoral College? section 10, "If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for Jonh Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry." then he would get 34 electoral vote. 
I don't think it's necessary to even have it at all because what's the point if the votes aren't equal for all states? it's a very irrational process. 
That same student approached one of my colleges they have the same opinion that I do and the student is now contradicting what he so desperately needs to believe.Although seeking multiple opinions is a good thing to do your opinion almost always comes out on top no matter the consequences. 
The benifit of having the electoral college is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratie method of selecting a president that will handle his job and do what he is supposed to do. 
The prior classes replaced my energy with stress, destroying my brain's ability to function. Because of stress in school, classes should be accessed at home. 
What if they need a for or something important they could call their parents and ask their parents to bring it to school. 
Most bullying is because of the way someone looks or acts when they stay at home no one can make fun of the way the look or act. 
In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state doesnt't have the sam eamount of people in each, the chances of there being a tie in the presidential election, is slightly unlikely. Other then there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the votes add up tp 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election is confusing as it is. I say, we should get rid of the electoral college. It's not needed 
Attending an online course would help them in that manner of not being comfortable around others. 
However, because of some reasons that I mensioned above, studing Venus could be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.   
it is unfair to the people 
Learn something from more then one person because they help you dont get in trouble and be a good student or son if you learn from someone us. 
The technology used in the article shouldn't be used to read students emotional expressions 
Not only does students designing their own projects give them a opportunity to pursue their interest, but it also gives them ability to express their ideas in a fashion which they are not pressured and limited by others. 
Everybody was born differently, in different situations and in different times. This impacts their experiences, from every moment of their life. 
It could also become a distraction for the students. 
One of the great things Electoral College brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be "overruled" it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. If not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. 
they be trying hard to pull up their grades but it won't wroth it cause you want let them participate because you want everybody that has an "A" or a "B" average. Another reason, why because students would look at you, and say "we tried ", and it would not be right to see other students playing. 
The use of cell phones and other handheld devices make daily life in the 21st century easier and more convenient than it has ever been 
We have expressions every day but sometimes can be hard to tell how we are feeling. Most people dont know how other people feel but this can let other people understand what they are going through. This can also let people track the emotion they want to know if that person is feeling. Yes i do think that this system should be used. It can help alot. This would be very useful in alot of things. 
Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. 
Another example is cleaning up trash on the highway, or anywhere really 
it can influence your decision 
In the pharagh 2, it say, "humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world." Every previous mission was unmanned. You may be asking yourself why , because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours . They belived thats why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus. 
Electoral college is the best way to go beacuse like that will only have one slate of electors. But if the popular vote then most likely will end up with two or more slates of electors and personlitly I wouldnt like that 
and practical 
Luke may have loved all the adventures and great times, but that's only one person's point of view of the whole idea. 
In addition, schools offer free materials and services that are not available at home 
That is kinda funny how can a computers know when your sad or happy. Computers don't have emotions only living things do have emotions.  
Home school isnt so fun when something happens at home and you have nobody to talk to or nowhere to go. 
nobody lives on Mars it's just a empty planet. They NASA says that the face on Mars had became a pop icon but i don't think that just because NASA has images that it's ture. You can't always believe people. 
A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous. 
thus, it is beneficial take classes online becuase you don't have to pay money to the school for uniforms and, all the required things that they ask you to buy. When you can save the money,it can be use to pay the classes online. 
The Electoral Collage should be kept instead of popular vote 
Cell phones are extremely distracting because of the large amount of focus operating one requires. 
With this wide variety of responsibilities and commitments, having every student complete the same exact summer project is unreasonable. 
Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.(Source 2 Paragraph 9)Even the voters would perfer majority rule 
The Electoral College voting system has been around for a while 
Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, "For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, "The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus 
Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. 
Mental health is one of the biggest issues for teenagers in today's society. Many students feel trapped in school where they have nowhere to go and malice is inevitable. Students feel stressed, anxious, and depressed from traditional school which leads to their mental health deteriorating. But through online school, students will have a more open environment where they choose who is in and out of their life, so they are no longer forced to be around the people that hurt their mental health. It will decrease in mental health issues but it also allows for more time to be spent with the people they love and care about, which in turn builds their mental health up. Schools force kids to be with one another even if the none of them want to be there. Online school solves this by letting kids have more freedom with the social aspect of their life and do what they feel is best for their mental health. 
Driverless cars would both solve and cause problems in the future, should they become the norm. If not everyone could afford the new, expensive cars, who would be blamed for the car accidents that are bound to happen? Sports that include car racing, such as NASCAR, would be eliminated and thousands of people would be left without jobs and, potentially, on the streets. Though the new cars would create new jobs as well, they would also cause new thefts by employees in companies to better the flow of there income. Driverless cars would cause more problems than they would be worth in the long run. 
an easy way to cheat, 
some kids do prefer social learning environments rather than the quiet. 
When in the comfort of your own home it's better to study, read, and stay focused. For example around students or an area your uncomfortable with can stop you from doing your best. But if you are in a environment that your more comfortable with you can work better. When your comfortable you learn better. 
Persuading a person involves tons of effort and time. You have to know your facts and have tons of background knowlege on the subject. Do you personally believe in aliens? 
In conclusion we should be alowed to let our imaginations run willed. NASA looking ito sending man kind to Venuse. It is the planet that is the ost earth like is several ways. NASA has been studies Venuse for a while now and have found evidene of erth like structures on it.        
is about the indefensible electoral college:why even the best -laid defense of the system are wrong. Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of commerce,and the AFL-CIO all ,in their time agreed on Aboilshing the electoral college. but electoral college you you dont vote on the president you vote for a slate of democratic or republican elector to pledged for what ever president you want to vote for. But if they take electoral college away it will cause a disaster factor for all american that want to vote. But the american are all lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. 
In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.    
In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes. 
the better option are teacher-designed assignments. These summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents, they understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. This structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading. For these reasons, summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students. 
Swing states are a huge deal in this process for they mainly decide the election with the ability to change an election in a heartbeat. 
they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called "smart planning". 
The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus. 
We also have to go home and do some choirs, foils some laundry, take a shower, and eat. That to takes up another hour, lets add it up 8 hours at school 2 hours at sports 2 at community service (which is what you want)+1 at home..._____________That's already 13 hours of the day, and who knows, maybe someone had more things to do, like sports out of school, or scouts, or dance. The possibility are endless and adding this could makes someone day could make it torturous. This also leaves us no down time to read, relax, or watch T.V. 
The student is literally taking the role as a teacher to him or herself. For example, if a teacher is planning to go to Hawaii for the summer, but doesn't have time to create the project for him or herself, then they could ask their students for assistance on that. The students would be in charge of doing the work for the teachers and that could also help with the teachers time management. Another example of how the students would be doing the work for the teachers, if a teacher doesn't show up for summer school and if he or her is absent for it, then they could ask one of their own students to probably be one of the substitute teachers for the summer school. 
In paragraph 8, is states " Venus has value." Only because the insight we have so far on Venus is unbelievable. Studying more on this planet may lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors. 
You have too think children need every minute of their life with education . This cant be during our time of learning that help us when we get older. Children shouldn't do community service not in till they get little bit older . Time is money and money is in our education to go to college and be successful in our everyday lives. 
On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. 
this system makes congress think about its nominations for president 
Granting teacher's access to their student's feelings could give teacher's insight on how well their concept's are grasping. To further prove the computer's effectiveness, Huang states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor," (D'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other's emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships 
This also may turn around the lives of the more "bad" kids that drink and also do other bad things like drugs and stuff. 
You shouldn't use it because you can get distracted easily. 
I belive that Electoral college is unfair in many ways, and maybe it would be good to keep the election by popular vote for the United States 
It helps when picking out what shirt or shorts or any type of clothing they want. When they dont know what type of clothing they want to buy multiple opinions can help a lot when not knowing what to get. It also helps when picking which shoe they want and which one is the best for them. Opinions from parents and the workers that are helping the person will help them see if the shoes fits and if it is the right type for them. It also helps when the person doesnt know which place they want to go to. Getting opinions and ideas from friends will help when picking which place you want to go. Multiple opinions helps a person when making a decision. 
It seems to me that it may or will cause alot more accidents than texting while driving or drinking while driving. 
it gives them a chance to be creative 
attending online classes can help students with social differences. 
if you look at the images in the beginnig of the article, it has three different dates. 
Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are effective, however, student-designed projects are better 
It would be pointless for adults and teenagers to get lisence. It would be pointless to have rules of the road. 
The final reason that i think forced community service is not a good idea is because kids need sleep. 
While there may not be other students there, there are pets, family, and objects that can be destructive to learning and attention. 
In recent years many citicens have stated that the so called "face on mars" is a martion monument. Well I have but one question for those few citicens. Do you have any proof? 
Studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers 
this is fair because if we just had people by popular vote it would be a crazy mess. 
I think it is a good idea that the principle is doing that because some students can have a good B average. 
In conclusion i say just get rid of the electoral college because of all the votes that won't count and all the people that voted and not a single one of their votes goes to who they voted for. If it was by popular vote one person could get majority of the electoral votes but less of the popular votes and if there was no electoral college some of the presidents might not have been president.   
If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously. 
In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that 
On passage 2:The indefensable electoral college says under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the president 
At any rate, most people say that the Electoral College is tuned as an anachronism, a person or a thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit in the present. 
Because of how hot it is it's very dangerous . 
Passage 3: In defense of the Electoral College states that the electoral college is a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by delaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner 
I think we should keep the way we elect our President 
It would have to be hard to sit around and look at computer screen 
I believe it would be a smart idea because then you can tell how they're emotionally feeling 
Because today you see many people allowing or wanting there child to be able to do there work at the comfort of there home. Simply because some kids learn better at home,in some cases it could be there is less distractions surrounded around them for examples class clowns,bullies,girls,friends and maybe even the class pet 
Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc. 
The best part of being a Seagoing cowboy is helping people. 
What about if it was raining how are we suppsoed to get to work or get food. we need a car to get to places. 
in conclusion i do not the think the author wants to visit venus because it is way to hot to even try to land there if we did land there you would melt it says in paragraph 3 that the enviorment would crush a Submarine that is accustomed to dive in the deepest parts of our oceans. venus has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequrnt lighting strikes to any thing trying to land on its surface. 
Students that take online classes do have its benefits. For example, if you don't have enough credits, counselors tell students that are going to graduate if they do or do not have enough credits, they can take online classes. 
for example no fighting , talking to others with disrespect 
when distance learning is applied to hard working students, it allows for significantly better results more consecutively, making it way more effective than the current system set in place. The reason for its better performance is because of two aspects: 
In my oppion they should use the Electoral college to desied who wins the Election. 
The writer states, "The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse" (Plumer).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.  The writer also says, "electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please" (Plumer).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government. 
In "THE CHALLENGE OF EXPLORING VENUS" the author of suggests that studys venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger it peresnts. 
The use of technology to read emotions expressions of student in the classroom is not valueable because technology can never calculate the feelings or expression of humans. 
They could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. If you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they're so bogged down with a to-do list. Students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. Stress isn't good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. Not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. If you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can't add another burden onto their shoulders. You know what they say, All work and no play... 
Yes, your cell phone might be small 
If not, put down the phone and wait until you are at a light or until you get to your destination. No notifications are worth someone's life or yours. You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people's friends dead because they couldn't wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn't mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead. 
If there is already an apparent list of five reasons all about retaining the Electoral College because of its democratic pedigree, just is another reason as too why I'm against this kind of voting system. 
But also is depent waht classes student do you are,because some student are lazy when they work at home. 
The technology to read students emotions isn't a very useful thing. 
One thing PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME suggest, "Lot of kids are in different programs here, but not a lot of the kids know each other. We purposely put kids in different groups to learn about each other." That is a cool idea. I feel that at our school not everybody knows each other, having those actives, I believe could solve that. For example, I was in this club at my school and I had no friends in it and I didn't really like it because of that. Then I started talking to people and I started to become really good friends with some people that I am still friends with to this day. 
And if the students have there phone out during lunch than it's ok but if they have it out during class than the teacher can take it away and send it to the principals office. And the principal can take care of it and call the parents and tell them that your kid was using his/her phone during class so we had to take it away from him. 
This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. 
With traditional schooling methods, students are placed in classes of as many as thirty peers all trying to obtain the same education and lesson within the time constraints of the class. As with any large group of adolescents, some students will quickly catch on, while some will take longer to grasp the material. However, when one teacher is controlling a classroom of thirty different learning paces, they have to attempt to find a happy medium to teach the curriculum, and they are additionally limited to the constraint of a 45- to ninety-minute class period. This leaves the quicker students bored and unsatisfied while the slower students are left to struggle to continue to catch up to the teacher's pace. This issue is especially prevalent in an AP or college level class, where there is a lot of material thrown at the students at once. With distance learning, however, students have the benefit of learning at their own pace. Because of the eternal availability of the internet and email as well as abundant resources both in virtual classrooms and on the web, students are able to quickly tackle the subjects that come easy to them while also able to slow down, ask questions, and get additional help on topics that they struggle on. By not having to conform to a teacher's pace, students are more likely to succeed at their own pace, which is encouraged through distance learning. 
People are dying because they wantTheir girlfriend/boyfriend to think their cool. We are also hurting ourselves by putting us and a badCrash we are getting hurt. 
Technologies are being created in many types of cars that prevent accidents before they happen. For instance, many cars are now being made with breaks that stop themselves when they sense that the vehicle is in danger of hitting something/someone. Some other companies, like GM, have developed Driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into an object so that the driver can take control. Many "heads-up" displays like this one are being created to prevent tons of accidents and possible deaths and/or injuries related to driving. 
Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien 
I think Policy 1 would be a better policy then Policy 2 
If you want some good done you should encourage community service more but don't require it won't teach anybody a lesson if they did not chose to do so themselves. 
Another reason students like I and others should be required to perform community service is because we need to clean up our community. 
"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.    
However, in high school, it is better to give students more freedom because in their careers they will not always have someone telling them what to do every step of the way and they will have to think for themselves 
but it would be good for them to learn their consequences. 
Additionally the winner take all method in some states makes voters feel unimportant. 
Many conspiracy theorists thought that this could actually be evidence of life on Mars 
Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of theUnited States because everything is label right. 
It should be popular votes take all. 
president obamas ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse emmissions, unveiled last week ,will geta fortuitous assist from an incipent shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that america is buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer liscenses as years go by. that has left researchers pondering a fundamental question:has america passed peak driving? the united states with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the worlds prime car cultures. it is the birth place of the model T; the home of detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "mustang sally" just kidding im not gonna copy all of that. 
Another major reason I have in mind is that some students work to help them selves or the house hold. 
Although these are all fair reasons to want to visit Venus once again, astronomers have to keep in mind all of the negative characteristics that will set their exploration behind. 
Skeptics may believe that the face could be more proof that aliens exist in outer space 
To begin with, I think the principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons that will help you in the future. 
because We do not have to go to School and we can have more time with the family 
Each person interprets everything you say differently and think about things differently. for example I was wondering if I should start writing an essay now or wait a little bit and brain storm. I asked my mom and dad what I should do and my mom said that I should think and do a little bit of it now, then later go back check it and do a little bit more. I didn't even think of doing that and it goes to show that asking multiple people can provide new ideas and ways of thinking. According to a philosopher if man gets caught up with work and close his mind to other ways of going about it, he will need someone else to open it for him. this explains that different opinions can help one open their mind to different things and make better decisions 
Are driverless cars the right choice for our future? 
My friends do not like community service they think it is a waste of time and energy. 
It could be easy conditions to some humnas, but not all. 
the elderly has lived through history, 
One reason why America strives is the fact that we are a democracy, where every one gets a say and we are not ruled by a dictators or communist. The electoral college in no way follows our democratic system, the people are not voting for our president our electors are the ones voting for us. 
learn new things, 
Other students need there phones incase of an emergency, and there parents need to contact there kids or the parents need to be contacted, the school can use there phones. 
Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAMEand I wanted to talk to you about the cell phone policy with you. 
Seeking multiple opinions will help them decide which opinions they would prefer to help them pick from. This person could have a number of options to decide from so that they will get more ideas for the advice they could recieve. Asking for advice from one person is not a very good way for getting opinions, because that person will not have as many options as a great deal of people could have. The person getting advice should not decide on one person to get opinion from because they might not get as many ideas as they would like to get. Having more opinions to influence from can make up a huge decision for a person that is seeking more to options. 
For example, one of my friends is diagnosed with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactive Disorder(ADHD). She gets distracted very easily, especially in a classroom full of students. My friend getting distracted constantly by the noises of a student tapping their pencil, someone coughing, or simply the presence of many people in a classroom has a largely negative impact on her school performance. For her, distance school would get rid of a good amount of those distractions, and help her focus more on her schoolwork. Therefore, some students who have personal complications, and taking online school would boost their educational performance. 
Some may argue that you can make a best friend with the people you go to church with, 
But most of the robots they send to Venus get destroyed because of the choas that happens there. Another project that they did was that they used technology called mechanical computers. These mechanical conputers are are powerful, flexible, and quick but the are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions. 
What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife. It's different how the Da Vinci code is, with converting their specific emotoin with the new electronic code.    
but whats best for us might not be want we want, it might not be what we think is best for us why does are vote no longer count? 
havind driverless cars could be a big terrible deal. 
Teachers need to stop categorizing all students and start looking at us one by one. Teachers should know each students strength one by one but they don't. 
It think we all think thatevery one should yote and know basic back ground on who there voting for, and avoid  run off elections. 
It only makes sense for a receiver of free services to return the favour in one way or another. 
So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself. 
Second in the artical it said "it spotted shadowy likeness of a human face" which can mean that when the picture was captured the camera could have of captured some shadows to which can create an illusion of a face when in reality it could be the showdows. 
Obesity is a big problem in the United States. So instead of us just getting excerise of maybe 20 feet to walking to the car, and then the 45 feet to walk to where we need to go. 
So what NASA did was they built a big camera to take pictures of it to prove it was a big rock which it was a huge budget problem for them but they still did it. 
in the election of 2012 Barack Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Mitt Romney 
They use examples of here on earth and they talk about the showdows. They even talk about how the resolution of photos could change the perspective of those photos. 
You are sitting in your chair. The plastic hurts your legs and back as it curves in an uncomfortable position, ill-adapted to your person. The intolerable buzz of the air conditioning that does nothing to cool the over-heated room drones at your ears, making it impossible to focus. The dull, artificial bulbs that in no way compensate for natural sunlight burn away at your eyes, giving you headache after headache. The other kids are yelling and blasting music, talking instead of doing the work you have been told to complete in an unreasonable, almost impossible time. The work you are doing makes no sense to you and you feel incompetent as those around you breeze by effortlessly. You need to ask the teacher about your work but shes busy grading papers, paying no attention to the class you have been forced into. You can not focus on a single word of your assignment, and even if you could understand it, you would not be able to complete it, because that same day youve already had three tests and two quizzes and all you want is to go home and take a short nap to recharge your brain. You long for some solution to your endless problems in the classroom, and you realize there is another way. 
That's all I have to say 
In this articule explain us how the computers now can check one smile and know if is a fake smile or a real smile 
they are tailored to the unique curriculum the student will be taught with. 
My response is that a classroom computer that has FACS(Facial Action Coding System) can help the students lessons and making them understand easier. 
Sure, it may be alright to walk whenever you may feel to 
Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding. 
I think it would be a beneficial option to implement into the school systems in the long term. 
really they are still learning 
Then, Venus is known to be Earth's sister planet! 
One can go through the lesson at their own pace; being able to move forward or go back to certain information, if they move a little slower or faster than the average. People could have slightly different learning abilities, and need certain resources. For example, someone may need a dictionary to understand. However, with electronic learning, these resources are right at your fingertips. 
In my opinion, community service is like a thank-you to our environment, neighbors, and government, especially in such a hard economic time. 
Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. 
Those were my top three reasons on why we should keep the electoral college. 
"the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor" this sentence from the "Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" explains that it is very peaceful because theres no noise, 
Teachers know more about the topic and could give them different ways of learning 
Some are asking questions like " Can we actually calculate emotions?" or " How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express our emotions?" I as of the rest of the curious world would want to see how this new technolgy works. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are working to make this to only bring smiles to someones face each day as shown is paragraph six. Dr. Huang believes that students doing homwork on a computer usually become more bored while doing something boring on a computer, so Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman want to have a computer know about your feelings like people do. 
The advocates of this position are correct in argung that the Electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the preident, not the people"(Source 3 paragraph 1).This quote states that the people are not the one who chose the president it's the electors. So if the people are voting and the votes dont do nothing what the point of voting? 
All these alternatives are a great way to live a healtheir life then to just let machines do the work. 
according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. This means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better. 
First of all, many kids at my school do not have enough time to do any amount of community service. 
Taking a student out of sports and other activities will not promise higher grades. 
First, in the passage it states that I had to feed and water the animals atleast two or three times a day. Second, if you are eighteen you could get drafted. That's another way to help. In the passage it stated that I could get drafted, so they told him to stay there and keep working with the Seagoing Cowboys. Third you also get to help work with the Seagpoing Cow boys. If you are a good worker and kind this would be a great job. If you like the Seagoing Cowboys you will like the fun. 
So with the Electoral College, the electors that are chosen might not elect those who they said they would. But with election by popular vote, the person elected will always be who the majority of the country wants as president. 
In conclusion america should have a popular vote not an electorial college because the peoples vote should matter. If you want a fair and honest goverment everyones vote should matter equaly and there should be no electorial college. If you care about what the american citizens opinions and what they have to say get rid of the electorial college. 
The part that got me the most was when 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts, I feel that's a good idea because some students are afraid to ask for help in front of the class. They said'the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face' which is also a good thng. " Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion, but also may even help produce them' which is also good. 
You never know you might like something you never tried out before. 
I think the students would listen to him he is a nice principal. 
With the teacher designing the project, they could make a clear and distinct rubric. This would inform students exactly what the teacher is looking for. It is very difficult to complete a project when you are not sure how it will be graded. Teachers would be able to help students and answer any questions they may have. For example, over the summer, Generic_Name has an assignment to research her favorite U.S. president and write a paper on their life. The teacher provides an over view of the assignment, a list of all the requirements, and a rubric. Generic_Name would like to add a page on the president's children. However, she is not sure if that is allowed, considering that the assignment was only on the president himself. She sends an email to her teacher and asks her question. The teacher is able to answer her question almost immediately, because the teacher knows exactly what they want. The teachers should formulate the projects, so they can assist the students and guide them. 
One way the athur say in the text is " a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". 
Venus is a very hot planet. If a blimp was 30 miles above Venus, the temperture could still reach the blimp. That is not survivable for humans 
I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. 
he describes how going out there would be like by saying imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above theroiling venusian landscape. Also at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tha air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth 
when the candidate promiss may be the compleate oppsite once there president. 
Having the ability to partake in classes and obtaining the same knowledge as your peers while being in a different area as them, makes you feel like the illness never was there in the first place at all. This allows the users to learn at the same, or sometimes even faster pace than regular students in schools. 
Also because if you have an A and your doing things to keep that A and you accidentally didn't turn in your homework for a class you could be kicked off the team for not having an A. Some people are smart and some people have trouble with their school work well if your not very smart then you can help it if you cant get that B to an A average. 
Be safe and put forth your best effort in what you do and what happens. 
for example say if Jhon Snipes is running for president and he has a bad criminal record and he only got twenty percent of the votes and the other canidate had the majority of the vote and Jhon Snipes won. He would probley turn the United Sates into a war zone. See this is the main reason why want someone president and barley no one voted for him os her 
Thats how it was back when our founding fathers first came to have there frist president and thats how it should be now. 
My third and final reason is with the electoral voting system there is actually a chance of tying. 
When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. 
The limitation of car usage betters the environment. 
Students may take it as unfair, but they do not realize that without education, they have nothing. 
FACS is a wonderful thing look when phones and computers where being ivented people douted and said its a terrible idea or it will never work, Now its one of the best iventions thats ever been created. FACS is and will be a great thing to many people, school and companys it could save lifes 
In light of recent events, online school is becoming a very sensible path for many schools in the near future. 
Most of the time when students have to do projects, it is based off of a subject that is being taught in school: Such as math, history, and science. Letting students be more creative could also allow them to integrate their summer project into their summer schedule. Such as calculating the total amount of hours they have worked, doing historic research on the family vacation spot, or counting how many steps was taken during a hike. 
Either way it goes we have to earn the privilege to use and bring our cell phones to school. 
students will miss out on many experiences and activities that come along with going to a physical school. 
police are like enemies they protect the streets and I respect them for that but honestly, they should always be avoided I'm not saying avoid them at any means necessary but just keep seat belts on and don't text and drive that's the easiest way a cop will catch you so make sure to get wherever you need to go and just move on try not to get in any trouble. 
If it was teacher- designed, it wouldn't allow kids to express what they've been learning when the teacher is giving them instruction on what do. When kids show what they can do and put into a project, it shows that they've really payed attention and understood the lessons over the years. Also, the projects can allow students to reflect on what they learned and make something creative out of it. 
The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,  the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. 
The last point of evedince the writter used to suppports his claim is the dangerous part oif hsi calim 
Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. 
In 1976 Viking fly to Mars, and when they orbit/circle the mars they see a big head that look like pharoah head. 
may just want some time to them self 
You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. So I'm going to leave you with this. What will you choose? The popular vote of the electoral vote? It's up to you not. 
I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. 
dont want you knowing all about their life. 
The new technology would be able to tell if a student was bored, or if they got confused. Then the computer could modify the lesson for the student to help them learn better. The technology could act like an effective human instructor. Must human communication is nonverbal. Emotional communication is also nonverbal. The studesnts could improve with one on one lesson plans. The studensts could also work at their own pace and have their own personal plans. 
Hands-on-learning is an effective way of learning which makes lessons and concepts a lot more memorable. It's also necessary for science labs and projects. Last year in my AP Biology class, we frequently did labs, which helped me learn the material a lot better than the lectures did. An example would be when we dissected an embryo of a pig, in which I was able to gain a better understanding of anatomy and parts of the body. Group projects also widened my understanding of topics in other classes as well. When we had to use a three dimensional printer to copy the outline of a roman column, a type of architecture, I was able to better understand the designs and features involved in the creation of this type of structure. Online classes wouldn't be able to provide the same opportunity because it would be impossible to perform regulated science labs and complex projects in a household setting. Many students find hands-on-learning activities to be more compelling and memorable than lectures and notes. Due to the inability of distance learning to provide hands-on-learning, it's an ineffective form of education which won't serve as a benefit for students. 
I know that there are some down falls to this technology what if the student or the person doesn't have a problem and just has a face that makes it look like he/she has a problem. 
Second Venus is called the earth twins. why do you ask? Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. 
As Source 1 states, this proportional representation is only done by Maine and Nebraska, but it makes it so that one party wont win the state, it is reigional in the state meaning that more people are represented through this. The winner take all system is too harsh, and can discount many people in swing and regular states. As Source 3 stated, the larger states need to be left alone to represent the US population. Proportional representation allows this with the ability to include even more opinions. With this informatin, it is easy to see how proportional representation will preserve the equality that popular vote represents. 
Huge impediment to current efforts to drostically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes passenger cars are esponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportationStores are placed a walk away on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s. pitted side walks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dromatically cut traffic and new restorants and upscale shopping districts have crapped up. In the United States the rates of car ownership houshold and person started to come down two to three years before the downturn said Micheal sivak who's a reaserch professormof the university of Michigan's transportation reaserch institute study last found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.    
Although the election of 2000 is an example of a problem that shoud be fixed it is not a reason to do away with the system. 
In conclusion, I strongly believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States because; One, it's easier to read when voting. If the Electoral College didn't existed their would be alot of miscounting. Second, everything is label right. Their's no need to get things from the top of your head. Third, the presdient has aot of in trust in people. Us humans gets to finally see if we could depend on him. If he choose's the right group of electors. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States. 
I thinck that the president should not talk to everyone one by one because then that would be just way to long and tireing. 
In Conclusion, the electorial college isnt good and we shopuld abolish then and replace it with the popular vote process nothings better than knowing who your voting for and why. But really think about it does the electorial college really work?    
If your tired of your job and looking for a adventure you can come join the"seagoing cowboys 
caused more problems with voting. 
Next, there are some people that can read others emotion and for it's hard or they can see them. 
But we are glad if the people always think everything in the possitive way and they feel happy and love this life but if they are happy a lot maybe the most of peple that they can not feel their heart or who they love. They will be the person don't have any feeloing that not good to. I mean here you should balance you emoji 
For example, when the pictures were taken, it was a cloudy day on Mars. The clouds casted shadows on the landform to make it look like a face. There were no alien markings. 
The lessons I learned from this experience truly showed me the importance of seeking multiple opinions 
Many are giving up their cars today to make a better, happier living. 
There are many other safe and focused drivers on the road, who are following all the rules of the road. Those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons. 
"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents." 
it can be an important quality for other students to learn the importance of being responsible for their future. 
The dispute over the outcome is possible. As it happened in 2000 
I know, its weired lmao, but its also true 
We all the people should just say that Monday,Tuesday,Wensday we all should drive to school,work or where ever and Thursday,Friday,Saturday they should walk to work or take the bus. 
My name is STUDENT_NAME and as you have been deciding on the choice of making community service a must, I have been asking to see how other people take their views on it 
Nowadays, technology and science became one of important parts in human life, it makes life runs easier. With human's intelligent, technology is improved day by day. Many things are dicovered, or invented that we don't even know about their appearances. One of them is the Facial Action Coding System also known as FACS, which technology could identify human emotions was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. 
The Electoral College process should be kept because of its many purposes and the fact that it was established for a reason 
The planet venus also known as the "Evening star" is one of the brightes in the night sky. Venus is also like a twin of earth the characteristics of this planet is alike except for the speed and the size.A thick atmosphere of about 97% of carbon dioxide covers the planet venus. When you pass that the surface of the earth is 800 degrees fahrenheit and verry deadly to any creacher that lives on earth. the atmospheric pressure is 90% than what we experience here. So why do scientist still study and figure out how life can form on this planet? well...Scientist want to study this planet because they believe it was similar and an earth-like planet. When the planet was and Earth-like planet it could have supported the life that lives on the actual earth now. On venus there were oceans,rivers,valleys,and ect. could we return to this planet? Scientist say that returning to earth is indisputable. Scients also want to figure out how they can send people there and be successfull? NASA want to design a blimp like vhical that can hover over venus without touching the unbarable ground but would give little insight of the planet. Scientist could not take samples of rock or gas or anything eles. Many researchers are tryin to come up with an idea so that they can get all their information on venus. 
A lot of people hate political parties but, I like them 
The first and most obvious reason is safety. 
The improvents cars have made have been done for own advantage 
Having a professional in subjects like math in your vicinity at all times is the best way for a student to get a good grasp on information. Whether it be a professor or a student; The help and guidance of another mind will always have a more significant stretch over trying to learn a subject or topic by yourself. 
Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special". he says)which he is actually me 
it represents the people as evenly as it can 
My position on driverless cars is, that they wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. 
Without them the presidents wouldn't get as much electoral votes from bigger states than from the smaller states. You need more electoral votes then the opponent to win the election not just popular votes. 
how close Venus is from the sun 
They would need to make blimp-car like vehicles they need to hover for miles and miles becuase it's is 170 degrees fahrenheit which means they would burn real bad. and the lights need to be real good because they need to penetrate the dense of the atmosphere. 
we wont be able to get more active, are we 
Some school offer distence learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of line or video conferencing. 
Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home. 
In Paris, France, drivers were given 22-euro fines for even numbered license plates on one day, then odd numbered license plates the next. Congestion was down 60 percent, and this was after five days that Paris' emissions could rival those of major cities in China. France's tax policy that makes diesel fuel more viable than gasoline was partially to blame, according to Reuters. Diesel engines make up 67 percent of cars in France, which is much higher than their European counterparts. Compared to other captials, Paris has a much higher particulate matter as well. It had over 30 more micrograms than the next highest, which is Brussels, mostly due to the cold nights and warm days, which would trap carbon. After the smog was cleared, Paris released the ban on certain numbered license plates.
Students should design summer learning projects because they can create more interesting ways to learn, they can design ways to incorporate their real-world experiences to the academic curriculum, and they can make a project that will not be too difficult for them to complete over summer break. Students can design more engaging projects based on their interests that will ultimately increase benefits such as higher standardized tests scores and retention of material. Their ability to design projects that incorporate the curriculum into the real world will better prepare them for life and work after they complete their education. In school districts where summer projects are used, parents should advocate for student-designed projects to better their children's education. 
The Electoral College method is basically electors that elect the president and not the people which I think is completely useless. 
A lot of these people who suffer are students actively trying to seek an education but cannot because of their condition. If the opportunity were available for these students to receive an education while also catering to their specific condition, they would greatly benefit from it. For example, if a high school student was suffering from crippling social anxiety and clinical depression and could not attend school, the consequences of he/she not receiving an education would greatly outweigh the benefits of he/she staying home for their condition. Not giving the student the chance to receive their high school diploma through online classes is only setting he/she up for failure later in life with little job opportunities and an overall lesser quality of life. If the student were to attend online classes from home, however, their condition would not be triggered due to them being in the comfort of their home and not in a public space, which is a usual trigger for most people, and they would receive an education. Some could argue that providing online classes to students with mental illnesses will only fuel their condition and that it is catering to a budding sense of entitlement, but that is very inaccurate in almost all cases. To force a student that is clearly suffering to go to school is not only cruel, but it also makes the student feel as if they do not matter and that their feelings are invalid. Feelings of invalidity and anger caused by students being in a place they are miserable in is definitely a factor in rising rates of teenage suicide and depression, so to implement a program for online students would not only save lives, but definitely make the kids of the world happier. 
They may be good at math but very bad at ELA. So if they get below a B average in that class they might get kicked off the team. Every person has his own abilities to do a certain thing or class. This is not fair to the people who are not good at everything. If they are not good at it that does not mean that they have to be kicked of the team. 
The next opinion my sister asked for was my mom. I knew even before this trip started that my mom was going to have a very strong opinion on each dress. And I was not mistaken. Each dress came with a "thats too short" or "that shape does not flatter you and the color is to bright." I could easily tell this was overwhelming my sister and stressing her out a lot. And that is one reason why getting multiple opinions can be bad but again sometimes after my mom said that my sister would look in the mirror and realize well maybe it is too short. I think this is one thing that happens a lot. You will put on something you like and when you show it to someone they point out something you maybe didn't think about or realize. One example is when I was at Target one time and I picked out a shirt that I really liked and when I showed my mom she remembered that I already had that shirt. If she had not been there I would have never known that and I would have gotten the exact same shirt I already had. 
The computer software FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can classify 6 basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.The passage states that the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit. The passage also states that using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnintion software tracks these facial movments-in a real face or in the painted face of Monia Lisa. It can even identify mixed emotions. Each exspression is compared against a neutral face 
learning time management skills. 
Home school is better there's some downfalls for it. If you dont study and just look up everything online. Also you aint gonna have no friends to talk to nd joke around with while you doin your work. If your attention spand short home school is not for you. 
No even a space ship or human landed on Venus in these types of conditions. Samples have not even been taken like rocks or gases because of these conditions in Venus. These types of misions can be super risky to do becasue of they extreme conditions the planet has. Earth and Venus are different, Earth has less extreme conditions than Venus dose but later on NASA is trying to find ways to see how they can have protection on there spacce ships and people to try to get some samples from Venus. 
That is why I suggest making a popular vote in stead. 
Also, some kids, including me, may not feel safe at school because of the things that have been happening to other schools like school shootings. School shootings have happened a lot around the world, because of situations like that, it leads students to not feel safe at school. Another reason a student may not feel safe at this school is because the way the school handles certain situations. Like every other school, there are drills, like lock down drills or fire drills. Some students may not want to go through real life drills and they fear a real one could happen. 
I support the electoral college because it allows you to voice your opinions in which who you feel should been president. It's also makes you feel that once you voted that your opinion matters. 
Another way that you can tell is by looking yourself in the mirror. You have muscular units that help you identify how your felling whether your happy or sad. 
Popular voting provides a more direct way for votes from the people to reach their desired candidate as opposed to someone who may not vote for a candidate of their choice. 
In the past the former senaters fought over how a president should be elected president so evreryone argued and argued for days on end because the couldn't decide then they came up with the electoral college. 
I'm in favor of the election by popular vote for the president of the U.S. 
If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion. 
No i believe that they are not the right thing for our future 
You could have a lot of fun doing some activities. 
Additionally, distance learning does not allow for the same hands-on experiences as physical schooling does. 
If you joined this program u could do lots of differents. You would not just do one thing all the time. 
An example of an essential life skill would be communication. If a student is always talking to a professor from their home, they begin to lose their social skills needed to effectively communicate with new and ordinary people outside of home. This can cause awkward, short, and even meaningless conversations in the real world. Stemming from this, finding and making new friends becomes an issue that may take a long time to resolve. Workplace skills are also extremely important skills one can lack when attending classes from home. An educational institution progressively trains students with these skills, for they are necessary in order to succeed in performing well or getting a job. Having situations where these abilities are useful are mainly in the form of doing certain assignments with or without others, listening, maintaining eye contact, and being on time. Looking back, online schooling strips one of the ability to develop skills used in the real world. 
Another external issue that can cause harm or cancel school for students is when schools are under reconstruction which creates distractions and hazardous areas within the school that can threaten the safety of the student body. 
For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it. Also if theres no Electoral College then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
In 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author gives suggestions as to why studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the little details as to how Venus carries a great amount as to how scientists can study to bring actual life to that planet. However, along it comes some safety hazards like extreme temperatures and high gasses in the atmosphere. I can see as to why might Venus be so similar to Earth. Venus is "often referred to as Earth's "twin" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." If having a planet that similar to a living planet why wouldn't we do everything in our power to make a planet that is very much the same as ours. Science has been evolving a lot over the years and I'm pretty sure that with all the technology and theories scientist have came up with them being able to have a study to plan out how to bring life to Venus would probably work at and greater and more things coulud also come along with it. 
They don have to get up for anything or physically move their musles. All of the people are obese. People die from obesity, obesity can cause heart problems which can cause a heart attack. Which can make you die. This is only a chair, imagine what it would be like if it was a car. 
we all have an opinion so lets share it with each other and you may agree and you might disagree but that is life. 
This is why i think we should go to Venus. Or make a ship to Venus. With Venus we could learn many things. Find minarals we dont have on earth. Maybe even find more simalaerities between are planets. 
humans perform the same calculations every day. 
If the driverless cars will have sensors and the driver will have to have fast reaction times to help the car if needed. 
It helps stop waste and pollution. It is safer for the world and its people. Without pollution the world and humans can go on living healthy lives and lifestyles. Not taking care of the world is not taking care of ourselves. The world could end as we know it because of pollution. It isn't safe. 
Secondly we dont get to vote for the president 
Instead we found that the face was but an ilusion! Shadowes were made by the landform creating a non-existant face! 
If you go on the planet you will git to hot to fast and the space sute will malte off of you and if the space sut melt off you will die becuse thare is no oxigen in space the space sute is the onley thing that is keeping you alive. And so that is way we can. Got to Venus quiet yet it will haping in the fucher. In the fucher we mite find some stroger miterole to build better sute and bettre space ships becuse the space shipe we have now cant withsand the heat of Venus the ship wuid melt do to the heat of being so cloes to the sun. The plant venus is not sutibole to land on do to how hot it is the planit venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide covering Venus. Carbon dioxide is not good to brething in it will kill you if you breat to much in. Do to how deadley it is scpaeman have the space sute to keep the alive if thay did not have it thay wood die do to lacke of oxigun but the spacesut has oxigun in it to keep the ware alive. After the spaeman are dont in space thay go back to the spaestasin ware that have oxugine to brethin and that do what they need to do. 
According to paragraph eight you have to be alert at all times. 
It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future. 
this shows that is unfair to vote for someone who takes all the system  in each state, the author also mentions that during the 2000 campaig. seventeen states didn't see that candidates at all, this includes South Carolina and voters iin 25 of the largest media markets, one evidence from the text is when the author mentions that the election is only a few swing voters away catastrophe. 
If students can create their own project that is specific to their life over the summer, then they are accomplishing several goals. It allows them to actually get the work done, instead of being unable to do so based off of their schedule. It lets them be interested in their learning instead of complaining about a boring stack of worksheets that that have to robotically complete. Most importantly, however, it gives them the chance to experience things outside of the classroom that are both personalized to their lives and also accomplishing their teacher's goal of getting them to continue to learn information, ensuring that student-designed projects present the best of both worlds. 
I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because its a fair way to elect the president of the united states. 
there will have to be new laws made for these vehicles, 
It also states that "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidancy." This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. 
Online, the student is limited to a screen with lesson materials on it. Also, schools and teachers are limited to adding documents, websites, and tests online. Because of these limits, the online experience feels dull and straightforward with tests and documents. In a physical classroom, there are lectures, models, posters, and hands-on activities available to the student. These physical resources can help a student remember class materials better through the unique experience they would go through. Unlike the online learning experience, a physical learning experience is flexible and fun to the student. A computer will fail to produce these resources to the students because of its limited functionality from technology. 
Im both with and against this . 
Lastly, this system would not be good to keep students emotion 
teachers always need help at school !! You can baby sit some kids, clean up litter , tutor some little kids n elementary school , ! See community service isn't all about cleaning or picking up trash its about doing something different You can recycle , you can throw and separate your trash into different trash cans to help the economic! 
Like, global warming or green house gases. less trees would be cut down for parking lots or paved streets. 
Students facial expressions show everything you need to know you just have to get something to catch them . Of course they are going to have to make sure its spot on . What if i completely understanding everything and then they start to break it down then what ? Because tehcnology is not perfect . 
If a method like this has worked thid long i think we should keep it until it doesnt work. 
In my opinion, all students should perform community service. 
I am coming to you with this letter because i believe students should be allowed to bring their phones to school if they are smart with it. I would most certainly choice Policy 1 but this is just a letter to persuade you. 
For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. 
In the first story it says " there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking ..." it also says that " passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States." David Goldberg said, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the U.S....who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars, " all of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change". 
Yes, the Electoral College Works because in source one it tells the reader the steps you have to take in order to be able to work. 
For those who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they wont be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling with funding, many see it as unnecessary to spend money on something their child truly doesn't wish to participate in. 
the electoral college is pretty bad. you should make the vote go by poplar demand instead of electoral college 
this creation is something not everyone can afford 
Having this kind of technology to read expressions can be good in a classrooms. 
In this article the Author talks about the dangers of the planet Venus 
Also , community service would be a good idea because it can also show kids how to treat the environment with respect , 
Venus's is plant is formed just like earth But just with too much on it. strate from the" Beyon high pressure and heat, Venusian geologgy and weather present additional impedimments like eruoting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to prodes seking to land on its surface." Some scientist think that venus has youse to look eart and that it youse to support various forms of life,just like earth. From the text" The planie has a surface of rocky sediment familiar such as valleys, mountains, and craters." Thats how the scientist think that venus is just like earth. 
The author states that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
To me I don't like the idea of the software, it can be subatage to someones art. 
538 electors is consisted of and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. this tells me that NO people can vote 
The reason is that, because i understand that you feel that if a student has an F then they shouldn't be able to play. Ok , but if they have a 75 or higher they should play . They have a mid class grade. Now 74 and under you know should not be allowed to play because you need to focus more on your schoolwork than any other sports. 
The cost to make driverless cars is going to expensive 
and be able to do it just about any wear your at and that will be help full to me and othere because im nort allowed to vote yet so it comes in handy in many ways to us and other people to ther united states 
In addition, "The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal tells the reader of the new goals created to cut down on America's greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, the goals, set by President Obama, have been graciously aided by recent studies which show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and have been making less of an effort to get a license as the years go by. With transportation being the second largest source of the nation's carbon emissions, behind power plants, this pattern, if maintained, will most likely have majorly benificial impacts on the environment. 
Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. 
Because we have tried on numerous accaions and have got just a few hours with a little bit of information it is not worth it. Researchers know that they only get a super small time to only see a little bit of a huge planet. 
You can always ask as many people as you want, because everyone is different, and different people have different answers that can help you out. 
Dear senator of Florida. I am here today to tell you what I think about the Electoral College. 
If you pick the first policy the kids will be much happier and the parents happier they don't have to go pick up their kids phone. So please pick policy one. If you pick policy one then the kids will most likely like their principle and not hate her.
Many students may feel better and be less stressed doing homework or school work, because of being in the comfort of their own home or in a space that is safe for them. Students feel free to take breaks and not be restricted to the overcrowded rooms that are common in regular schools. It's also proven that surroundings have an effect on mood and willingness to learn. If the atmosphere of a classroom is sad, depressing, or gloomy, then students may have a gloomy or depressing attitude when in that class, hindering them from learning at their fullest potentials. With online schools, the student chooses their place of study and knows what places motivate them to create high quality work and retain the most information. 
I'm sure most students would agree that teachers really know how to put you to work, while that sounds like a bad thing, it's actually very helpful. Teachers know how to drill information into a student's brain. However, I do understand why students would want to be in charge of organizing summer projects. Students want projects to be fun and easy, usually with as little work as possible, as to where teachers would more than likely want as much work as possible 
As you can see the "EC" has alot to offer and your even included. Why would you want to get rid of something that your apart of 
Every time, theirs a student that doesn't care and leave their garbage on the floor. If we open up this program we could make students more responsible to the school. If the students see the hard work some people take to clean the school environment they would appreciate the work they done and might not want to throw their garbage on the floor like they used to. They would see that since now its them that pick up the garbage and not other people they would be more responsible and throw it the garbage can. 
That one student who was kicked out of the team because she didn't have the grade B average to play on the sports team is now not accepted by any of her usual friends. She is sad and may become depressed. She used to have so many friends and now she has barely any. They all want to be friends with that new girl, who can maintain the right grade average and can play on the school sports team. Now the old girl feels lonely, no one should ever have to feel lonely because of a grade that kicked them off of the team. That is not the right kind. In a school teachers and principals should aim to have all of their students happy and fulfilled, mostly. 
The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote 
i remember one time i got in trouble in school i had to do it i thought it was going to be terrible but after all it really wasn't that bad, i mean it was hard and long but all that worked paid off after it was over my teacher acted like it never did anything wrong because he knew i wasn't that type of child. If i never did my community service i would of have never gotten my respect back for only doing one thing wrong and if you don't have a good relationship with your teacher you will miss out on a lot of fun stuff while your class mates are having all the fun 
It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too. 
My idea is to help reading to little kids or even clean the school. i would like to help on something productive and on something that benefits all 
Do you know that sometime human will not be living on Earth 
There is always the possibility of the disater factor. 
If a particular candidate is preferred in certain areas, the population in or around that area might be influenced to vote for that individual. Also people can be peer-pressured into voting for someone they might not agree with. 
Students are much more likely to branch out from the boring, black and white school project normally set by teachers. Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society. No person is the same as any other. Setting an individual up for normality is setting them up for failure in the real world. 
you could meet new people learn other languiges too 
I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. 
Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. 
I became a Seagoing Cowboy when me frend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was when World War II was going on. Some countries were left to die and had nothing. So they formed the UNRRA and hired ''Seagoing Cowboys.'' Both I and Don Signed up.In August of 1945, they recived orders to go and report to New Orleans.''We arived August 14,'' Luke recalled ''the day the Pasific War ended.'' They got their seaman's papers and and borded the SS Charles. W. Wooster. They then headed for Greace.Before I got to Greace he turned 18 wich ment the military could draft me .''When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip,they tolde me to just keep doing that for my service,'' Luke says.''The cattle boat trips were an unbeliavable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.'' but seeing the Acropolis in Greace was very speacial. So was takeing a gondola ride in Vince, Italy a city with streets of water.''It was also hard work. I had to clean, feed, and care for the anamals. I seved as a night wathman, meaning I had to cheak on all the anamals and report to the captin every hour. One ranny night after my hourly report I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was fine but couldn't work for a couple of days because of broken ribs. I also had fun too and played vollyball games in empty holdes and more. 
This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing. 
I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that. 
i think my school should make students do extracurricular activity at school 
The Face is an actual landform, it was not created by aliens. 
a life without cars means a healthy, long-lasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given "the bird" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.    
Not only does the author describe why dangers are present on the planet Venus, but they also gives analogies in regards to the danger present 
While teacher-designed summer projects don't necessarily allow students to learn about what interests them, they give students the best preparation for the class ahead 
students can strengthen their confident skills 
It says that " venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. 
so how i feel about this hole thong is that is a bad idea and that we should not have even come up with it but that is just me. 
Firstly, a teacher has a certain credibility that students do not 
Although student-designed summer projects are often more in-touch with other students, 
The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding father established it in the Constitution as a compromise between elections ot the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting for the electors wherer they vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. 
Some presidents may have a stronger appeal to some states then others. It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power. "...such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states," is stated in source 3. This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states. 
Firstly, i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions, becaue it is not someting that can just be eaisily told these days and it must have been even worst to tell in the past. I personally beilieve that it wold be best to have somehing that has been woked on by many people and can be very well depended on. These days no one can tell ho someone fels because of their facial expression. 
In order to help kids better undertsand things, not only should we do projects at the end of every quarter during school, we should do them during summer too. 
The author does not support her claim that Venus is worth studying despite the dangers it presents. First, the author only mentions support for her claim in the last paragraph of the article. Second, the author presents a solution to the problem, but says that no data can be gained from the experience because of the conditions of Venus. Third, the author presents the dangers of exploring Venus, and those dangers outweigh the benefits of exploring the planet. 
they have family 
While we should be able to use technology in everyday learning, I do not believe public education should be switched to online schooling 
When you land of venus its dangerous, So people are creating ways that there makigng a ship that will hovering safley around ground condetions that cannot stad the dense of the ground of the atmosphere and rendering phitigraphhy and vidoeography and the most important they cant get smaples on rock,gas or anything else,In that case scientist are seeking to conduct missions on venus.      
People have questions about this "face" on the moon, what does this mean, what next, how did this happen.That will remain a mystery.We have seen strange objects in the sky, strange "ships" and UFO's and what not.But we have never had any proof that aliens exist.we have never seen one, captured one or anything.But we also have never seen them in space.These mysterious objects on the moon are just a coincedince.Until we have proof that we have captured, seen, or caught on camera a extraterestrial thing we cannot say this object was made by aliens.This land structure could be a manmade structure and we would never know it.We would never know if othe people made a trip to the moon.Till we have proof this was not a human manmade structure, it will be a mystery till it is prooved.There ar thousands of craters, dents and all kinds of odd looking things on the moon, what makes you think this could be made by someone or something.It will remain a mystery till we know who or what did it. 
Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly being side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Powerball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text. 
Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President .The District of Columbia Is Allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a process , not a place. The Electoral College is widely regared as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winter . 
Students need to be able to learn on their own and to communicate with teachers on how well they´re understanding what they´re learning. By using facial recognition technology, its taking away their communication skills. There are many flaws to the facial-expression technology that make it a bad candidate to use in schools. It´s certain that there are plenty of good uses for facial expression technology, however using it in schools is not one of them. 
I think that we should change the way we vote by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I feel that this is a good idea and a good way to vote, let me tell you why. 
As an example, Generic_Name is at the shoe store looking for some new shoes for school. He is trying to get the newest pairs of Jordans' because he wanted to be the first at his school to have them, but they are way too expensive. On the other hand, he could get a much cheaper pair of Air Force Ones but then he would look like everyone else. Generic_Name is really indecisive, so he calls his friend to see what he says. his friend tells him to buy the Jordan but they are too expensive. Generic_Name then asks his dad, and his dad says the Air Force Ones are much more affordable and look good too. Generic_Name not knowing what to do suddenly remembers that basketball season is coming up, and the only pair of basketball shoes are beaten up and dirty. Generic_Name then asks one of the employees that work there is they have any basketball shoes. The employee directs him to the basketball section and Generic_Name sees the basketball shoes hes been wanting, and at an affordable price. 
However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. 
The pictures were revealing a natural landform 
that it could also be difficult to pursuit worthy on venus because it could be difficult to study. 
Our government bases off what the people want but the Electoral College dosen't always base off what the people more than what the state wants itself. 
It is said that if we would had popular votes for the President instead of Electoral College,we would most likely have a better chance of getting a President that would be the best at his country then to get someone that is just a favorite of a country of a state by segregationists 
The new technology used to undertstand facial expressions would be a valuable thing in a classroom 
We shouldn't just wait and see what happens, we have to do something about it, because we are all human. If we see someone very depress we try to cheel them up, but what if we can't tell. That's also another example when we should use them. We can stop things from happening, bad things. 
Many states do not have a fair chance to vote 
I propose that we shall keep the Electoral college in order to keep things fair amoung the country. 
the air will be so poluted so toxic that it will be imposibul to breath 
Get to explore places you've never been to! 
Opinion one in some way the children should help out picking up trash and help with other things grownups cant do it all the time 
Imagine you are a scientist at NASA sicussing the face withsomeone who thinks it was created by alliens. 
Your governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertianment" after the presidential election listing all of the canidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Also, the certificate declares the winning of the presidential canidate in your state and it shows the electors that will represent your state at the meeting of electors in December of the election year. Your certificate is then sent to the Congress and the National Archoves as part of the official records of the presidential election. 
In paragraph 3 it brings up "Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness" 
Though sometimes these projects the teachers provide seem tedious, pointless, and "too much" the teachers are usually doing it for the students own good and want to see them grow as a student. These teacher-designed assignments allow them to help students through the school year, guide them through lessons, and develop them as a student.  
Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
I agree with the principal 
To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher. 
a teacher designed, but creative assignment, would be most beneficial to students' learning curve over the summer. By assigning something creative with educational merit, 
In Conclusion, its kinda in between on wanting to have it or not like theyre pros and cons on keeping it.  
The reason why people would most likely not want to change it because they might like voting for an elector and because they might think it is much easier and wont take as long to choose the president. 
Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it, 
if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them. 
cause at some point in time the people will start to get angry about the whole emotions crap and maybe get rid of them, they may like at first but one day their just gonna get rid of it. 
all i'm trying to say is that it cannot be aliens, it's just a rock on Mars. 
so lets put this new computer technolgy to work and lets put it on every school computer. 
People may say that school online doesn't affect friendships. 
they provide people more opportunities, 
Advice is something that can impact a persons view in many ways. It can be helpful or harmful depending on what you say. 
because i know that us students are tired of hearing the same thing over and over again about cell phones killing or taking over our brain sells 
Of course, most of us would have troubles actually describing each facial triat conveys happy, worries, etc.". Just the computer can know the feeling you feel. if we face with an angry face but meanwhile it showing a happy face to us."They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one". By identifity a real smile not a fake one its muscle it go the cheek. A fake smile the mouth its stretched sideway 
I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it. 
With President Obama's issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be. If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete- "and many sociologists believe it will-it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal in her article "The End of Car Culture." By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase. 
I think the help of the elementary kids would be great for them, so they can get work done, and not just have to ask the teacher for help, but they can ask their tutor also. 
The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. 
My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way. 
HELP THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO VOTE 
Not only does this bolster self thinking and creativity, but also it utilizes the summer months, a long period of time, to think about and develop this project. 
People have different ways of learning and getting information into their head. With classes online, one has more control over their learning. 
For example, if you were debating between which outfit you should wear, you would most likely ask for other people's opinions 
I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes for the president of theUnited States,  
The people that are bored being at home should do community service. 
In the age of computers and instantaneous communication, society has an incredible amount knowledge available to them. That said, instead of learning with just pen and paper, why can we not also incorporate online learning into our school systems 
If Bush won because of the Electoral College and not individual votes why did the people even vote?  If noone were to vote then we would still have a president because, the Electoral College would just vote for who they wanted instead right? So why must America vote? 
From the minute we are born we are taught to always talk to a parent or guardian if we have an issue. But there are so many other people you could go to that would save you so much time and effort and they would give the exact same response as your parents. I believe you should always go to a separate opinion from that of your parental guardian and what you will find when you do so, is these other sources can teach you a lot more than your family and they have different experiences from those of your parents. your parents will always want the best and nothing more from you but think to yourself, "do my parents really care about my issue or are they just trying to make me feel better about the problem at hand. So when you are done talking to your parents your decision is not made any easier, truthfully it's become a lot more challenging. Because you have been told what you expected them to say it's not helpful and you are disappointed. 
sports help with physical strength 
In conclusion, I would just like to say that the articles given did not give me enough information for me to form an educated opinion on the prompt. However, I did my best with the articles given. I would like to also say that it would be best for the nation if the Electoral College was either revised and edited, or removed completely and replaced with popular vote in determining our nation's future leaders.    
The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is important. Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments. In conclusion, Venus would be just another planet like Earth. 
you should join 
There is a presidential campaign being held. There are two candidates running. the decision depends on the electoral votes. The Electoral College are the votes that elect the President depending on the majority votes. 
What if its their passion to be competing against people, drive that out of someone they may never have a passion again. 
NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted weeks in such condtions. 
Secondly, students would benefit greatly from attending classes at home because they would save a lot money on transportation and on school lunch fees. 
each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is "unlikely to be a succesful president"( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected. 
I believe that children should be allowed to bring their phones to school, therefore I support policy one. 
Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. 
in overall i agree, i think that students should do extracurricular activity 
There are a lot of astronauts in NASA that are willing to take on the challenge to Venus and NASA has already been simulatiing prototypes to withstand the conditions similar to Venus 
i Believe that students shouldn't be required to do community service. 
You maybe want to change your life 
That way kids would feel like their making a change and getting rewarded that's a great feeling. Some kids think community service is dumb and gross because you have to pickup trash. But if kids get rewarded they will strive to help in their community and stop trash build up on the freeways and out in front of their own houses little thing will start to build up and make kids want to do big things like go to other countries in need of help and help out with them like in Haiti were there is still a lot of rubbish all around. Kids and adults can help out every where there is need of help from the state of Ohio to all across America and then the whole world! 
seeing different point of views, 
Not every person has the same lifestyle as the next, everyone has their own differing personalities and character traits that may or may not clash with others 
but they don't know how fulfilled you feel after you help. 
This could save student's more time in the mornings, and save the school money to enhance their learning experience. Buses would have less mileage and more gas. Student's who drive wouldn't have to worry about expenses towards their transportation. Also larger amounts of people can be accommodated by the school due to less people being physically in the classroom. More money could also mean raises to teachers which would satisfy the ongoing issue of teachers feeling like they aren't paid enough. Students will also be more enticed in a school career due to a larger salary. Schools will run a lot more smoothly and the field would be infinitely more respected by the new generation. 
passionate. 
With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a "blimp" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money. 
some people may think Community Service takes to much time up for then 
I have other opinion for the classes take in the home this classes not is for all students 
Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable. I don't think they're wrong. 
Do you know what the electoral college is? I didn't know what it was or what it did until the seventh grade. Well if you don't know what it is it's a group of 538 people who vote for the next president of the United States. 
I feel like the computer and the humans who are trying to communicate with them are a great way to show feelings and emotions through talking. This program is gonna change the world of technology and the world of emotions for the better of the country and it's people. 
it will give them an advantage at what work will look like when there older, 
This safe environment to pursue interests and hobbies would allow students to explore all kinds of activities and try to see which activities they would like to dedicate themselves too 
There are laws set in place already to ban texting and driving which means due to how many accidents and murders there has been due to people texting and driving on the road. 
In my opinion that is not true because that when you are down or upset you wouldn't want to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raises your eyebrowns when your suprises and around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could shows and tell your emotion at anytime and any place. 
To start, online learning would be especially detrimental to ADHD learners 
voters cannot always control who they are voting for and voters often get confused about the electors and voting for the wrong candidate. 
So, please take into consideration what I've said to you. 
Arguements on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occuring today. 
Well what is bad about the Electoral College is that it is unfair for the voters that is doing the voting. 
For 1 the collage or process its' self is Unnessary jst for someone to cast a vote , when they could really check who they want to vote for on a peice of paper or something 
I believe that most kids don't want to do volunteer work or community service because it doesn't appeal to their interest. 
Driverless cars have always been a big idea for the future. However, there are some really important pros and cons for driverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous to not only the individual driving, but also to everyone around. 
Another issue with cars today is the amount of pollution that cars give off. 
When the people of the state take their vote for the candidates they are actually voting for potential electors who will then go represent the selected candidate, this gives rise to problems like corrupt electors who are dishonest and using cheating tactics, also most states know that their votes will do nothing to help the candidates being represented, examples would be the Democrats in Texas and the Republicans in California. 
The Electoral College is a ominous process, 
The elctoral college restores somke of the weight in the political balance that large sates lose by virtue of the mal-appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The most popular vote in 2012 was by the state of Florida. Obama won that election with only 29 electoral votes. Bigger states get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state does. 
When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. 
"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states." 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom IS valuable. 
a knowledge of how students work based off of experience. 
Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students. 
Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things. In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do. Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, "which paper airplane would fly the farthest." When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given. Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities. 
this makes congress think harder about this decison. 
This will make the students more independent because they will have to the project on their own with no guide or instruciton on how to do it making them do it by themselves. And of course responsible because the student is responsible to get the project done and to turn it in with their own design. Letting a student their own project can help them because could get them to do their work and use their own knowledge. 
so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or she painted on the canvis. 
Every kid does community service every day without even knowing that they are doing it.

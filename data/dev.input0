Although this software may serve as an effective source of profit for online corporations, it has no valueable place in classrooms. 
However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe 
The FACS was desinged to to recognize six everyday emotions. This would be helpful when a student is confused or does not understand what the teacher is trying to teach. 
In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something. They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules. The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. Then is said that if an ad pops up and you are happy then the facial action coding system is going to think you like it then more and more are going to be poping up. Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face. The rusults won't be right. For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results. You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles. That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly. Then it will give you wrong results 
It would be un fair 
I favor in to changing election by popular vote 
if its times for the driver to do his or hers part what if they are on there cellphone like most days now and when they are alterted they look up and its to late. Its relly important that a person is alert at all times and take their own responibility. 
Everyone believed the movie stars and all those other people becasue they have lots of money but they didnt think about intelligence 
Some peope think that the landform was created by alien's, but have no evidence. 
This is what is wrong with the College "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." 
lastly they are also looking into an old technology that has more withstand to that stuff and its called mechanical computors 
When your addicted to a phone driving and using the phone becomes a very hard. There is a new law in Georgia that says if you on on your phone while you are driving you will receive a ticket. 
The two policies are both important to the future of this school. 
individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects 
why should we stop driving cars? 
Most people would think "I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and "...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog." (Paragraph 21, Selsky) Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the enviorment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! "Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic; and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." (Paragraph 28, Selsky) 
Having a teacher designed project is beneficial to both a student and a teacher. Work gets put into from both sides, the teacher and the student, to produce an amazing outcome of a project that meets requirements, was time efficient, and also gets the idea of the project. If it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. The sole reason of a summer project is to show a student learning, if the project was not good, the project had no affect on the students learning.  
eople in the student council and I, believe that is your decision to make. 
It does take a long time out of the day but also it helps the community all together because that's what it is. 
NASA released the photo onto a JPL website once the photo was confirmed and the only thing found was not an alien monument, but a natural landform. 
i think it should stay because it was the best and easiest way to figure out who should be elected for president/vice president 
Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, 
Lastly, this process is outdated and irrational. arguments against direct elections are spurious and should completely vanish this process.    
But I told him that it was a natural landform because when we waited to get the best picture in 1998 all we saw was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. 
I think most students should be allowed to get a couple of C' s because it is a passing grade. 
Students wouldn't be able to have fun and enjoy their lives if they are stuck doing community service. They wouldn't have social time to hang out with their friends. They wouldn't even have time to be with their family as much. Children would be very miserable and would be very depressed at a young age. They wouldn't have to much of a great memory as a child either. 
I do not think community service should be required but it can be an extra-curricular activity 
they will base it off of necessary topics 
I believe that it would be better if students participated in online classes rather than being in school. 
Everytime students hear the word school they all have a similar reaction: "why school." This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. 
By the president being elected off of the electoral process it is allowing the congress to vote and having the congress vote will not put the president we won't in the chair 
In conclusion Senate, Citizens of this country and I believe that we should put an end to the electoral college. Politicians even disagree with the idea of giving specific people to give the final vote. As senator you have the power to put a end to this unconstitutional doing. The United States is a democracy where everyone matters. Because of the electoral college our opinion on who should be elected has been taking away from us. this event is undemocratic and I ask you senator to think this through and take action on making this voting system to a popular voting system 
For some people a "B" average is very hard to get to. 
Venus is similar to Earth by its air pressure being similar to the Earth's sea level pressure, being close to the sun having pleanty of solar power, and once believed to have oceans and support life. 
Teachers pick projects that keep students up to date on what's happening in society. 
some Schools are able to receive them and work with them at school, and other Schools can give you an option to work from your home, Those programs were designed only for people that born sick or have problems since born. 
In 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made. 23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public. Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication. Smartphones. For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them. In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7. People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving. This is probably the worst thing about cell phones. Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults. 1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving. 
Yes , they may be the electors and might have more knowledge of whats going on but they are just people too and everyone is created equally so definitely their votes shouldnt be the only ones actually counted. 
The Electoral College System is wrong. 
When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path. 
Students all across the nation are doing community service to help out their town or city. Whether it is cleaning the streets, helping out in an old peoples home, or tutoring children at a school, all these deeds are good experience and good for the community. 
Some of these cars would only be partially automated and would still require a capable driver at all times, so what would be the point? 
we the people we really can't make good decisions. For instance what they say may blind us from the hard on facts and we'll make a horrible decision just because they can manipulate us with words 
be more creative, 
Why Mona never smile in her painting. The artis make Mona smile into art. The artis try to make her happy into art. Mona shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.The author write about becaues he wants the peolpe to know that there only 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry ina person. The story is best on is trying to make you smile. That why the author write this story. The story is about a smile just a girl smile i always see everybody smile everybody. Making mona smile she probalby don't won't to smile.While looking the in the mirror there a smile in there. Mona smile when happy or angry. Smile is a good thing in your life. two ways to make someone happy in there life be funny, be really funny be like a bunny to make them smile. We peolpe has the same impressive everty day. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. If there a computer know when you're happy or sad that's kinda cool.A new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers to identify human emotions. 
I agree that students should have this Facial Action Coding System in schools. Not only well it help by reading emotions but it may also help for students that want to be actors and people that like doing art and like painting faces. Dr. Huang and his colleague are very smart for makingThe Facial Action Coding System for school.                    
Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday. 
Can you just think of another school likening the idea you had of making kids do community service. You could inspire other schools to help make their community's a better place. 
There are many ways to learn new things, through experience, being taught, and a multitude of other ways to obtain new information. School is the perfect place to learn new things from teachers that have extensive experience in their specific area of expertise. It is the teacher's and administration's job to help provide a well-rounded education for their students and part of that is assigning work that the students do not want to do. Summer projects are important so the students continue to use their brain and learn how to retain information. 
The electoral college is more organized than a popular vote 
many people get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate 
I also think that it would also be a good idea for the whole school because if a student is to shy to speak up and they dont know how to do something then the teacher can talk to him/her after class. 
and it avoids Run-Off Elections. 
One is "he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime". 
The author describes "Making Mona Lisa Smile" and how a new technology called the Facial Action Cording System enables compures to identify human emotions. Because the author is trying to tell us how the technology can make us feel differents emotions. In this article we can find too many differents emotions that the Mona Lise had. And how the techonology can do it too. 
The reason why we need to start now is because it isn't fair for a group of electors to vote for the president, when the votes of the people are pretty much worthless. 
It says we humans perform this same impressive calculation but why would we need to if we keep trying it maybe someone will get mad and not like it because why would someone want to know what there emotions are. 
This software makes the computer could recognize when a student is bored or confused, then it could modify the lessons, like an human 
Another reason to argue for home-schooling is because of reduced stress. Some may say that the levels of stress will be greatly reduced in the comfort of home without the constant distraction of other students and the demands placed on students by teachers. While this partially might be true, more stress is caused when a student does not know how to manage their time wisely. Home-schooled students are at a greater risk for this because their are also many distractions at home such as cell phones and social media. 
sometimes choices are not enough, and we need to understand the options better. 
I say that because it would be choas if we did not have them keeping the voting in check. 
Consider that state legislatures are techanically responsible for picking electors and that those electors that were voted for couls always defy the will of the people. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. 
Getting more than one opinion can give you more ideas. 
Although it would be interesting to see what the students are feeling during a lesson. 
because the president of the U.S. would be loved and accepted for most of the of the people in United States 
Cell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver's hand. 
The only problem with everything thats going is that being above and studing the planet give you limited insight on the ground to see whats going on. More importantly researchers cannot researchsample of rock, gas or anything else from that distance in the air. NASA is making electronic 
you will always arrive at the best decision if you ask multiple people's opinions. 
In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.     
students won't have to worry about time management, 
The fact that this tecnoligy is avalible to human kind is amizing it can be used in many ways 
some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings. 
they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. 
That way everybody's happy and there will no arguments. 
Some school offer distance learing as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. 
In addition to many down sides of the electoral college voting method, there have been incidents in the past while using this method of voting. 
Scientist are coming up with a solution have them float above the fray and not land. They are coming up with ideas of having a blimp like vehicle just hovering about 30 or more miles above the landscape. They may have a vehicle hovering over Venus so it could avoid the ground conditions for just staying off ground. The surface on Venus is around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure is close to the sea level on Earth which says on paragraph five. 
School is a very chaotic place and students suffer from many things on a day to day basis from bullying, interruptions from staff, teachers, and even other students 
Summer break is a time for relaxation but, sometimes schools may assign students projects over the break. Thoughts of whether projects should be student or teacher designed have been tossed around. Some students of course would choose to do projects of their own choosing. 
, it is important to know that all of these things these countries are doing are for the good of the world. It is good that it is more of a mandatory participation then a optional objective so that people won't take global warming seriously even though it is.    
The majority of students that did not want to provide community service will hate it and some may even hate you. Some students might even leave the school because of that. Some rebellious students might even mess up the work that others have done in the community because they feel they do not have to work. 
Thirdly,NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. 
There are students who may have joined a team and is not good at most subjects. He is not able to get them all done because he may have sports practice during the evening. 
In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home. 
Is Venus a worthy pursuit despite the danger, I say no 
I know for a fact that if I was to get a summer project it would not most likely not get done but if I had a choice to pick it or have my teacher pick it I would pick it my self any day of the week. If I would was to choose my own summer project then I am almost 100% sure most kids would like to pick their own summer project. Just like 2 summers ago I had to go to summer school because I was not doing so good in my cases and the teacher said that all we had to do was a project and we would be all good and we will be ok to go to the next grade so I was relived so I went home and got started on it but when I got started I realized that it was boring and if something was boring I was probaly not going to get it done. 
Most of us, as human beings, need other's help for certain things. Whether that be for school work or friendship advises, we all need someone's help at least once in our lives. When we are uncertain of something, we often times ask for help from the people around us 
The devolpment of driverless cars is a waste of our time and money. Cars will always be somewhat dependent on humans the will never be truly driverless. there will be many liability issuse if an accedent takes place. And what will be the fun in getting your lisence to just sit in a car that drivers itself. I want my children to feel the same way I did when I turned sixteen. I want to be able to give them same gift my dads gave me the gift of reponsbility, trust, and freedom.        
If a teacher saw that, it would be an automatic zero and a call home from their parents. But if the teacher didn't see that, then a kid taking the test might have gotten a higher score then failing the test. 
but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice; instead, it takes it away from them. 
For example, Barack Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compered to 51.3% of the popular vote. The electoral college had the most say and impact upon the outcome of the election 
all these sources have explained that a non motorized vehicle is for the best in our health and in our enviornment. it is a new and innovatied way that is being accepted by a numerous amount of the population.    
I think that if the companies keep working and progressing on the safety issues with the automatic vehicles then maybe these automatic cars can be a good thing. 
In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both the positive and the negative aspects of driverless cars. Therefore, the author never takes a side on the matter. 
Community service helps people, makes you feel better, and is not a humongous time consumer. Anyone who has some extra time should defiantly chose to do some. No one has a busy enough schedule do not be able to participate. As the principal of the school please require students to do community service. 
These cars would drive most of the time, but they would, "notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents". These cars would certainly be helpful, but what would be the point of having a self-driving car if you still have to watch the road as if you were driving yourself? Some manufacturers talk of adding, "in-car entertainment and information systems," but if the driver were focused on these systems, would they be able to react quickly enough if the car approached a dangerous situation? 
My second reason is that students must pay attention to their school work, rather than their friends 
There's tons and tons of water bottles that have been used and not been thrown correctly in the right bin. By recycling , the stuff that are able to recycle can be used over and over again. Trees could be saved by recycling so we don't to kill the animal's home and let them be homeless. 
Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
Adding to that, and perhaps one of the most common arguments against teacher-designed projects, is the statement that students are not exposed to projects that require overarching critical thinking 
So you think that the land formation coincedentally 'a face' created by the weathering. Proves to be a significant amount of source to say there were aliens or a civilation 
the bigger the state the more electoral votes it gets is not for every state should count as a equal amount of votes because its like the little states doesn't get any say in who gets to represent us. "Do you have a older brother or sister? If you do then you know how it feels to get the remote tooking away from you and not get to watch what you want." And that is the same case here. 
Source 2 quoted " Because of the -take- all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example " During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states. 
Although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits 
you get to do fun stuff to like play games and outdoor activites. 
The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in classrooms 
They answer the question of, If it is so dangerous why study more? They found that it could have been another Earth once. I know this because in the text it says, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...The planet suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountins, and craters,"(paragraph 4). This means that by studying it no matter it's condition we can to learn about it and why Venus is in the condition it's in, maybe to even prevent it for Earth. 
Sometimes having to be a scientist is not the best idea. Scientist discover different things at different paces,such as the ones that these scientists discovered on Mars. 
If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try. 
They would go clean parks, help the elder, little kids at schools, soup kitchens for the poor and many more. Its could really make a change to our community. 
For instance if you love the beach, don't you just hate it when you just want to lie on the beach and relax or go surfing but always have to be around great number of sea gulls picking at trashes next to you and being pelted bye plastic bags in the waves? If the children of our generation loves the beach so much, they should just pick up the trash they found-or even threw themselves-then everyone can enjoy a happy and clean ecosystem/community. 
So if you really feel the need of taking down the collage go ahead and do it. It will be better and in the future we can make another one and make it bigger and better then the one we have right know. 
When a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed. To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects. 
Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair. There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done. 
In the article he writes " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, "since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to. 
To start this off it would be a great idea to study venus because it's some much different then earth 
It allows them to take into account their schedule, their own situation. Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended. Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably. Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity. It allows them room to breathe. Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life. 
In the third passage of the artice, the author states, "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles," meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities. 
not driving has many advantages that help you and your city. 
but they have people to do it for them. As long as they cast in the right vote for the party that that candidate represents, then the Electoral college board should be filled with all the right people. 
However, student-designed projects are not always the best reflection of the students and their work ethic. 
Aliens are real, Frank I'm telling you. The aliens made that face on Mars. Why do you think that, Grayson? No one can step on Mars. If a person steps on Mars, they will die. No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die. 
Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. 
People with inexperience and lacking driving skills 
Another external issue that can cause harm or cancel school for students is when schools are under reconstruction which creates distractions and hazardous areas within the school that can threaten the safety of the student body. 
I also would racomened this to the school consulers, only so the consuler can help that person with their emotional prabablem. 
" to repeat that trust is rarely betrayed so that means the Electoral College is something you can count on. " 
In paragraph 5 though, one of the statement claims "not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." Stating that Venus's climate and other factors made being there a pain, but again, it's for sure possible.In paragraph 5 as well it says "(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus." 
The 504 plan is a plan that was made to accommodate and assist students with learning disabilities. This plan works by giving students more time to complete assignments and giving students accommodations to put them in a learning environment that will benefit them 
what i am trying to say is that we need to appreciate technology and true at times people are bad educated but we as a nation can collaborate together so that we could end this, please make the right decision by choosing policy 1. 
In the course of human existance, humanity has always been striving for progress, you might say going the extra mile, in order to better our society. One such great invention was the automobile which allowed us to travel great distances in a short period of time. Consequently, the natural instinct, to grow and improve, has been transfered to the idea of the automobile through the self driving car 
The principal should not force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
The schools should have a Recycling competition where the Study hall class that brings in the most items to be recycled, 
When people vote they are voting for presidents not the electoral college its not right to have a electoral college. Because it should be the peoples choice 
Some counter-arguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. 
In this article they talk about long ago when Venus was covered with forms of life. It says that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans. Venus includes familiar features of valleys, mountains, and craters. NASA is trying to get more humans to study Venus by allowing scientists to float above the fray in a blimp-like vehicle hovering over Venus. It wouldn't be easy for humans but they would survive. 
Online classes would be a great tool and advantage for those who wants to continue their education because it provides scholars not only to be more efficient and organized 
If they spend just as much time studying as they do playing sports, then it wouldn't be a problem, but when they neglect studying just to play sports, then they are harming there future. 
those are the reasons why some cities are making themselves car-free. People are a lot more happy with no cars as said from Elisabeth Rosenthal ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way". And also because people are trying to promote the alternative transportation and reduce smog, thats why Paris "enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" (Duffer, Paragraph 10). 
For example, if you "require" us to do community service even though we don't want to. It's like slavery for us kids. 
This is all the reason why the state senator should choose populae voting over Electoral College voting.     
Students might be more willing and excited to do their summer projects if they create it themselves because it will be something they all enjoy doing. 
My personal opinion is the cell phone issue is blown way out of per portion 
In our school I have sometimes seen problems where kids will steal each others stuff including phones, if the teachers or kids don't know who stole it or can't get it back the I can see many an angered parent suing the district or the school.I know for a fact that I have once suffered as I thought someone had stolen my phone and I wouldn't get it back, I knew that if I would tell a teacher the whole class would be punished until someone came forward and even then my parents would be mad unless that person would get suspended or expelled. 
With all this they want people to identify a students emotion. This is valuable because when a student is doing their work they could get confused. 
I think it's as better idea because the election are more fairy and the president can look how many people vote for him after, why a citizens cannot have plus votes than a Electoral College why? 
Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school, 
Some students like the fast paced lesson plan and will get bored of the change. in some communitys this would not be avaliable due to money problems. 
Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents involving texting and driving. 4,637 people died in the year 2018 because of the accidents. If that does not scare one into not using their phone while driving, then I don't know what will. This is one of the many reasons why I believe driving and the use of a phone should be banned! 
thats not the why it should be in some case we all assunc some time how he person is feelings every are has there won why of showing that emotins in different waya. 
These would be major problems that will occur and it will be delt with of the populariity vote for presideny and how Electoral college should be kept in the United states Goverment.    
In the aritcle "paris bans driving due to fog" it says that Paris had to force people to leave their cars at home or they would have to pay a fine if they drive it. It says that it was intense smog. Cars cause alot of damage to the world but people who drive dont see how it's effecting the world. The Smog caused alot of traffic to happen and that most likely caused car accidents to happen. 
you can see what it is made of, 
they could get more opinions from trusted adults who could have the same similarities. 
Some people however, may believe the students would not complete the projects if it was student-designed. If the students did not know what to choose for their projects they may not even bother to do it. 
The Electoral College process is so much more complicated and long than popular vote, so why do we still use the Electoral College? We shouldn't. 
Imagine you are a scientist at NASA sicussing the face withsomeone who thinks it was created by alliens. 
Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote. If there was a tie in the electoral vote the election would be thrown to the House of Represenstatives. Instead of all that work if there was only a popular vote it would be quick and simple. 
The lava dome takes a form of an isolated mesa which means its the same height as the Face on Mars. 
Phone calls are not the only thing that get you distracted while driving but you got to remember your social medias are blowing up which means you're getting a notification every here and there. 
prevent losing knowledge they have gained while they are on their summer vacation. 
the principals decision on students participating in extra curricular activities would good for me and my peers. It will give students time to develop and grow their skills, like coordination, knowledge of a topic or hobbies. Also it would give students time to socialize, grow social skills and have fun. So in the end the principals decision is great.  
So that is why this iconic face of the 1970's and 80's is just part of the planet mar's itself and wasn't put there by another living speicies on mar's like aliens It's just some shadow's that come together a little bit to give the illusion of eye's, a nose, and a mouth in the region of Cydonia. This face was also discovered in the late 1970's specifically 1976. 
Do you know what is Electoral College? Electoral College is the process of election of the President by a vote in Congress. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Most states have a 'winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. A Certificate of Ascertainment declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent yor state. Smetimes could not be the best choice for our country. 
Some of the most fatal accidents have occured, not because of intoxication, but as a result of texting and driving. 
Then the question comes up about blame in the event of an accident, whose fault is it if a computer is controlling the vehicle? 
I think that they shouldn't change to popular vote in the United States because the electoral college is more fair and plus they don't know the outcome of the election of the popular votes of the prsident of the United States. 
According to defenders of NASA if their was an ancint civilization on Mars NASA would benifit from it financialy. " NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." Also there is no evidence or traces of a Ancient civilization on Mars. 
With more important decisions that go beyond common sense, seeking multiple opinions avoids bias, leads to multiple perspectives, and opens up new possibilities. 
Parents would even like it better because they could get a hold of their children if they needed to instead of having to wait till after school 
they probably think if they liked it change or they don't liked it changed to have least have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think some of the students would liked the change and some of the others students probably like about the change of the policy that might be possible to change. I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she think she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she don't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students wont liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change. I agree with them about it possible about it being changed. 
it also requires a president candidate to have transregional appeal. Always remember "voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.    
First of all, you require that everybody will be graded on how they help their community. Second, you have your students see how bad the community is in some places so that they want to help. Third, you reword them with maybe a dress down day. Fourth you have them do there service to the city during school so that the students don't take up their time to do things that they think are more important. 
I think that the author describes how technolgoy called Facial Action Coding System enables computer to idntify human emotions and expressions of the students in the classroom are valuable. 
It is time for teacher-designed projects, which can be less interesting, stressful for families, and rushed, to be replaced by student-designed projects where students are independantly creative. Although it is good for schools to make sure all their children are not losing skills over the break, the same skills would be practiced if children got more freedom to design their own activity. Plus, summer work would be full of more enjoyment and acedemic value! 
Finally in paragraph 12 garvin states what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West 
The Teacher have there Cell phones out during class sometimes & i think that us students & teachers should be treated the same way. 
A driverless car could possibly stop different aspects of accidents happening. They could even get someone where they need to go. These cars can also help people who barely passed their driver's tests. The car could perform even the most basic stuff, such as, driving through the city, making turns, driving the steering wheel itself, and watching for dangerous things a new or inexperienced driver could not do. Being a new driver can be very challening at first and may even bring a traumatic experience. Coming off as a new driver and only having my license for three months, I know what the pressure can feel like when you feel like you havent learned soemthing and you are already on your own. 
there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree and all are paractical reasons are not liberal or conservative reasons.      
When you are seeking advice you will have a higher chance of finding the correct decision because getting multiple options can make finding the general consensus easier, it can help you in finding poor decisions, and it gives you past decisions to see what happened and what might happen to you 
when there is a car problem such as the engire is failing and the car wont start the car will not be able to tell you what is wrond what you need to do to fix it. 
people want to base their choice on the others opinions instead of just go with the flow. 
furthermore, this may even benefit the teacher by showing that their student has absorbed enough information from the class, that they can detail an entire project about the curriculum without ever receiving any instruction from the teacher. 
The first reason is that it is unfair to voters and presidential nominees. 
There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote. 
We should abolish the electoral college. It nakes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. 
The new programing will be a positive thing, 
Another quote that proves this is a land form is "Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the Face on mars."The photo of mars is a land form because it says right there in the passage it is a lava dome and it is about the same hieght as the face on mars. 
Pedigree is the origin and history of something, when it is good or impressive. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that some of the large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College avoid problems of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes. Sometimes it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a type of candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Some voters in presidential elections are people that want to express a political preference rather then people who's thinking a single vote may decide on an election.         
Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. 
Students sometimes at home need to become the parent for their younger siblings. This carries on the responsibility to feed and watch the child. The student may also need to pick up their younger siblings at the bus stop or daycare, being late to either of those would lead to a bigger problem. Having a parent come home late would push the responsibility to make sure the students sibling is put to bed at the right time. It might take hours for smaller children to sleep, this can badly effect the students sleep. The students responsibilities lead them to have no time for after school activities. 
In this passage "Making Mona Lisa Smile", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. I belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. 
Driverless cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer better transportation than a bus. 
However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects. 
It could be easy conditions to some humnas, but not all. 
The students will be happy because they donÃÂ´t have to go home and be bored. 
The face of mars has become very populer icon it was in hollywood film on books and magazines and also radios and grocery stores. Some people wanted to defenders of Nasabudget wish that a ancient civilzation on mars to destory the faces of mars. Few days later Nasa recived a image for all to see the caption noted a rock formation that resembles the humans head. Nasa wanted to do a surprise amoung missions controllers back at the jet propulsion lab when the face was appered on their jets propulsion lab. When Nasa got the pictures they said that about the same height as the face on mars. Whe they got a rule of tumb you could discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size. 
For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or not enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade. 
I know us children tend to be lazy at times, but we should be more active in community service and these are the reasons why. 
it allows the students to do projects they are interested in 
I am writing to you about the debate on the abolishment of the Electoral College 
I personally don't like the summer assignments teachers give us because they require the whole summer to do. Kids like me want to have fun, not stay at home and read a book all day. 
Also, althoughs theres a lot of cons to this, 
You can also help people because the war put them to rounes and the animals will help them live. Also saves people from dieing and starving. You need to be strong and kind and helpful. 
In defense of the Electoral College , it can be a faster way to elect a new president 
Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. 
for example "each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated " back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems. 
People ask for more than 1 person for advice because they will get different ansers every time.i think its good to ask for advice when you need it.                                                                                                                                                   
The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, "Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average..." There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed. 
Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home. In my opinion there will be some students that will take this serious and do the right thing.                                                                                                                                                           
last,popular votes/majority rule are in all a better way of voteing in the U.S because of the fairness and rights the U.S citizens all deserve,yes the Electoral College votes are easier but in the end who really wins? noboby does 
A new system of election must be created to make up for the pitfalls that are inevitable in the Electoral College. A country that is supposed to be a democracy does not have the voting system that such a proud democracy deserves. 
First of all, we're just sitting down mostly our days watching TV and computer games. This would actually help us get to know more people, and be more social. Also, depending on what we're volunteering for, also a good work-out. 
The last example is if schools had to shut down due to weather or other issues. 
Would it really be worth seeing Venus because it had a lot of danger. 
Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.(Source 2 Paragraph 9)Even the voters would perfer majority rule 
if the hardware in the car was to malfunction. 
but this is still not a reason to stop the development of new technology. 
We are a country that has been falsely relying on the people and lying to their faces about it 
By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that "Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party." I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where. 
Some of the smaller states don't get to see any campaign ads like the larger states do so they are basically putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters. 
Being social teaches you great life skills for the future. You can't avoid not talking to people the rest of your life because you have to eventually get somewhere financially or even physically. Last but not least, I think social skills are the most important things you have to learn if you want to do an after school club, because you cannot enjoy it if you don't talk to anyone. 
I think that Electoral College is not the way to vote in the future 
Most people would like it for extra credit for certain classes. 
In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President? 
COMPROMISEis the big word of the day. Most compromises are the right way to go in many occasions. also, it says that it was in THE CONSTITUTION 
adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. 
On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day had come and it was time to take a picture of the Face. The photo was taken with maximum resolution, and when people saw the picture there was no mistaking it for a landform on Mars. 
By having distance learning as an option, many disabled and mentally ill students would be more comfortable.  
Not having phones at all in school wouldn't be to good. Some people might have something important to tell there parents. 
As you know every four years a president is elected. In order for that to happen the candidates go through the process of an Electoral College or the people vote. An Electoral College is when the congress gets to vote to pick who the president and vice president will be. And the other way is when the people of that state get to vote. 
I hope that you will keep cell phones from use in school. I know that students will be mad at first but they will see when you let them bring there phones how unfocused it is during school. Kids have a lot of things going on in there life and when they have a cell phone i bet they talk about how they feel to there friends. Also it is a off task thing because of un answer questions they might have from a friend or some one. So please hear me out and do not let students use cell phones at all in school.      
Technology, in some areas, does not work every day and sometimes cannot be used at all.At Generic_School, there are countless days when the the internet is completely down and no electronic devices can be used.Teachers who have planned to use technology for their lesson have to come up with something different to do, with no preparation time, which leads to misusing class time at the fault of the technology errors.If a teacher assigns work over a weekend, while the school can provide a laptop, they cannot provide wifi and internet connection in the homes of their students.Many students do not have the funds to pay for wifi and are not able to drive to a library to connect to the internet.Even if a student has technology, there is always a large chance their technology might not work.This is not the fault of the student and they should not be penalized for it.Technology caused student to be more stressed and worried bout whether or not their assignment will upload on time, or if a lesson will load and play, and it is not necessary.Technology is not practical or easily accessible for many students. 
If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind. 
a lot of families have no money! 
For example, say you need advice on whether or not to get a dog or a cat as a pet. What would happen if you did seek advice? What would happen if you didn't? What kind of opinions would you become aware of?You are unsure whether a dog or cat is a right pet for you. You decide to ask the advice from multiple others by different sources. One person you ask is completely against dogs; this person is being biased as they are telling you how they believe cats are better than dogs, only because they have one. They list the negative qualities of dogs, and list the positive qualities of cats, something you consider.The same thing in the above paragraph happens with a dog lover, who advises you get a dog, which in their opinion, is better than a cat. This person has a dog, and is being biased aswell. This enables you to get different opinions on your question by seeing both sides of the story. The dog lover, like the cat lover, now tells you the negative qualities of cats, then the positive qualities of dogs. You can now make a better choice on which pet to get that suits you.Now, say you didn't ask for any other opinion and decide to get a dog. Since you didn't seek out others advice, you find that this dog needs too much exercise, is always hungry, and doesn't leave you alone. You are unhappy with your choice since you didn't seek out all the possible information from others. 
In the artical its says " Perhaps Dr. Huangs's emotion algorithms are different sort of " Da Vinci Code" which mean that they probable have not figured it out yet which can lead to having wrong answers. 
Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and so many more people think that we should abolish the Electoral College. 
When election day comes and you finally drop your vote in the ballet box after waiting in line for the past hour, you walk away knowing that you have helped the candidate of your choice to rise to the top of the voting pole. Oh how wrong you are. The United States works on a voting system called the Electoral College. "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." 
Many people would say that it is as if they don't have right that it's unfair that someone is picking their future 
You can easily have had you vote given to someone and they could have had cheated you out . 
Direct voting instead of using the outdated, unfair Electoral College voting would be a great update to the United States. Beniffiting the voters, electors, and the elected.      
and you want a happy community don't you? 
This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote. 
Smalls states aren't widely noticed by the president because they feel like they should concentrated in the big states because of there electoral votes. Still, small states tend to make it easier for them because they look at if the state was either Republican or Democrac during the past years and they take note of that. They know they'll win in those states, even though they are small numbers, every inch of it counts to help them win the title of President. 
I think this is a fantastic way 
I as a student here at your school do not think students should be forced to do community service 
there is travelling if you work. 
Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. 
Moreover, you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. 
First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emmissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many enviornments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanantly cripple our planet 
They can be proven even safer to both pedestrians and policeman alike, by being utilized by people under the influence of alcohol, to drive home safley, and not harm any people utilizing the sidewalk or other drivers. 
It was just a landform that was formed on Mars. 
You meet new people,not only in the beginning but also at the very end. You form relationships with others and get to make so many memories. I met my best friend in first grade and she is still my best friend. Her name is Generic_Name. She has introduced me to so many other people and has got me out of my comfort zone. My favorite part about the friendship is the memories we have made, the trust we gained, and the respect we have for each other. She has made me a better person and has opened up my eyes to be able to accept others no matter what they look like or how they feel on the inside. 
Lastly, my final reason is how hard it will be to access this tech. 
Because of the winner-take-all system 
And thirdThey would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. 
Taking a student out of sports and other activities will not promise higher grades. 
With the electoral collage, you are to have state representatives. Your state is to take a majority vote and relay that information to the state representatives. Then the state representatives will then vote according to how the majority persuaded them to vote. 
The artical saids" Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 9).Therefore it explains that the computor can be a reowned drama coach because the computor is carfully produce of the emotions on stage. 
Recently, students haven't felt safe in their schools. During a crisis, students could have classes online to keep students feeling safe. 
In the conclusion part it talks about how you are suppose to smile. And putting on happy face works. If you make a happy face you are showing your emotions to other people. I think that a lot people should put on there happy face. Becuase they will be showing there emotions to people. I think that some people don't want to smile becuase they don't like to smile. Or they hate to smile in front of people. I wonder why some people don't want to smile. I think that some people don't want to smile in front people. Becuasue they are afraid to smile in front of people. 
The smart car is a great idea by google but personally I feel that they should just keep that idea to themself 
We could see what Venus has that could benefit ot affect Earth. 
For example, " I facetime my best friend and my cousin and say, " I need help with finding something to wear to school tomorrow." My cousin says I should wear a skirt because it's cute and very trendy, but my best friend said I should wear my new overalls because, it's cold outside and and they could be the new 2020 trend.I took my time to compare the outcome and then i made my decision. " When you want two different things you can ask others to help make the decision. 
Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. 
The number of deaths increase everyday do to drinking and driving as well. There is a specific time you can drive after drinking which is 5 hours to sure you're ok to drive without causing a crash. Which makes thousands of people dangerous drivers everyday fights the public!!! 
A student may be traveling during this time, and it may not be up to them whether they want to travel or not as their parents could force them to come along to travel with them. Or, it could be that they have to go out of town for a while due to a family emergency. The student has no control over this and therefore cannot attending the class; however, if they could access an online resource and schedule a video conference with the teacher when they are in class teaching, the student won't miss any important material and still not be in the room as well. 
Wyoming only has 1 representative who represents 500,000 voters compared to California's whopping 35 million voters and 55 representatives.Some of these smaller states are not getting their fair vote because their states population. Florida, New York, Texas and California have over 20 representatives to represent each state; how is that fair to the neighbor states with 2-3 representatives? 
They would be expensive to buy, but would pay off themselves every time an incident is avoided.Not to mention, eventually the regular cars would be phased out.This means that car companies who build and sell the driverless cars would be making a sensational amount of money.Finding the equptment to build all the driverless cars would be expensive and time consuming, but the process would be worth it to have all the new cars made and on the roads. 
Not only can online school benefit people with hypothyroidism but also people struggling with ADHD. ADHD can effect someones ability to focus in a classroom setting. A student may get distracted and miss the directions a teacher is giving. A student may also end up missing important announcements. People with ADHD struggle to stay silent and sit still for long periods of time. They need some form of an outlet to let the energy they build up out. 
beleve or not belive e- some people tend to base things on opinions instead of real facts like how people might say ' well how can you be so sure that aliens didn't make the face ' my rebundal would be 'the image first apperared on jpl website revealing 
seeking multiple opinions may open up new possibilities that should be considered when making a decision 
Luke is likes the program good all its good things. So i whould go and other people shuld to. 
Don't you think that it is great to live in a free county where the citizens make the rules, and what is in the best interest of the people is what is taken into consideration more than what the government wants? 
For example in paragraph eight it states "Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but humans curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevors". 
My opinion is that we should study venus. 
I would rather drive my car than let a computer beacuse technology will always have problems and errors 
The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim. 
It is a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and a polular vote of qualified citizens for the president, as stated in line 1. 
However, the students' overall concensus as to what the work load is would be more congruent with how future classes would perceive it. 
student doesn't like to school because student are lazy. 
The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is important. Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments. In conclusion, Venus would be just another planet like Earth. 
Now the reason I say people should have their phones is in case of emergency like if they get in a car crash or if they have to call 911 to help someone. 
by taking these courses, students will display an increase in independence and autonomy that they would not necessarily experience in a traditional setting. 
The electoral college method is a process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and the Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This means that that people are not directly voting for who they want to be president but voting for an elector that then places a vote. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.But the other process of voting for a president is what we have now, it is called the popular vote, in which people go to a place where there are machines that you can place your vote for the president you want elected, the person with the most votes becomes the president of the United States and the person that lost the popular vote is elected vice president. 
Our spending habits these presidents we have had over the past years have lead us into doing? Im surprised were all still alive honestly. Different candidates have different ways of planning their lives in office, their daily commutes, their daily functions, what laws they are going to put into place next, the next time that they will make a public apperence, those kind of things. But when theyre talking about taking electoral college out of play because its "outdated" personally I would say throw them a box of loony toon cereal. 
People can see that its up to us to choose who is president, but its not the members of the Electoral College job to add more credit to the person losing or winning 
I disagree with the fact of having a Electoral College. I don't think it would help with the elections. I think it should go the most popular votes. 
They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too. 
I do see the reasoning in having an electoral college so that way we are less likely to end up with a tie or any other mishaps 
Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. 
Millions of students from various cultures and locations have a common distaste for school. Many of them confidently argue that learning from home would be much more comfortable and conducive to their learning, for they would not be limited by the pressures of an academic atmosphere, which include intimidating teachers, competitive classmates, and uncomfortable classrooms. 
If we did do community service more people would come to this town and that means more students and more money for the school! 
The new technology would be able to tell if a student was bored, or if they got confused. Then the computer could modify the lesson for the student to help them learn better. The technology could act like an effective human instructor. Must human communication is nonverbal. Emotional communication is also nonverbal. The studesnts could improve with one on one lesson plans. The studensts could also work at their own pace and have their own personal plans. 
Most of the time te popularity vote is changed by the Electoral College, They chose what they think is so called "right". The Electoral College has a mind of its own 
When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, I took many trips. I went to New Orleans, Greece, China, and many more places. 
If students do not already have a B average then how can they keep up their grades when they are participating in activities? Students need to learn to organize their time between activities and schoolwork. So not only will they learn to organize their time better but they would also be getting better grades. 
the pollution it causes to the environment 
There are some students that even though they try their hardest, they will not be able to get the B average because of their inability to work at a high level. 
we have some reasons to take classes in online because we missing to much classes for us graduation 
All over the world, attending a school is a vital part of a person's schedule. The person could be a graduate student, under-graduate, or a high school student, but on all levels, it is so essential that daily activities are centered around it. With something as big as this there are bound to be people that, for some reason, are unable to attend school and with that comes obvious disparities in privileges given to certain people 
"Winner Take All" sound familiar to you. Maybe not but I am going to explain it anyway. The Winner Takes All System awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. Except for the unlucky ones like Maine, and Nebraska they have something called the "Proportional Representation". All said and done the "certificate of Ascertainment" is introduced after the elction has partaken in. This lists all of the canidates who ran for President in your state choosen along with the names of there "side kick" the electors. This shows who will be in your country running for president and elector for the next 4 years until the next election. 
For example, say if there are driverless cars in the future, and you or a group of friends are going on a road trip. The car is on auto pilot and you are drinking or texting, reading, listening to music, and/or perhaps sleeping. The car may not signal or warn you that their is traffic, or on road construction uphead. The car may cause you to get in trouble for not paying attention and taking control when neccassary, and/or may cause a horrbile accident. This can and will cause conflict between you and the manufacturer. This can cause a huge debate on driverless cars ; are they dependent and reliable enough or are self service cars safer?. 
Sports are a very important factor to many schools.Many kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.Our Principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. 
The Electoral College is a process where selected elector come together and vote for President and Vice President. It consist of 538 electors and majority vote (270) is required to elect the presient 
theres rumors there she/he did that, drama,she/he is ugly or they're poor. Teenagers make it so hard to make friends cause if you hang out with a certain person it makes you just like them. Some teens are so opinionated to the point it starts to count as harassment or bullying. Also if your trying to make some more friends and depending on who your friend is they might not like the fact you want to make new friends so you ask around people that you know for their opinion what should you do if you should befriend the person or stay friends with them. 
striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation. 
you can't get close to venus because it's too dangerus. 
If the students have less experience then when they go to collage and join a sport they won't have a clue on how to play. If they don't know how to play then they won't make the team. If they don't make the team then they would be upset and could blame it on the school they went to. If they do that it would make the school look bad. Also the more experience that we have the better we will learn. If students could only have C and up to play they will have a better chance of getting into a good collage and joining a sport and getting to be on the team. Also it wouldn't be fair to the students to not be able to play sports and get a good scholarship to a sports collage and learn even more about the sport then they did when they where in school. 
Without a doubt, it is a necessity for any student to have the skills of efficiency and organization through a means of completing the assignments and work provided to them, for it is what will help them in the near future. 
Germany is one of the greatest countries that is against low car life. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. 57 percent sold a car to move Germany. (Source 1). In total their is approximatly 5,500 residents and has a low car life because their are less space for parking. 
students' lack of motivation, 
Then, Venus is known to be Earth's sister planet! 
You can make friends on the way like Luke did because after you give the animals to the people who need help there is room for things like Volleyball, Baseball, Table-tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling. These are all good things to pass the time after some hard work has been done. 
In source two it says "over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now". 
One is because the kids might not want you to know how they feel. My second one is becuase what if a kid gets picked to be mad or sad and he gets into a fit and he gets super ticked off becuase he didn't want anyone to know. The last one is becuase that weird to be checking for the kids emotions. The first two are both similar and the third one is just plain obvious. 
But, it still might not be natural 
They are called disaster factor 
In conclusion studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because if you just reread everything in this passage it's basically telling you alot of information about venus. If you look back in the passage in read paragraph 8 it's giving you information about venus it says that venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The last in final thing is that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So that basically tells you everything about why studying is a worthy pursuit despite for venus. 
Most can agree with the Mobile World Congress in the executive chairman, Bill Ford. His proper approach is to plan a business plan for a world that consider personal vehicle ownership is undesirable so they can put down emissions so it can improve safety. 
Finally we see that the self driving car may actually be safer that regular drivers. 
This artical,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is the authors way to give ideas on how to help get closer to Venus 
I would think more than emotional computers, thinking more advanced or just regular old computers thats what i would do if i were creating computers. 
and some of them doesn't want to have problems. 
In this story the author is talking about how humas have not made it on the planet of Venis. At least that we know about 
But with this system it can cause problems with bugs, viruses, and etc. 
I urge you to please consider your peoples feelings on this matter and consider not abolishing the electoral college. 
The author presents this idea as the main idea of the passage because Venus is sometimes called the evening star. This point is the one of the brightest in the night sky this makes even easy to spot for amateur stargazers to spot. This statement is misleading because it is actually a part of our solar system second planet from our sun. This star is great from a distance but it is a very meaningful cloud draped world. This planet may be bright we have sent many human organized spacecrafts never survived more than a few hours. 
For example, when my sister was in tenth grade she did not do her summer project because the teacher did not explain it well and she didn't understand how to do it. This shows that if summer projects were student designed, students would have a better understanding on how to do the project. 
That should make the situation easier to handle, because you can see how it might end if you choose a certain way to deal with it. Someone you ask for advice from might have been in the same situation you are in, and can help you handle it. But you won't know if they have been in the same situation if you don't ask multiple people. 
This machine created by Dr. Huang and his colleague prof. Nicu Sebe can impact students in ways that are good or bad. For some people it can be a good thing but for others it can mean a bad thing. 
The electoral college is not a place to be harmeed its a process. Therer a amendment of the the electrol college and it is amendment 23rd. 
In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win.  Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far 
I think for people who actually participate and really help out with the community service, they should get a little reward. 
So there is only one way that the electoral colledge is helpful and it is not even to the American voters. This is why we need a change and to get rid of the electoral colledge. 
My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes 
My fellow co-workers and I thought this was incredible. We had just found something that could have proven ancient life on Mars. It turned out that it wasn't. Later, we figured out that it was another regular Martian mesa 
If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet. 
Can you tell if someone is happy or sad? 
this is why i think we should not have the electoral college becuase it causes to much cauase throught all the steps you have to go through it takes so much time up and there is so many other thing we can be focusing on i think the electral college needs to be gone and over with and we need to find other ways to vote for the presidant and the vice presidant 
If you think it is where is the evadence like houses 
have all of your students do at least 15 minutes of community service a week. 
"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform." 
People old and young have a thirst for knowledge students especially. Teachers may give students a project they know nothing about but the goal is for the student to keep learning while on break 
some people may continue to insist that teacher-designed projects lead to better scores because students can receive easily help due to the criteria made specifically for the project 
Having an extracurricular activity means having a extra thing to do in school that you like that will provide for the school; like for an example: being the school announcer in the morning it's something that you like that will provide for the school and it is why students should have an extracurricular activity. 
As a young mind in a world diverse opinions and perspectives, I have seen that the generation I live in has become a "me" generation. In other words, this generation of students has become so selfish and absorbed in their own personal needs, they've forgotten that there are other people in this world who have greater issues that they must face. For example, when students are requested to give money for a charitable cause, such as helping the less fortunate in third world countries, they choose not to. The sad part is that this refusal to help others in need is not because they are uninformed, but because they are so caught in themselves that they are too selfish to even provide for someone other than themselves. As a matter of fact, 87% of students in middle school stated that if they ever had the chance to give back to their community in a simple way, they would not. 
Scientist say that venus could have been covered in with largely oceans and had life forms on its planet similar to earth 
The third reason is less time at home, 
Each Candidate running for President in each state has his or her own group of electors. Each party (democratic or republican) selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. 
But no matter how many sensors, lasers, or recievers you have on this driverless car, artificial intelligence will never be as smart as human intelligence. 
they will always be learning. 
if you have to walk home with your siblings. 
I have couple reasons why I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral. 
The Electoral College assures that the President isnt just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country.  Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States. 
These driverless claim to use less gas than any other car which would make it more flexible. Without using gas these cars would most likely be using electricity which does lower the pollution levels, this is a positive change. 
Students may view school as an obligation, wishing that they could just stay home all day and relax. At first, the introduction of allowing students to learn through a computer screen in the comfort of their own home may seem like an excellent idea, however, after a while students may begin to feel lonely and as if they are not benefiting much from it. 
The Author Also says that since venus is very dangerous 
you cant communicate with people and you are not disrupting anyone by talking, and some people do things better while listening to music like it helps a lot when your running because it keeps you mind off it but it will make you work harder on a test. Or i know that it will help me atleast 
This however is not the case. Many students in the classroom, have stated that they wish that they could do more at home, so that if they miss school, they aren't rushing to get back on top 
I think people shouldn't be able to use their phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle. 
In conclusion, distance learning has a lot of benefits and brings forth solutions to modern problems. Students taking distance learning can better understand technology and how they feel about it. It would come to no surprise if we saw an increase of teachers and computer scientists due to the implementation of this program. School offices would be thrilled to use less money on transportation, and to see students enjoy their success without the turmoil of going through unwanted social interaction. Distance learning is an example of how technological evolution brings forth great changes to everyday life, and how we can get into a healthier mindset of change in the school system. 
In conclusion I do think attending classes from home can benefit a student. For the same reason as students learning better in the comfort of their homes, having no distractions, and the fact that it can help a student with social differences. I believe attending classes from home can help in many different ways such as the ones that I included in my statement today. Thanks for reading and hearing my position on this issue. 
Also risk not only themselves but other people.It is just not right and not fair for other people they could have potentially hurt or damage their possessions. 
Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens? 
But some poeple say that the Electoral College is there to help us and to help most states have the winner take all system. 
it will be easier for most kids in this school 
Another reason for online schooling being beneficial for students is that it keeps the student safer. 
Pardon me, but i would like to disagree with you. What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural land form. 
I strongly believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State. 
Secondly, shadows We all knows that shadows can be very deceiving just like in this instance 
Lastly, students will actually enjoy working on their summer projects! 
We all the people should just say that Monday,Tuesday,Wensday we all should drive to school,work or where ever and Thursday,Friday,Saturday they should walk to work or take the bus. 
Learning from home can solve all these problems and more. 
it gives a chance for kids to think on their own. 
Well yeah it might help them pass there classes but still. 
New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning. 
I would like to put my opinion about students being required to perform community service. 
so the answer to that question would be yes it does work because it gives the people a right to choose who they want and the president doesn't get to much power and without this system we wouldn't have any presidents you know what i mean. 
I would understand why somone would belive it was not a natural landform. one reson they may not is in the text it stats it was winter in april 98 it was clooudy time of year on the red planit. In the text it also stats that some pepoul belived aliens marking where hidden by haze. 
So if a student was to design a project it would be based on their personal preference and not about everyone. Concluding, that summer projects should not be designed by students because they can be bias. 
Last but not least, we should keep Electoral College because this allows for each candidate to pick his or her own groups of electors. 
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" thinks that exploring Venus is worth the risks that are required. 
It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. 
The reason some people might not think it's a good idea for students to have to participate in one school activity is some students might be stressed if their forced to do an activity they don't want to do, the reason being is, some people have social anxiety this means when put around people they tend to get uncomfortable, nervous, and maybe even cry because they have no clue what to say. 
Which mean the kids would have to walk everywhere they go, also the parents when you have jobs..what if you dont get to work on time? 
and to give sick students the experience of attending school, as it is every person's given right to receive an education and nothing should prevent that in the modern world. 
Students will pay attention and the teachers will tell that student what day they will have a test. Students will get notified by their teachers when they have work to turn in. Students can't lie and say they didn't have homework because the teacher notified them when the homework was due. 
For example if we could have our cell phones out nobody would be thinking of the lesson or would even bother to tune into the class because obviously a phone is a perfect way to chat with your friends while the teacher isn't looking. This makes it difficult for the person sending the messages AND the one receiving them because both are having their attention pulled away from what's important (class) and what's not (socializing). Another example is even if the rule says that cell phones can only be used during free time students will be using them all the time ignoring the rule. Honestly anybody can quickly put the phone under the table and text a quick message to their friend but in that short second the teacher could've been explaining something crucial to the development of the students skills. And just missing that one little thought the student is now behind because of it. As you can see cell phones will be a major disruption to the students if allowed for them to have them in school. 
So i believe that people shoudl be able to have there phones people just need to be more respinsible of how they use them.   
If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election. 
I think the only time a student should be forced to do community service is when their being punished. 
it is a vote qualified by the citizen and the founding fathers established it in the constitution. all of the votes have to go to the electors and to the congress and then they pick the president and the vice president. the election is held every four years on the same month and day. the governor lists all of the people who ran for presidentin your state.the winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canididate. the governor prepares a cerificate of ascertainment. the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidatein your state and shows which electors are representing your state. the 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. 
If the project were to be teacher based, most students wouldn't be intrested in it, therefore, some students wouldn't want to do the project and will have the lack of wanting to learn about something that doesn't intrest them and make it a chore. Making a student choose a topic for their project would, make them choose something they're intrested in and they will most likely have a project ready to turn in at the end of summer. Student would also complete the project with more detail instead of not having any at all. All the projects would be different subject and more unique letting students choose so teachers can make sure students learned. 
a plethora of different experiences to go off of. 
A person with the grade C average will put pressure on them and they may fail because they're not putting much effort just for sports. Grade C average is good but still, the person can just think of sports and not care about grades because it's in the requirements. A person with a B average can definitely do the job because they have good grades and they can do well in school AND in sports. 
Cellphones and driving have been a main cause for deaths over the years. 
So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. 
I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College. 
In the world today, we try to conserve our resources as much as possible. Fuel is a major resource that is used to power a lot of things in everyday life 
but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before? 
''So there, I proved to you that the face on mars was just a mesa.'' ''I don't care what you say im sticking to my opinion.'' ''Okay what ever, I know i'm right and you're wrong.''

but this oportunities some times have a problems 
NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus. 
Everyday I wake up and catch the bus at 6:50 in the morning, and I don't get home until 5:45 at night. That's nearly twelve hours of being on the bus and being at school when I could be doing something more productive like cleaning my room, sleeping, or studying for a test. As much as I don't like school, taking it online would hardly be helpful. 
In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, "Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote." This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote. 
While ignorance is bliss and most drivers highly doubt the possibility of an accident because of using a phone while driving, there is still a 400% chance of crashes occurring due to being distracted. Laws being passed to establish security among citizens are in vain due to the ignorance of people that do not care about the risks. They do not only put themselves in danger, but the driver is also responsible for the passengers, pedestrians, and the other people on the road. 
Most people who are getting in trouble are using cell phones, and breaking the school rules. When i first got my phone taken up, i was VERY upset. I thought they couldn't take your cell phone cause they didn't buy them?But i was wrong, and i figured out they could, because it's the county rules, not JUST your school. 
the way i see it we need to have something to do with our lives and how we spend it on campus even off campus we have to behave when we are around teachers. plus i think those 4 letter words every day is driving the students crazy, I'm sorry but I'm telling the truth. But if you don't want to hear it then that's ok with me and that walking on the green going to connections please give us a break that's why boys cut up all the time because you always say walk on the green it is making us cut up like that since Elementary school we didn't have to walk on the green but now we are in middle school we have to walk on the green, i mean come on TEACHER_NAME can you just at least give this school a break and don't you get me started on boys not pulling up there pants, as RELATIVE_NAME says on RELATIVE_NAME's big happy family pants on the ground got your pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground can't turn around with the gold in your mouth RELATIVE_NAME remix what. But she is right boys do look like fools with there pants on the ground, they got that style from jail they need to leave that style where its at and start handling there business and have s future from STUDENT_NAME 
five reasons to keep our method of choosing the president 
This technology is very valuable for the classroom. 
not having a social life can be hard and sometimes depressing. 
So because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes. 
In 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author gives suggestions as to why studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the little details as to how Venus carries a great amount as to how scientists can study to bring actual life to that planet. However, along it comes some safety hazards like extreme temperatures and high gasses in the atmosphere. I can see as to why might Venus be so similar to Earth. Venus is "often referred to as Earth's "twin" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." If having a planet that similar to a living planet why wouldn't we do everything in our power to make a planet that is very much the same as ours. Science has been evolving a lot over the years and I'm pretty sure that with all the technology and theories scientist have came up with them being able to have a study to plan out how to bring life to Venus would probably work at and greater and more things coulud also come along with it. 
The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus.

Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that live in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves. 
Planet has a rocky surface almost as a valley and mountains , craters. National Aeronautics has one particular reason sendind humans to allow them to float above the fray.

There was no alien monument after all. The pictures actually show a butte or a mesa landforms comman aroiund the American West. These are natural landforms becuase scientitst say that there is no life on Mars. NASA took pictures in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. 
The electoral college has robbed prsidental canidates like (Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob dole, & Al Gore) of their chance of becoming president, even after they won the popular vote, 
When I asked my mom for help, she looked at me with a confused face and paused for a long time. I think it was because she never thought of me asking that question before. As a result, she couldn't think of an answer on the spot. She still gave me good advice, but it did seem as if she had trouble answering me. If you ever have someone who can't give you an answer easily, the best choice is to ask someone else. They may have the abilities to give you a well thought out answer. Lastly, another person may have more knowledge about the subject, so they may be able to help you more efficiently. 
Swing states are often paid more attention and given more information than regular states. While being paid more attention, the swing states together are able to determine the election's outcome. Though small states don't get much attention, they still have a say in the election.    
it is what has picked our leaders and until now I believe it has been very effective 
It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. In Electoral College the electors are the one who elect the president not the people and my opinion is that its a good idea because not everyone has the same opinion. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 
Creating a way for students to attend classes from home is a very practical and useful innovation, and through it, many students will receive education that they might not otherwise get. 
it will allow students who are often absent to miss less of the curriculum and allow for easier catch up if work is missed 
The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, "When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government." After viewing the articles Source 1:"What Is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer, and  Source 3:"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter. 
Another thing the Facial Action Coding System could really help with an issue like suicide 
In " The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe 
So, these three reasons are because you either need answers, wise, or more advice. Every reason this stuff happens is because people just simply need advice. Other ideas are good ways to see who has the right advice. These are three of thousands of reasons, but these are a few of the reasons this happens. 
During the school year, students go from class to class completing the required work to excel. In most cases, this requires sitting through a lecture followed by an activity and homework. All of which are teacher-designed. For this reason, summer projects should be student-designed. 
You will have a lot of information and reasonings on why it's that planet or why is it close to the sun. The text gives you a lot of information about venus and why it is called that. As it states "long ago when venus was covered with nothing but the ocean", they could of had human life on that planet. You can study venus and maybe found out if there was any human life their besides the oceans that were their. You can be the one who goes to space and can take a look at venus and if it's safe you can probably visit the planet 
If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.  Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us. 
it proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. But in my own words i think it is a good idea for humans shoukld study venus because it gives you fun facts about it 
This computer than could tell you how Mona Lisa was feeling is a 3-D constructer computer. In oreder for it to detect a painting,Picture, or even an actual person's face Right now it has to have all 44 muscle movements of a human. the only thing i'd change about this experiment is instead of making everything nowadays computerized and robotic why dont we do this with paper and pencil, collect data and figure it out,if it doesn't work on the first try then change your hypothnose and do the experiment all over again. 
If the students cant use their phones, then the teachers and the principle should not be allowed to use their phone either. 
One benefit of asking multiple people what their opinion is on an issue is that they can help you be sure of something. 
Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. 
After the realization of how dangerous the operation of a cellular device is while driving, more states started to amend laws against the action. 
I think it's crazy that Paris has banned driving due to smog 
Electoral College is the way that  the gov't wants it to happend. Voters dont vote for the president no  ore that for for the people that vote for the president. The american voise is not being heard. 
And would convince other people to stop or text them before they drive to say that they are not going to be responding while they drive. 
becuase in distance venus is the closest planet to us in denstity and size so pretty much Venus is a mini Earth. 
Cell phones draw students' attention by a notification, phone call, or just being on a desk. Food being handed out in class creates a ruckess by everybody wanting a snack to chew. Wrappers of candy, bags of chips, and sodas being opened creates a noise that is tempting. When a student misbehaves, teachers have the ability to write them up and let upper athorities take action. Distractions cut into the time a student has to complete any assignemnt. 
When you're a teenager you want to be free as possible but sometimes you are too free, that you don't know what to do with this much freedom so you do nothing. 
I believe that the face n mars was not created by aliens. 
getting advice from more than one person has its rewards. My reasoning is because you have more options to choose from, one person may trouble answering your question, and another person may have more knowledge about your question. Ask someone who has more experience with what you want to know. Also, go to someone you trust, and someone who will give you factual information. "The right people will be with you to help you answer all of your questions." ~Unknown 
The Electoral College is also a mordern sense. Also no region (south,northeast,etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Residents also feel that their votes dont get counted that the new president will have no regard for thier interest, that he really isnt their president. 
that is why you should go and do that program 
could make America on top because of our technoglicial advances: such as a driverless car. 
Luke' point of view of convincing others to participate in seagoings cowboys program . 
However this is true but let me tell you why this isnt the case for all students. 
You can probably see the world in this nasty or horrific way, but there can be someone right in front of you who loves the world, and they know it has problems, but they look on the positive side. The three main reasons I look for advice is because there are three things I want to be able to get from what was given to me. 
Students in America struggle throughout their life attending school while accepting the burden of friendships, family and other stresses and anxieties. Summer becomes that safe haven for them, to completely decompress from their issues and take a break from the mental strain of schools, with all the tests, exams and projects that're encompassed within it. Students who are allowed the opportunity to design their own project become eager to create a product which displays their learning over the summer. Once in my freshman year, I was given an option to complete a teacher-assigned book report, or to construct an independent book report. Being allowed this opportunity made me eager to chose a book that satisfied my interests, and not be punished to endure reading a four hundred page book about trivial history. This point illustrates the impact that student-designed summer projects can instill, without the students feeling punished by the school. Learning should be a process of critical thinking and analysis, however when this process is interrupted by an external predetermined body it is detrimental to one's education. 
What do you like to do after school? The answer is probably go home and relax. But wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity 
If this is allowed the this will probably happen, the students will not pay attention, they will not learn, won't get their homework finished, they might get held back a grade, not graduate, not go to college, won't get a very good job (that they actually like to do), from then on their are a few more problems and all because the school allowed cell phones in class 
creativity of the project completion. 
This is crutial because "a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president" (Posner).  With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them 
the style of today's stress-inducing form of schooling. 
Even though if the electoral college system is such a good system then why was there such confusion in th200 fiasco. That makes the electoral college system look very bad becuase it can keep it's voting in balance at all. 
What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters. 
this method also cant get any more fair because the people vote who they want and whoever has more votes then they win. whats not fair about that? 
most of the students already do an out of school activity 
The article states that "Conspiracy theorists say that the Face is evidence that NASA would rather hide." 
Secondly, in favor of many parents and guardians, home is not only more comfortable for students, it is also much safer. 
the students should create a project 
Like we said during this speech we said that "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform." Later on we did it again in the speech "Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view," Said Garving. "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real. 
The technology that is being deveolped is valuable 
I think that we should change the electoral collage because is it not very organize 
Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea 
Driverless cars should not be the next invention. 
I do not think humans will have very much control over the car and if it ever malfunctioned and a human needed to steer and it never says it needs assistence then what? 
Building a driverles car is going to be very expensive. 
The blimp-like vehicle can be used as a research area as well as a living area for the astronots. It can go higher in the air meaning it can avoid the storm, earthquakes, and erupting volcanoes. NASA has not found a way to use the vehicle to help reasearchers get samples from Venus. Scine they are in the air above the gas clouds it would be hard for researchers to get photography or videography of Venus surface. 
The people should also get the vote because wouldn't it make sense if the people did get who they voted for anyways? 
Everyone would be able to get to where they want to go without waiting in a long line on the highway for hours. And if its a smart cars driving people would get lost and stranded places as much. Having a driverless car could be more efficent for older people too. They would be able to go places their self with out riding the bus, and waiting and catching rides from other people. 
because, school is just a place to learn, everybody who goes to school learns at least something in school 
The last ship to try to land on Venus was three decades ago. 
The author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful.It can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing , and when using the FACS it can probably not show it. 
Even just in the name of that article explains everything that event he "best" type of system can be a dissaster, and the entire article cannot be quoted but hopefully with that one quote the point will get across to the people. 
I do think that all students should be required to perform community service. 
I feel that we should change the Electoral collage to a direct vote 
Even in movies, the driverless cars end up having problems or malfunctioning quite a bit. 
A great example of this is when my friend Generic_Name got in a fight once. He got sent to the office and was claiming he didn't start it and it was self defense, so they called in a few people who saw what had happened and found out Generic_Name was telling the truth. This is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. Another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. This highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical. 
For example, the Electoral college avoids problems and tries to fix eveything so that everyone can be happy. 
Students in this school should have they're phones left at home because on a test day a student forgot to study him/her texts a friend who already had that class ask him/her for the answers, and that right there is cheating. In order for students to get a good education they need to be well aware of the material in each class study for exams, test etc. and so further more if the students are distracted by they're phones the Teacher who is Teaching that class shall take up the students phone and keep it for five days with a policy of five days at the end of five days they must pay fifteen dollars to get it back. Another reason would be if students are not educated enough and they fail the TAKS test your school will be the lowest in education and there for we the supreme independent district will have to fire you from your current position as school principle. 
If you switch to popular vote more people would be more likely to vote because they could have more confidence about their vote. 
If anyone just simply appealed to a certain region in the US, the other regions would feel as if "the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president" (paragraph 19, last line). 
After that,the mission trying to look again. 
Most decisions do not require much in-depth analyzing, but there are some can be very hard and draining to make. No matter how exhausting this can be though, there are always methods to make decision making more bearbale. One way to make this easier is to seek the advice of more than one person, as this can lead to the best choice. Others who have already been through what you are going to can give helpful advice, as well as make more inclusive decisions and give a different view on issues. From this, a person can take the best and most fair actions to help them succeed. 
The reason for this is that you can tell weather the person is really smiling or not 
Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable. 
All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. The citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.    
While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, 
Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to "face landform". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed. 
Moreover why you have to keep the electoral college is because when they vote for their president they are trusting on their electoral because if they vote for their president they are actually giving a vote to their electors. 
Each one tells us how choosing the president and shows us a map how it works and we can see which state shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. This is something that can help us understand how to vote and how long they will be the president or the vice president 
A dispute about the outcome an Electoral collage is possible but vary hard to because you may have other poeple wanting it but may not see it your way. Every electal vote needs a presdintal vote to so if we do the math you have a state and a country aginst you so the odds arent in your favor. Now there is a method called winner takes all and it basicaly what they say gose! 
Teachers should gather together and create the summer projects based off what they know that we will need to know for the upcoming years. 
Will delivering food, supplies, animals, and more you can go sightseeing. 
The student away from sicknesses that may be spread due to the mass amount of people in a school. Staying at home and learning keeps these students away from any harmful sicknesses that may be caught at school. This may be very helpful for people that are more prone to sickness or have weak immune systems because it keeps them from the danger of being seriously harmed. 
He believes that it was a sign for something that the aliens were going to end up doing. 
because I mean who really cares what other people are feeling, unless you're close to them. 
Secondly, The electoral congress keeps the organization of counting the votes and declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes (The winner) 
I have concluded that though it is risky and dangerous to study Venus, I think it's worth knowing about it and it's contents. It's a great challenge for us humans but that is what makes it worth knowing about. What if Venus excedes our expectations and we find something that could possibly be life impacting? I think the danger and doubt would be worth it and our thoughts and assumptions would rest at ease. 
It will keep students busy and occupied; thus, they won't get into trouble as much. I was once told that if you are bored, it can often lead to trouble because if you're busy you have no time to make trouble.Also, by having students do extracurricular activities it will seem as if the school gives off lots of well rounded students who have many skills. This will seem very impressive. Lastly, the school's students will most likely have a higher grade point average (GPA) and better scores in general compared to schools who don't require extracurricular activities. This is because studies show that students who do extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs have done better in academics and will learn time management and balance better than other kids. This is why enforcing extracurricular activities will improve schools. 
students would be able to pick a subject that they know they are good at rather then them doing something they have no experience with. 
In this passage I learned alot that i did not know about. I personally think he did good in this passage because he made me learn and i enjoyed reading this passage . I learn about venus and learn about NASA and what they might going to do.  
A study done by Jake Miller at the Maryland University of Health shows that when someone comes to another person for advice their trust in them normally increases. Mr. Miller Claims that, " You install a certain level of trust in someone when you ask them for advice, if it be something small or something huge. Asking for their opinion on a situation also boosts the overall relationship." More over, their advice doesn't only just help the situation it helps strengthen your relationship with those people. Plus, most of the time people are more open to helping you when you have a sturdy relationship with them. Not only does asking for advice show that you trust the people your asking but it can even help strengthen a whole groups relation and trust. 
also don't you see all that violence out there 
to help out clean our streets, and parks 
Group work is important because students learn how to compromise, communicate, and get along with different types of people. If learning is done online, they miss out on the opportunity to develop their social skills. Social skills are necessary in day to day life since we are constantly interacting with other people such as bosses, coworkers, and strangers, for example, at a grocery store. Students should be able to develop those skills throughout their school years so they can be successful in the real world. 
Our state just like many others have a "Winner-takes-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate." 
If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom. 
According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, "A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but it is highly unlikley..." There's a shockingly short ammount of votes required to turn an election into a situtation where both canidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occured in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plumer, "a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way." Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote. 
I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is. 
One thing about Venus that it is the closer to Earth in way like the density and size and sometimes occasionally up close in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, these three plants are like right next to each other like they are friends or neighbors and other plants orbit the sun in a different type of speeds. The differences in speed is that, we sometimes closer to Mars and sometimes its Venus. Its like play musical chair, but the three plants goes in different speeds then each other. So, since Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space, humans have to sent numerous of spacecraft to the land on to Earth.Each pervious mission was a failed mission because no spacecrafts survived the landing, not even a few hours. And, its because a thick atmosphere that was a big atmosphere of amost 97 percent carbo dioxide blankets Venus. What's even more of a challenge are the clonds of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere that maade the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth. 
Such as we could be texting a teacher our answers or looking things up. Also, you could play the quiet game and then just have our phones and then we could be texting each other back and forth about question and other sorts of things 
Students can get distract at home because they have easy to use phones. 
In many schools the physical expression of everyones face doesnt really matter to a computer. The communication with students and computers is a bad idea because it won't have good outcomes to many people involved 
Even in the United States cars are becoming less relivant.Not because they are not useful but because cities are becoming so compact that there is no longer a use to drive cars to stores and shops. The only time people drive is for long distance or to work or school when it is cold or raining 
First I think that SCHOOL_NAME should be a loud to pickup trash from the community. 
I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, 
Veus conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. 
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE?At long on the History, There's strange and curios case in the story of the political, especialy in United State of America (U.S.A) The political allways had serius problems, like corruption, the confusion of what president choose, the bad counting vote, etc. But with all those problems that happens in the world.. How United States choose good presidents? First, we are going to talk about the curius case in the U.S.A talking about the political and how U.S.A choose the future president. 
''under the electoral college systems voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry on the off chance that those electors won the statewide.the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidxent who recevies the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this potion.a dispute over the outcome opf an electoral college vote is pooible it happend in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reasons is that the winning candidtes share of the electoral invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote in election for example obama receievd 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.cause most of the states awared electoral votes on a winner take basis even a very slight pluerality in a state landslide victory in that state a tie in the national nationwide vote is possible cause then total number of votes 538 is an even number but is highly likely.    
Attending school in person often means you will receive a tremendous amount of hard-copy and paper handouts. However, digital schooling and online schooling often uses digital copies of these handouts and online resources such as Google classroom and Google drive. The various resources allow the everyday student to be exponentially more organized as rather then creating countless physical folders and carrying around hundreds of papers, you can simply have access to everything you need from the touch of your phone screen. Digital education also allows students who have trouble asking their teachers questions in person while in front of many other students to articulate themselves personally to their teachers without being seen by their classmates through several available functions that come available with digital educating. 
There shouldn't be a discussion when it comes to texting and driving for obvious reasons. It's just as dangerous as driving under the influence. 
In paragraph three it state, "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," saide Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor." 
The scientist thinks that the face was madeby aliens but I think it wasn't that it's just a natural landform. 
The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors. 
Thats why i think the elctoral college deseres to stay. Not because al gore got mad cause he was favorite and still lost but over all i think that just because thats omething bad happend one time does not mean that the whole thing has to go down in flames. Like i said we need to keep it we have had it since the 1800's and there is literally nothing whrong with it so those are my reasons on why the ellctoral college should stay.    
Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one 
What happens if a driverless car causes an accident? 
You would not be hearing about tragic deaths on the news caused by distracted driving. If you realize it, there are more teenagers out on the road getting killed because of phones more than adults. I'm pretty sure adults got the hint when they realized that they were putting not only their lives but other people's lives in harm's way. 
Although it may be a better environment for students to go to classes and communicate in real life with their teachers and other peers, It would be more beneficial for students to have the choice to attend classes from home through the use of either online courses or video conferencing. 
but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults. 
My response to that not everybody is chosen by politcal party. 
I think that community service is a great thing to do, but should not be required. 
Vehicals that dive on there own can be very dangerous. 
As you can see the Electoral College overrided the popular vote which ultimately made him president 
You cant just go back and erase it off the Constitution 
Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. 
''The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.'' Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this ''pressure'' can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again. 
Also i would use policy 2 cause no one would for get to turn off their cell phones 
Thats not you can do or see being a seagoing cowboy you can go to other places like greece 
I always did love taking care of animals and doing other stuff as a crew of the Seagoing Cowboys.I am here because many people argue whether be a Seagoing Cowboys is something you should do. 
So those are the resion's why I think the Facial Action Coding System would be valuble in classroom's is that it could tell if a student is having a hard time doing the work or just does not like the work they are doing and another thing is that it could help the teacher or other stundet's know that one of the stundet's is unhappy and that they might need someone help like they are haveing a bad day or they are feeling sick. And so thats why I think the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable for.   
I think that drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving but only if emergency & navigation. 
Astronomers are not going to give up. there going to try and fight/fix the differences and let nothing get in there way. 
With the idea of no school, beaches, and long nights, students won't be focusing on work. Students then tend to lack academically because their brain hasn't been tested for quite some time. Brain activity never stops, even when sleeping, but it does forget how to preform in certain circumstances. Luckily, teachers understand that this happens because even teachers go through this mindset. They don't give these assignment because they feel like it, but because they know who teenagers are. If students begin to expect no work during breaks, this will continue to occur 
Could attending classes from home via online or video conference be a beneficial option that schools offer? 
I believe that it is a good idea because everyone should be taking a part in making the world a better place. 
You can develop potential arguments to strengthen your side and you can know everyone's views to go along with your subject. Based on what you learn from everyone, you could get the full circle of information on what you'd like to learn about. 
I  can see why people dont like that because certain states like florida has the maximum of 29 electoral votes, but wyoming only has a maximum of 3 electoral votes. 
The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. 
This can benefit the person because it can help them find more easier ways to solve their situation. When people have problems and ask more than one person for advice, it can result into find more ways to solve the situation because the person can find solutions that can either cause more harm to the persons life by making a bad choice, or just finding more than one choices that could the persons lives in many different ways. Having more than one solution to the problem is a good thing because when you try to solve the problem and it doesn't work out, you can always find more ways to try to solve the problem until you find a way that it works out for you. Finding multiple choices to solve a problem also ties in with different viewpoints and a different understanding of the problem. When these are applied, they can both help the person find multiple solutions because with different viewpoints, they can get others opinions and figure out an answer there, and with a different understanding of the problem, the person can find a deeper meaning of the problem, and find a easier solution there. Finding multiple ways to solve a problem can help lead people to better choices because when receiving advice from other people, it can lead to having multiple ways to solve the problem. 
The air is thick for humans and the clouds have high corrosive sulfuric acid. These things can harm humans breathing by senting them to Venus. 
My name is PROPER_NAME and i am an American Citizen. I already know about The Electoral College and its process. I know it has 538 electors and 270 of the electoral votes are needed to elect president. Along with that, I know that our founding fathers developed it in the constitution and their chosen by the candidate's political party. But i do not know why so much people bash The Electoral College when its a good thing. 
It's all happening, everything i said in the begining...about the trouble. Why the senate gets to choose the vice president? why cant the qualified citizens choose for there selfs. That whole area needs some enjustments before they start chooseing for people. 
On top of that if you talk to more sources they will most likely have different opinions from one another. Along with the other reasons the more different opinions those sources have the more advice youre taking in so you can make a smarter decision for yourself. 
In the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer it says " ...The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best..". 
it would help teach some independence 
The FACS machine would be able to tell whether a student is lying, 
if there was an other policy i would have 2 say put our phones on lock or sleep or when we attend our class we put them in a box and when class is over we will get them back. but like i said i agree with both policy. A lot or students may agree with this policy just b. cause it have has 2 involve cells phones and we just want 2 use them cells phone are good in some ways 2 bring them 2 school and in other ways they are not every body has there own opinion. 
While you may end up pleased, others may feel the complete opposite 
One good benifit from this is that teachers can teach more to kids in a more faster way so they can get more things done, 
NASA has had an idea to send humans and study Venuse. it also talkes about how they have a blimp like vehicle hovering about 30 miles over Venuse. It talkes about if they sent any vehicle to Venuse it would have to avoid the harsh ground. 
"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some ... areas in the United States." (Source 1). Personal cars directly contribute to greenhouse gas enissions and by cutting down personal car usage and encouraging the use of car pooling and public transportation we can decrease greenhouse gas emmmisions. Also walking and biking to your destination instead of driving helps encourage healthy living and habits as well as exercise. 
If you can't get in contact with the hospital, because a student can't breath wouldn't it make sense to just use our phone during free time if that happened to let them know, because you are usually not out during free time and if that happens it could be too late to rush the student to the hospital if we have to walk or run a long way to just get to your office or the front office to let someone know that, " hey there's a student across the other end of the school that is not breathing, then you would have to ruin all the way down to make sure so it would be to late for them to come right? Instead of just letting a student call then the ambulance would be here already and it wouldn't take forever 
The majority does not follow the consitiution when voting for our new president, thus inducing an unfair campaine and an biased leader. The consitiution clearly states the Church and State are to be seperated, yet many Americans vote baised on the beliefs of their Church on matters of the State. The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said "your love exceeds that of a woman" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like 'who will this affect' 'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans' 'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole. 
One effect of taking advice is new ideas 
The whole smart car idea yes its a great idea but what about getting your permit an you licsense? Im sure on a driving test we wouldnt be able to use our autopilot to park the car. 
They can have phones in school but off in your locker or pocket. 
than alwys studying our panet and Venus sometimes called the "Evening Star," is one od the brighest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur strgazer to spot. 
I say that they shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to. 
It showed that, with someones faith you can and you will achieve something great out of life. If no believed in him, then he wouldn't be working in that company that his teacher told him to join and he wouldnt be doing nothing in his life that he would've liked. 
Well, I think all the students from fifth grade and up should take on the responsibility of doing community service for their school 
It will leave students with no time for their other not-school related activities, yet another forced school related thing taking time out of the day that isn't school. Forcing students to join a club will create the same effect homework has on students. They will form a hatred for clubs, just like many students have for homework, because it leaves them with less and less out of school time. 
Engaging learning with enjoyable hobbies can be beneficial for the teachers' satisfactory and the students. 
Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken 
last, but not least, they will just have better connection because they wont have to worry about getting information at the last minute. 
Another reason we should have it is becouse why would you want people to know your exact emotions anyways 
muscles in the face just act naturally 
Even though our founding fathers established this act it doesn't mean it benefits our country. 
becuse it is a neighoring planet as well as earths twin and could have been inhabitable a very llong time ago meaning lifeforms could have been living their or still live on venus. 
The Electoral College is a system use for citizens to pick who they would like to make and force the laws. "The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congess."- Source 1. It's many steps to picking a president. You have to pick candidates and those candidates have their share of electors, which are chosen by a political party under certain qualifications. "The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are . . . ." 
Community service is away to interact with other people and helping them out. 
A student who is too sick to attend school, needs to rest, and concentrate on getting better so they can attend school, not worry about the assignments they have to do or lessons they need to learn.If school is canceled for inclement weather, many students might lose power or internet service and not be able to get work done.Students who have to travel often due to highly competitive sports do not have time to work on assignments while at tournaments, games, and competitions, but coaches for clubs and travel programs have rules about the grades their athletes have to keep to be able to play and travel; this will keep athletes from getting far behind and from being unprepared on graded assignments on new subjects. It would not be beneficial for students to have virtual learning because, when students are not going to come to school they are not going to do school work. 
These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on planet earth. 
Electoral College even sounds like a well thought out idea 
I think for the election for presidency its should be counted on the popular vote. 
The voters in the South didn't see any campaign ad by Romney which was not fair because he was not concerned about them not voting for him. 
This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, "the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised." 
Semi-driverless cars are a thing that can just be in the backround to aid drivers in situations and provide them with a way to get away from the stress of traffic, making them better drivers. 
according to artcile 1 elctoral college consist of 538 electors. and a majority of 270 elcortal votes is required to elect the president. According to 23rd admendment of the consititution the district of columba is allocated 3 elctors. each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of elctors. they can be either deicranditate or republic. 
In Red Silver, New Jersey, RELATIVE_NAME, who was very good at basketball was unable to play in the championship game because his grades weren't that well. As the game was close come to the fourth quarter,RELATIVE_NAMEs team couldn't hold onto the game. RELATIVE_NAME was averaging 22.9 points a game, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, and those statistics in the championship could've made his team possibly win as they lost by 20 points. RELATIVE_NAME missed being eligible for the game by one point in his average.His average was an 82, which is a C, andB average is an 83. RELATIVE_NAME missing the championship game affected his team for the worst, as the RedSilver could've won its first basketball championship ever. 
The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. There is region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president. some people has no incentive to campaign heavily in the states that they are regionally favorited, becuse they will not gain any electoral votes by increasing their plurality. 
(Obama did end up winning and was titled as the 44th President of the United States. To others, they may say that each persons vote does count but it doesn't seem like it. 
so far I have told you about all the good things about being a seagoing cowboy it is also dangerous. 
The disaster factor got the name from the 2000 fiasco.The question we are all worrying about is what if it happened again?We dont want to go through it again,we might not get lucky as we did from the 2000 fiasco. 
the only downside to this is that in cities buildings are farther away then they are like in passage 1 where as everything is in walking distance, but in cities that are meant for walking to different locations would cause a major problem with older adults 
For a driverless car to be a good idea and be suitable for everybody, it needs to be completely safe for everybody. In the article, the author tells us that most driving laws focus on keeping the drivers, the passengers, and the pedestrians safe. We all know that safety is the most important way, but what is the best way to keep the drivers, the passengers, and the pedestrians safe? The author tells us that lawmakers already know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. How are the drivers going be alert when they are in a drivetless car. What if there is a system malfunction? What if the driver falls asleep while the car is driving itself? The outcomes don't look good. 
lthough driveless cars are depicted as futuristic and magical, really driveless cars seem like more of an endangerment 
I believe that popular vote has and will contine benifiting our community by equaling out our rights. Helping people get to know the presidents better, and helps the better president represent us.   
Community service helps out the community a lot, so the students will be making their homes a better place to live and learn. 
Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros 
EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again. 
Use of the Facial Action Coding Sysytem can be very valuable for computer learning in the class room. This system can detect emotional expressions of the user which would then cause change in the computer teaching. 
The reasons stated above show how and why that driverless cars are a must for everyday life as we know it. They save you money by not having to pay so much for gas everytime you have to fill up. The car is being driver by the hardware that is inside of it and it will notifiy if you need to take over and steer. The last reason is safety. If the car is not safe, it should not be on the road. Driverless cars are allowing the driver to pay closer attention to the road as well as what is happening around him better than if he had all the lights in his face and his phone placed in the cup holder or in his lap. The driverless car is being developing to become something greater and more useful for everyday human life. This shows how and why driverless cars are a must for everyday life and why I agree with the developement and manufacturing of these cars. 
In Paragraph 8, the author claims, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." The author brought up the word "challenge" again, 
then no canidate can get the most votes in a vote cast. According to the article Does the Electoral College work source three states, Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurity or the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College(301 and 307 electoral votes respectively 
The final reason that attending school from home is not beneficial is that their would be a loss of social skills that a student learns while being in school. 
Students should be required to do a certain amount of hours for community service before they graduate. 
In Source One the story talks about the advanges of redusing car usage in the German areas. It states that cars produse about 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in major car usage areas in the United States. Also, street parking is generally forbidden on the outskirts of Freiburg. Even though Vauban's street are completly "car-free", except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there is only two places to park, in a large garage outside their development where a space costs $40,000, or in their own homes. Because of this, about 70% of families in Vauban don't own car(s). Along with 57% of people that sold their car so they could move to Vauban.In Source Two, in Paris, everyone who drove a car was fined, in two days about 4000 peopole were fined? That isnt actually a alot for a whole city, which is great news. Paris uses diesel fuel instead of gasoline, and now Paris is blaming that on their air pollution. Paris usually has more smog than any other European capital.In Source Three, Bogota, Colombia has the Day Without Cars, where only public buses and taxis are allowed to drive in the city, anyone driving a car will be fined $25. the Day Qithout Cras started in the mid-1990s, and since then 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. Parks and sport areas have also been built, along with more restaurants and shops near streets that used to be heavy with traffic, but now leave room for people to stop and visit.In Source Four, it states that in the United States, young people driving decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses each year.    
This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet. The author also states, ". . . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth." If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet. Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet. Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing. 
It gives students, at home sick, the opportunity to keep up with the pace of the class, instead of missing a day. 
Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. 
Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars. 
For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite. Removing summer projects all together isnt an option, 
So think about it. Do you think that driverless cars are right for our future or no? 
Comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces 
how many car accidents happen every minute around the world? I bet a lot. And why are there so many car accidents? Problaby because there not many of smart driver being asisted while on the road in traffic. Just imagine if that could be prevented. 
I believe that it is worth it, and I would know. 
We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. 
new perspectives are provided 
One reason as to why people should not be able to use their phone while driving is because the risk of death is so high 
The author gives good reason to why trying to land a spacecraft is not the best option to obsevre the planet 
Throughout the school year teachers provide projects that are essential for learning the content, but prevents students form using there creativity and expanding on their freedom to think in different ways. During the summer if students were allowed to develop their own projects they would feel more free, this would allow them to experiment with different ideas and concepts, this also would allow them to figure out which way they learn best. While being away from an instructor such as a teacher, kids could use their own ideas to create a project, that is not influenced by others, and this would show schools and teacher how much a student truly understands not just the knowledge that a teacher is forcing upon them. A sense of freedom is also important for preparing students for their next step in life, whether it is a higher education level, or a career, because, it is important students get an experience learning by themselves. 
Some people think the face is "bona fide" evidence of life on Mars 
There are alot of ways we can actually save the eletoral voting system 
The conspiracy theorists don't have as many facts as NASA to back up their information and ideas. NASA has majority of the information and facts which over rules the conspiracy theorists information and facts. 
In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
. If we start looking at exploring Venus as a challenge instead of a risk, it could possibly give researchers more motivation to get out and explore. 
But WHY is it worth studying it? Well, Astronomers are fascinated and interested in the past of Venus as many of them has theorized that might've used to be a lot like Earth from long time ago, with Venus used to oceans that support life like ours. Another reasons why it's worth the trouble and money to study it is that Venus could be our next Planetery visit as our nearest option. 
Losing the Electoral College can also avoid any mishap in the future. 
Everyone likes to have fun, that's undeniable, but is it fun when you're told you have to do it? Although playing a sport you love or spending time on the year book is fun, it's unfortunate that it wasn't really you're choice to do so. 
This can really help people out knowing others emotions. 
Some may do better by planning out their day based on what works for them. For example, school is typically an 8 hour day, from 9am-3pm, 5 days a week. This is probably fine for most, but others simply can't operate like that. For example, some people might feel more attentive in the evening, and therefore can be more productive then. Some might have a hard time focusing for long amounts of time, and do better with breaks throughout the day. The list goes on. Traditional education is usually very restrictive and doesn't accommodate for people that don't do well with said issues. 
This is why scientist think it a worthy pursuit to keep studying venus. they are getting closer and closer to overcoming this challange. they have allot of options on how to survive on venus. Once they get it it can help us with allot of things. thats why scientist wont stop studying venus. 
The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face. 
If you sign up you'll get the im-not-gonna-regret-this kind of feeling. CRACK!Is what the boat does whenever you hit a rock but you wont have to pay for the damage we will. If you want to work for us more than two years the boat you drive will be yours thats right folkes well give you the boat. All you got to do is sign your name and well even throw in a free sailer out fit with new shoes and hat. Once you get the hang of it you'll be like this is a peace of cake. The boat comes with a horn that will-tell-everyone-the-boat-is-okay and so are you,but all you have to do is sign a couple of papers and fill some documents out. 
it would tell you alot about what a person is feeling and thats important to know. their are many excellent and well reasoned examples of why this technology is valuable. 
are just what us as Americans want/need to hear because its really expensive. It's not just about buying a car and running it off of air;your car takes gas,car notes,needs servicing every once in a while it's not easy owning a car. Studies show how much the driving percentaged dropped keeps dropping because of high expensive prices that we have to pay to own a car. 
Aliens could hav eindeed built it , but there has not been an actual sighting on aliens anywhere on Earth, and aliens are usually portrayed as bad people or ting sin movies or books so seeing that a Face on Mars is created by a alien would be kind of frightning because if they are portrayes as bad thing , why would they want a face on a landform. What does that mean? 
Next,with this car there are many negative aspects that will come with it including the expensiveness, 
Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys 
There are upsides and downsides to the Electoral College, but from a political perspective it is crystal clear that it is a better choice. Citizens for popular vote do believe it is unfair to the voters having a board of senators making the big vote/impact on the president, but those senators are highly trusted people who know what they're doing. I favor the Electoral College over popular vote because it helps avoid run-off elections, it uses the winner-takes-all method, and gives equal oppourtunity to smaller states.  
It may sound far fetched, but actually, FACS may be the best thing to come to schools 
The U.S Chamber of Commerce and some others agreed to abolishing the electoral college. Because of the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but the electoral college still has its defenders. The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Although the electoral vote may be unfair to voters it gives the president a better chance of winning the election. There is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral Colege vote but not likely for the popular vote. For this is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral vote exceeds it's share of the popular vote. For exemple, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney, in the 2012's election. 
Others may argue that the Electoral college helps break a tie 
I think you should keep the Electoral College because its a process that consist of the selection of the electors. 
One way is all the places that you travel to. I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program. 
The reason is, because anybody can say that they made a Facial Action Coding System computers. 
Alternative hands free devices such as bluetooth headsets can keep a driver's eyes on the road while also being able to communicate as necessary. 
Some people argue about the Electoral College turning off potential voters, 
I also think its faster to calculate because when you do electoral votes 
but i think it is bad because teachers for example would use it whenever and espically when a student is mad or acting strange or if the teacher and student got in an argument. 
The electoral colledge is the last deciding factor of who acuatlly gets president. How is that a democracy? 
The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the President by a vote for President and Vice Preident, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the preident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.                   
Electoral colleges are where electors go to meet up and vote for president and vice president 
Some students at school will get distracted with their phones during class while texting their friends or classmates. 
For example, if you were working on a project and you didn't seem like you were working fast, someone could give you advice that you could learn from to work more diligently. Another example could be when you were writing an essay but was struggling on your topic and got help from someone for an easier and better topic. 
so the united states will stay in electoral college forever but anything could happen to stop it.  
Through online learning, these students can be given the opportunity to flourish in society through a comfortable environment. 
it should be student based because the project would still complete its targeted goal and still help students have continuous learning over break. 
A more comfortable environment allows students to feel safe and makes work a little more relaxed and stress free. 
Before my 11th birthday, my dad gave me the choice to get a new Xbox, or a new beseball bat. He gave me the day to devide which one he should get for me. When I went outside to play with my friends, I decided to ask for their advice. Some of my friends that play Xbox told me to get a new Xbox so that I could play with them. My baseball teammates told me to get a new bat so I could share it with them. One of my friends that I asked, played neither Xbox, or on my baseball team. He told me to take the cash value of the more expensive item, and spend it how I want. I was so thankful I had asked for his advice, because I never would have thought of this in a million years. Along with opening new options, seeking advice from more people might open you up to new perspectives. 
he says," Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system." 
I think that not all the students should be required to do the community service 
My conclusion to this is that Venus is a dangerous place but I would like to see whats on that planet, and know if there really is any life form or oceans. If so the astronomers might take some life from there adn water to bring and test what it actually is. But they can't send people into acid atmospheres and scortching heat just to land on Venus. 
You can not only get second opinions in the medical field you can also get them in the emotional field. 
people have blind spots, because we're only human. 
Garbage on the grass, gum on the sidewalk that's what we see on our normal routine to school. 
we need more people to take care of are plant, and go do things that can help it. 
Voting for whos the next president can be hard. Theres so many things to consider, like who will support you the best and make the right desition. The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote 
If you give one vote for one citizens and one vote for all people who leave in United States that's more fairy for the candidat for the Presidential Electoral and for the citizens, 
Eventhough many people were not satisfied with the theory that NASA gave them, NASA went on to search for more clues as to which "alliens made the landform." 
The "Face On Mars" is getting talked about a lot lately. Many people have different opinions about the face. If you aren't familiar with the "face on mars" then you're probably wondering why there is an argument going around. You're probably wondering this exact question: "Why is there a big argument about "The Face On Mars?" 
The governor has to prepare the Certificate of Ascertainment.What the Certificate of Ascertainment do is that it declares the winning presindential of the state and it doesn't just declares who is  the winning presidential it additionaly shows you will electors are going to represent your state atr the meeting of the electors  in December of the election Year. Finally your state's Certificates of Ascertainment they are sent to the Congress of your country and the National archives it as part of the official  records of the presidential election. 
should stop woring about it becasue it may be boring sometimes or fun, but they should just know that we are doing this for a good cause by helping the community with feeding and clothing the homeless, helping out sick and needy kids that are at the Children's Hospital, helping with the MRDD children at their school, at the dog shelter, etc. 
There has not been any life found on Mars at this momment. 
I think that because it's good to calculate someone's feelings. 
The author also gives ideas on how to help make a possible trip to Venus easier and less dangerous. 
For example, doing community service by baby sitting, they will have experiences on taking care of their own child or children when they have them. With experiences at a young age, they will have known what it is like to take care of they child. 
In conclusion, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College because of the positive affects i think it has when electing Presidents.       
it cost a lot, 
Would students benefit from taking classes home? Some would agree and disagree. 
It will be harder for parents to do what they have to do. Especially if you have a family and walking a distance when your car could be at your house with you. Its not right to have car owner space along with a home because some people cant afford to pay all that money. If people give up their cars just to move. While there have have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking ,planners are now taking concepts to the suburbs. Vauban may be the nost advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. I dont think stores should be placed a walk way on a main street rather than in malls along some distant highway. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill be approved. Street parking,driveways and home garages should be forbidden in this experimental new district . 
Venus has a enviorment of very dangerous elements that can harm many living organisms and even nonliving objects 
Another advantage of cutting the use of cars would be less accidents 
because there are some people that don't even care about the earth as much some other people. 
students would face isolation. 
However, allowing the students to use their cell phones, would boost their morale, and make them happier 
Its not fair Texas gets 38 electoral but New York only gets 3. Way more people live in New york Than Texas. If they used election by popular vote everyone has the choice to pick which candidate they want to be president. 
To start off with the electoral collage should not stay and be the ones to vote for us because its we the people have the choice that we make to pick our leaders weather its the president or congressmen/women or even judges. 
Also, facial recognition can help people understand how others are feeling in certain pictures 
Another way to choose a student project would be an voting system, a select few would pitch in ideas that are teacher approved, that way we are still learning the curriculum but in a different/ active way; After that the whole class votes, yes or no. If yes it goes on to other classrooms until the verdict is reached on if the project is fundamentally helpful and play a healthy part on work ethic. 
For instance states like New York, Florida, and California are more populated than, states like Hawaii, Rhold Island, and delaware. 
There are 538 electors deciding our country's fate compared to 5 million citizens who have a fair understandment of the presidency. 
To me, there are a variety of things that can go wrong when you are allowing the car drive all by itself. There are too many questions that need to be answerd about these new cars. 
This is said in the text when it says, "Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements," (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos. 
Imagine your principal creating an extra curricular activity assignment that you have to choose whether to be in a sport, yearbook comitee, or student council. 
having one of these may be expensive 
This unneccessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down. 
This is just a rock formation found by NASA who thought at first it might have been an extra terrestrail creation. 
If you go out to the Rocky Mountains and look around you can probably see tons of Mesas maybe not as big ,but they are still the same natural landform 
If you ask someone for advice, they may be able to take something they learned from a choice they had to make. You can apply that to the decision that you need to make. When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to "find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable." That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation. 
In class students usually use phones even if they are not supposed to and will text the person on the far side of the room.Some teachers should have the students turn their phone off and put them in a shelf, with a lock so nobody can steal or grab their phone. 
The electoral college may have been around for a long time, but is getting old. The systems it uses are irrational. Its methods are outdated and bias. There is not much reason for it. We need a new system. 
I think that we should be able to use our cell phones during lunch periods and other free time 
I think this because it help out our country. We will have less trash all over the streets. 
If a majority voting system was incorporated into the election system instead of the Electoral College the process would become much more complicated than it already is. 
And my final reason of why popular votes should just determine who wins is because they go out and vote and they feel like it doesnt matter. 
my second reason electoral collages help are state out are they help pick they rights states to vote. 
I say this because more and more people are getting these big trucks and they are not realizing that when that truck starts it is letting out bad gases that harms our atmosphear. 
there are opportunities to get help in other ways, 
I think if a student has a c average you should give him or a chance 
If you use policy 1 as your guide line, I expect you to not change any single word to the policy. You will expect us to not use them in class or anywhere at school other than at lunch or other free times. Thank you for reading this message and I hope you agree with me. 
And its not really fair that a person wins just because of his or hers own group of electors gets him to win it should just be based on popularity 
You can learn from the experience of others, choose the right choice more easily when looking at different solutions in a new perspective, and gain new information you can pass on to others, thus helping the whole process come full circle. It will benefit you greatly in the long run as well, as you can use anything you gain from these different opinions in future decision making processes. Clearly, it is always better for you to ask for a second opinion, no matter the decision. 
People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. 
the president that they think looks best. 
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Let us going back in time to see how did get here. During revolutionary war in United State of American. Some british had education, but there was not school at the time. Being able to give education for students it was home. And this was for colonies teaching them in group how they can introduce by themeselves and understand command they are given. Late in 1800s to 1900s system changed by government of the time because it began to underatand how education was imporatant to the people. It began to build some classes, so people will not struggle for taking class at home or under the trees. The challenge was not is because the main points was money and people need to do this governement used one idea to increase tax for everything in able to finish the plan. That is how classes have been found. Time of technologies a rise was in middle of 1950s were people began to use new material like box computer and other stuff. Today we do have many choice as for school we may take classes onlline, pay tutor at home, or taking classes at school. 
Any good teacher can deviate from the standard curriculum throughout their teaching, and an assignment on par with the syllabus prepares the student for this "improvisation." For instance, my literature teacher assigned us questions analyzing a book we had read in the year, preparing our brains for the material we would be seeing in the year. Although the curriculum calls for practice in rhetorical analysis, it does not discuss proper thesis writing: our instructor assigned us work for both of these. Every dedicated student in the class was not only prepared for the work we were given, but we were confident in our abilities to accomplish these assignments. On account of the deep analysis questions my teacher assigned to me over the summer, I was more able to excel in my work in language and literature, further driving me to learn more and become more accomplished in my English classes. 
I am writing you in concern of the new policy which you have been considering with the school board. In case you have forgotten, and I mean so in the utmost respect, it is just that people have a tendency to forget things, the new policy which has been suggested is to change school policy so that students are not allowed to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B grade average. 
i think that students should perform community service it would be great for our community and should be required or mandatory for the school 
The computers detect multiple emotions including: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (3). 
helping you community isn't as bad 
The first fact, the atmosphere of venis is 97 percent carbon dixide. If there was life on venis at once, then the life like creatures didn't last long. The planet venis could be the twin of earth. On the suface of venis it is about 800 degrees fahrenhiet. 
I believe that performing community service would be a great idea 
The disaster factor is when the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system also allows for much worse. Basically the system want's to see us fail. If the system would realize how bad there hurting us and making us feel like our  vote doesn't matter. For example, again the 2000 scandle with the votes for president. We voted for this guy and he won most of the votes from the states but the Electoral College desided to give it to the other guy. 
They keep with the speed limit adamatically, stop at aproprited time and also slow down when is needed. Adomatic cars will reduce the amount of accidents we have on the road by a lot. Accident are moslty caused by a driver, with adomatic cars, they will stop quicker than a person has time to react. But this plan will only work if everyone gets a smart car. Say if three out of four people get a smart car there will still be some normal cars left on the road, which with those cars an aciddent can be made. Self driving cars can avoid all the natural accident such as an animal running in the road or bad weather conditons. In addition to that many driver become sleepy or distracted when it come to driving, when self driving car are machines that will not do that. 
The projects assigned to the students during the summer should be designed by teachers 
it helps people support the enviorment along with decreasing greenhouse gas and smog as people will either take a bike or walk to get from place to place without having the traffic jam struggle. 
and allowing students with a variety of ailments to continue their education at home. 
is known as Earth's sister planet. 
One of the reasons why i think it's a good idea to consider the choice on having cell phones during school time is because there can be an emergency at home and our parent's can either text us or call us 
Another benefit to online education is the student learns time management and responsibility. 
Being able to ask questions to ones teacher as well a peers is necessary to fully understanding content. In math classes especially, clarification is critical in order to learn high level skills and ideas. Even if the online class involves video calls, technology could add another layer of confusion to the situation, while other students may not be able to benefit from hearing the question. This interaction between peers is also a very important part of true learning. In an English classes, group discussions help students share ideas and understand layers of books they may not have understood or thought of before, leading to a deeper understanding of texts. Overall, the online aspect of long-distance classes would complicate communication, leaving students confused. 
Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media marketse didn't get to see a single campaign ad. 
. Although, others believe the youth is too irresponsible to hold themselves accountable for such a tremendous responsibility, and is not beneficial for students. 
they would make it challenging enough, 
In order to prove they're responsible, they must be given some responsibility. 
Finally, I believe the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions can help help them be more educated by helping on their lessons, emotions, and control. Computers need to understand that, too (Dr. Huang). 
It can even indicate a real or fake smile 
This will help you freshen up. You will be able to see fish, seagles, whales, dolphins, and much more. You will see many other people and you can comepeat in baceball, volleyball, table- tennis, fencing, and evan boxing. Not realy the sportsey kind of person thats fine you can read, write, whisle, and play other games. 
Not only do the popular votes barley make a difference but, with the electoral college in play the representatives vote for our president, not us. 
every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities. I definitely think it would help out tons of kids to do it. 
You may ask, well what is wrong with the Electoral College system? Well under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president 
The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state's entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.Each candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a "Winner-take-all" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of "proportional representation."What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. There are 5reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of Democratic pedigreeCertainty of OutcomeEveryone's PresidentSwing StatesBig SatesAvoid Run-Off Elections        
They'd like it because they can socialize with friends while they get an education. That way they can just reply to their friends when class is over or if the class is having free time they can talk to their friends. Many students say they are going to the library to get a book when they get any book they put the phone in the book and do whatever. That is wasting their time and someone who actually wants to read the book. They think the book is being used for good things when its not. 
For my perspective on the situation, I am not positive nor negitive. Some of the ideas from bouth the positive and negitive side are good as thay are bad. For what I think is what I will pull from the story to my wrighting. 
The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth. 
however, video conferencing allows the student to still be at home, but also learning face to face with their teacher or professor. Having all of your courses laid out with clarity through digital aspects shows that it would be easy for any person to become more organized and efficient though navigating these courses with clarity at home and managing your time well in a comfortable setting with efficiency. 
I feel the elctoral college is overpowered and isnt neccsary 
You can see that aliens didnt make it because when they took the picture in 1998 you couldnt really see the face, but in 2001 you could see it 3 times better than the first one. When taking pictures you always have to get the right angle because either something gets left out or something dosent shows up. 
It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president. But it is not a democratic in a modern sense. But it is good because the people vote for a trusted slate of electors. But the trusted electors vote for the party`s nominee. Even though the Electoral College has a lack of most everything. 
In addition, Electoral College also hekps with responsibility 
By cleaning streets and parks, children will have a safer environment to live in and will grow up living in a much nicer area. It is a non-arguable fact that if a child is born and raised in a safer community, free from dangerous litter, they will grow up to be much healthier. From poisonous gasses and rodent killers, to little things like sharp glass and aluminum cans everything will be cleaned up. This prevents choking hazards and toxic fumes to be entered into a child's system. 
I think of people need make manny technology because actual computers can be trick 
Number 3, "Swing States" the "winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states". 
Students fall in environment learning because they learn at class when the teacher explain if students attend classes from home by online is hard they learn. 
maybe because he want some students to get on shape 
increase the chance of having a happier life. 
Lastly if you have all the people of the United States vote then the process will be more accurate. 
During a long day at school, have you ever thought what would it be like to be home schooled? Home schooling, or distance learning, is a route that many young people choose to do as their education. Many people wonder however, how beneficial is it really for students to sit in their living room instead of the classroom? As many schools offer distance learning as an option, students can learn online or have video conferences with teachers. This could be beneficial for students to go at their own pace, however, there are more factors to both regular and online school than people may think. 
Because of the Electoral College, Presidential Canidates spend a large portion of their time in "Swing States," like Ohio or Florida, and little or no time to states with predictable outcomes. 
it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace 
It's located on Mars at 41 degrees north martian latitiude. If you're sitting around bored at home just imagine all the amazing sites to see when you are visiting The Face of Mars. 
In the case of Mona Lisa i can see why they would use it there. It states that she`s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. I wouldn`t have known that if not for tech. 
it was 1995, world war ll was over in europe, and many countries were left in ruiens to help these countries you woiuld need to send many,many us army troops out to save them from all of that stuff ,like rocks that might have fallen on them and other stuff that might have harm them or others in there country ,luke was 18 before arriving in greece with means he could dafted for the military services when my draft board learned that i was. on cattel boat trip they told me just keep doing what i was, doing for my service the cattel boat trips were amazing for a small town boy like luke , he could learn. new things it was almost like he was a tourest when luke was helping out katie that was his aunt she owned a farm as a boy luke was hard working and brave but the sea's were , to dangerous for luke he could not handle it the first couple of days luke was happy with his job but as it got harded luke got more sad and unhappy with his job but being sea going cowboys was too much fun there was much mor to it thsn just having fun .                          
I am againt the development of driverless cars. 
A community with less cars has proven to also be one with less healthy citizens. 
I think we should change to election by popular vote because so that everyone can vote, 
A student should not have to worry about what they are going to do for a project.That is too much pressure on the youth.Instead maybe teachers collectively as a group come up with multiple project ideas for the students.Give the students multiple options on what assignment or project they would want to do.The teacher are getting paid to teach and come up with lesson plans.Therefore it should not be the students task to come up with any projects specifically one like a summer project. 
A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations. 
Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus. 
Some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the consititution is restored. The candiate must have trans regional appleal, meaning he/she must be all for each region & not just one, (South, Northeastern, etc.).  From this the residents of the other region are likelt to feel disfranchised-- to feel like their votes do not count, and that with no regard for their interests, the president is not really the president. 
Even if its just a homework club. 
it should be a praivlage to do a extra class because some kids dont get good grades, or they just dont want to 
When I am in school and a teacher starts to lecture, I start to thinking or even go to sleep. 
that is i good idia that we can have to vidio chat for a classes. yes student will benefis for that promgran because not all student can go hay have to work to help der parents. but some wish that they can go to scholl but on the same time he now that thay can not go 
The passage tells about how the planet Venus can improve and is useful. Venus could be dangerous, but there are many more reasons that Venus is a good oppurtunity to research on. There are many new discoveries not yet found. 
There are mostly benefits when it comes to having this addition to the schools policy, it would be a very smart thing to put in place. From making new friends, to doing better in school and later on in life, the schools fresh and more positive environment will be full of hardworking and high striving students. The involvement in organizations has a lot bigger of an impact than you think. 
kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of tha 
it keeps students busy throughout the summer. 
Some people may argue that if the kids design the project they will be more engaged and willing to complete it, 
Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. 
The reason is that winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds more than enough. Because almost all the states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis, even a vey slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible. But the stakes are highly unlikely to happen. 
some people would now how to keep it up and nothing would happen to it but if something did happen to it they wold know how to fits it real fast then you would be able to use it again if not you could build a new one if you would want too. 
Some may argue that the people's votes don't necessarily influence the outcome of the election since electors can still change for whom they vote for, so they request that the popular vote  determine who becomes president. 
In a system which would allow for the child to budget their own time from the comfort of their own home on schoolwork would enable the child put in the appropriate time which they need rather than spending too little or too much time on a particular subject or assignment. With the online classes only being an option, there are certainly teachers from the school which would be available to provide the necessary supplemental support. Also, the online classes could serve as an outside supplement to in class learning. Extra resources available to students with such great detail as being an entire online course would be invaluable as a supplement to what a teacher could provide in the classroom. Virtual learning could also provide a connection for a more individualized approach. Everyone learns differently, so creating an online course tailored to specific individuals or with particular goals in mind would greatly benefit this group of stragglers within the student population. 
Parents are always looking for new ways to give their student the best education possible, but for some, the options available are not suitable for their student. Distance learning is a possible new option in which students can learn from home using online classes and possible video contact with their teachers 
Since electoral colleges have been formed they have been disliked because they are thought of as "an anachronism, and a non-democratic method of selecting a president". Another is "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational". In most of the passage it talks about how the readers demise the electoral college. 
many people say that seeking multiple opinions can confuse the person who is asking, and will result in more problems. 
People can be complicated, one may never know what is going on in another's life. Every person is different, no one is the same as the next in any way, shape, or form. Taking classes from home would help eliminate those who are uncomfortable in the environment an everyday school would have, such as those with anti-social tendencies or anxiety. Having so many students in just one building causes many conflicts, whether they be through two students, or between a student and their teacher. Within a school, it is inevitable for there to be an issue depending on how one may react and feel. 
I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. 
In this voting method you are able to trust each member running 
with that being said, it proves a flaw in the system we use to elect the most powerful man in the world. 
Futhermore we have concluded that the "Face" on Mars is just rock formation. There is no futher information on the "alien" therory and that this is out of the picture. 
I have been dancing since I was three years old and I only did ballet back then but as I got older I started more styles such as tap, jazz, lyrical, musical theatre, contemporary, and I still do ballet. Doing all of those styles has made me a versatile dancer. On average I dance about 14 hours a week and it's incredibly tiring but it's also my passion and I love it. I wouldn't want to be doing anything else. Dancing has made me branch out, make new friends, and do what I love. Doing this activity has helped me figure out what I want to be doing forever. Being involved in dance has let me find out my passion and allowed me to become a stronger person. 
It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. 
It states in the article "Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong" "It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. 
because it is the closest planet to us but defining the risks it will take they are doing research. but they are trying to make a man pod for a human to go there and study it first hand. 
the fact is that the pressure of the planet being 90. that could crush any lind of living thing. There can't be a creature that live on a surface that is hot. The pressure of the planets atmosphere is 90, humans can be crushed easily. 
regardless of what the scenario is, if the reins were loosened a bit to let the student design the summer time project, chances are it may make the student happier, and eager to do more summer time projects before the next school year begins. 
like soccer my dad used to teach me how to play soccer but i didn't end up liking it but my cousin did he even ended up traveling the world because of soccer everyone is different i'm not saying that if you try soccer you'll like it but what i'm saying is you should try new things who knows you might end up traveling the world. you might even turn out to be outgoing you'll try something like skydiving something that i've been wanting to do for years or you might even like to do checkers something which i find pretty interesting but who knows only you will know when you try new things. 
This could also help with students being more organized when it comes to importuning things. 
I believe that theElectoral College is a good thing. 
Its helps the students outs when they are trying to figure out what they can do to help with each emotion you have. 
If we were to keep the electoral college there will countinue to have untrustworthy presidents or irisponsible presidents like obama,george bush jr, or ronald reagen. 
Earth's atmosphere is slowly starting to change due to the fact that chemicals and gases are being released from your very own car. As Amercia's population increases so do the risk of the the greenhouse gases, resulting in global warmming and the lost of some habbitats. "If the pattern persists .... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants",(Rosenthal 34). Stopping the usage of cars in our society will help protect not only ourselves but also the lives of those with whom you share with. 
Venus is like Earth in multiple ways like being able to support life. 
I want to see the world in a different way, if you've seen me in public, if I see a shady looking person, I start curl my fist into a ball, I want to be able to see the world in a different light 
If it was created by aliens NASA would've already found out. 
So as you can see popular vote is more fair and also a smarter method of things it gives the peoplle a fair chance to vote for who they want while also allowing them to voice thier thoughts.    
because you guys are giving out the information on the candidates to late or not at all. That SUCKS, for most states because they may not even get one advertisment about the candidates any where or even a commercial on T.V. 
becauseif they feeling some type of way let them be stop always trying to be nosiey be and somebody bussins its not right stop trying to be caption save o let people be let them leave they life then if people find out you sad gthry going to be all up in your face like just leave people alone and let them be 
Without a teacher, students can be easily distracted and may use the computer for innapropiate reasons instead of school work; consequently, students would not get any work done or gain any knowledge from the lesson 
It's actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students' health. 
Students with a grade B average will be rounded quite well, for they will have the smarts, as well as the athletics. 
Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. 
Congress should change the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. 
For some students the issue might be distractions, such as other students constantly talking or disrupting the classes, or it might even be the student distracting himself, talking to their friends instead of getting their work done and learning. Simply put, for some students, especially younger ones, a traditional classroom environment can be too distracting for a student to learn effectively. With distance learning, the parent would have more control over how much time the student spends learning and can manage their studies as well. In a classroom teachers have around 20-30 kids that they need to pay attention to and it is not possible for the teacher to give attention and watch out for this amount of kids 
but the Electoral College has been in effect for over 200 years, established by the founding fathers themselves in the Constitution, so why not trust that they knew what they were doing? Besides, when each party selects a slate of electors, they put their trust, which, might I add, is rarely betrayed. 
In Vauban, "stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway" (Source 1). This is not only much more cost-efficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where "parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up" (Source 3). Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well. 
The aurthor explains why people are so interested in venus and why they want to study and look more into the planet and its possabilities. 
Most kid these days are usually inside playing xbox, play station or sitting on there couch eating crap like chips. I have a neighbor who never goes outside he's always inside playing video games or watching tv. When kids do this they aren't getting anywhere in there life. When they go to get there first job the people will ask them if they have any experience and they will say no and then they will never get a job. See and their life is just going to rot away 
Students on student council show that they appreciate their school when they represent them. For example when student council does a sock drive and then goes and distributes the socks to the less fortunate, they are showing how their school feels, and that they want to give back to the community we live in. When the students on student council show school spirit they go to the school sports games, show up for fund raisers, and set an example for how other students should act in school. By showing this appreciation and spirit they set the bar higher for other schools and show that they support our's. 
By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve.  As stated in Source 1, "and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."  This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars.  By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly.  In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities.  "After days of near-record pollution," Source 2 says, "Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."  A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that.  By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment.  "It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants," a sociologist predicts in Source 4. 
Home schoolers are doing everything over a computer or a device which can strain your eyes and can cause long lasting eye damage. 
When you help others they will help you back. It is nesessary to what it important to others. 
It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser 
Another reason why it should be studied more and have future plans that someday people from NASA will land 
NASA wishes there was ancient civilization background on Mars so they know the full details. NASA doesn't even know the full story of the The Face, so how can people be for sure about anything. These are examples of why people are just assuming. 
Although driverless cars will not probably be 100% driverless, the creation of almost driverless cars is not far down in world history. The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless, will be beneficial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties. 
you get ideas from other peopleSupporting detail number 2: you get multiple opinionsRestate thesis: hearing multiple ideas gives you many options of advice you can take from ideas and multiple opinions. 
The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. 
A while back the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of quallified citizens. 
One reason people seek multiple opinions is because they want to go with the majority of the people. 
In conclusion, the author tells about how to identify human emotions and how they express them in ways. 
On my second trip I was the night watchman my job was to report to the captian every hour to tell him how the animals were doing one rainy night I was making my hourly reportI slid down a slippery ladder and craked one of my ribs 
First of all, this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format. 
the air is more dense and is a huge impediment to currrent efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes 
When a teacher assigns a project their are usually some type of regulations they must follow for the project and you are only allowed to talk about specific topics. This for students does not allow for creativity because they will only follow what the teacher's checklists has so they can get the best grade possible. 
It also says in paragraph 6 that "A classroom computer could recogonize when a student is becoming bored or confused". That could also help the teacher out a lot. Some students don't always let the teacher know if they are bored or confused because maybe they are scared or embarssed, but now your teacher would know if you were confused about something. She would be able to help you or do something a little more exciting. 
If technology, that can read and tell your emotions is put into a classroom, then many students wouldnt be focused on schoolwork theyll be focused on a dumb app or piece of technology that can read your emotions. 
Summer gives students a break from the long and hard work of the strenuous school year, therefore the stack of an eight page summer packet that may not be difficult, is enough to intimidate a student to cheat on it or simply not finish it. Student-summer-packet-designers understand the struggle and can make it a length at persuades the students to complete it on their own. 
But they would be making explanation to have their phones 
the authoer states that venus is eraths twin 
This new idea of limited car usage could improve our environment. 
Students would do a project on a topic they want to know more about and intrested in. 
While others might say no we need to get rid of the electoral college, because the senate might be bribing the voters, so he knows that he/she has their vote for sure.This is where it gets tricky. Alot of people might disagree with you because you have a different point of view than them, but it is ok if you disagree with them, because its your vote that counts. This might be what they say "It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational". The biggest arguments are, because people say that one of the runners in the campaign did something they wasn't suppose to do.At the most basic level, The elctoral college is unfair to voters. That is probaly something you would say if you was against the electoral college. 
Less polution polution is really bad in alot of countries i mean its so bad that its kind of hard to breathe i mean it would suck if yoy were on vacation in the carrabians trying to enjoy a nice tropical day outside but you can't why because you can bearly breathe with all that polluted air around so yea. 
If these children have the option to conduct their learning from home, they will miss out on important interactions with classmates, and also fall behind from a social development standpoint. And not knowing or understanding social cues or the proper way to communicate with someone, will prove a major hindrance to these kids in later years. 
I have 3 examples, first when the camera captured the picture it wasen't clear enough because there were wispy clouds. 
students should be able to do what they want after school. 
I think he should join the program beacause he is a good person in the story. Also I think should because he really does anything bad in the story he just things that won't get him in trouble. But also he is a good child in the story he deserves to be in that program because their is no actual reson he can't be part of that program. Also Luke does really deserve to be in that program because i don't think he has been in any other program in his life as it said in the story. But one thing that really stands out to me is that why cant he be part of that program because their really is no reason that he shouldn't be in that program.Why Luke should be part of the program. I think that Luke should be part of that program because in the story it said that Luke really wants to be in that program because he has worked his whole life to be in that program. And another one of the reasons I think that he should be in that progrsm because he has worked his whole life for to get that program and also in the story it said that Luke would not give up to get into that program and be part of the program because he thinks that he deserves to be in that program and I think that he is qualified to be on that program.why I think that Luke should be in that program. He deserves to be in that program because he their is no reason he should't be in that program. He is also a hard worker like it said in the text if I was Luke I would never give up to getting into that academy because if that was my dream I would never stop trying to get into that academy because I want to do something important in my life like join the academy Luke wants to join or be a doctor I never give up on my dreams. that why I think Luke should join that academy.                                 
Facial Action Coding System has classified six basic emotion- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associates each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. 
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Online or video conferencing is when students and teachers communicate through long distances through the use of technology. Students would be able to learn without the need to be in a classroom with other people. This would are able to help them learn more frequently and function more with the help of this learning capability. Students would be able to personally talk to teachers if there having trouble with work in class. 
It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. THe best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elsections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsih the electoral college! 
The prompt says to find good things about not having cars but I just cant because the bad is more bad than the good is good. 
A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things. 
I think the electoral college is a fantastic method of electing the United States of America's president 
if someone had hacked into the the cars mainframe 
Driverless cars can be useful, but could be harmful to the surroundings if the technology malfunctions. 
Sometimes something happens like sometime their computer act up or they need to be replaced so sometimes they are not reciving information from the robots and it makes it very diffcault to see what is happing in Space, and what is happing on the Plants. So sometimes the astronuts would have to go into space and retreve the robots themselfs and bring them back to earth so they can fix them if the robot is broken 
The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. 
They polute the air and they can be very dangerous. 
Each candidate had his or her group of electors. Mostly the political party like Democratic and Republican. he Electoral college is the established Constitution as a compromise between electionof the presdident by vote in congress. Popular votes for the election of the president is more meaningful then having 538 electors and 270 electoral votes. I think the electoral college doesn't work. 
People sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candiddate. Back in 1960 louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing all demoratic electors with ones that oppose John F. Kennedy. Somestimes faithless electors have refused to vote for their party. This is outrageous! What is this happens again 
if you play a sport then getting a second opinion is huge especially if it deals with an injury 
When it comes to seeking advice, most would go to more than one person lurking for answers. Searching for advice is a common thing in our life time, nothing to be embarrassed about. Gaining advice is an important thing in our life. It helps us all grow and understand the things we don't. Don't know something? Just Ask. 
A boy named Luke Bomberger got to do all of the things that you could be able to do, by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
The last one is that I made a good decision. 
The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well being later in life. 
Sure you had to clean the poop-ridden stalls and carry up heavy bags of oats, but the animals made great company. On rides back home, you could relax and play games with the rest of the crew. 
In the end, our travels on earth and farther should'nt be limitted but at the same time we are facesed with dangers and things we sould strive to do better in but we should do our best to look at the word without getting to close to danger. 
I think that is should be used. 
The Electoral College is a process, The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requierd to elect the President.Under the 23rd amendment of the Constitution, the Distict of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.Also each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.You help choose your states's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. 
With this advanced technology students will just keep changing if there smiling, if their mad, sad, glad, etc. and checking if the technology can actually do its job. 
Thomas Haung made a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model for the face. All 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscels. 
but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.    
Second, some families do not like this community and do not agree with how it works. 
I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
but we should not be required, because a lot of people would probably drop out of school if we were required to do community service. 
All students should be active so they do not have to disturb the class with their need to let energy out of their system. ALL STUDENTS MAY PARTICIPATE IN VOLLEYBALL, BASEBALL, FOOTBALL, TENNIS, SOCCER, BAT MITTEN, BASKETBALL, TRACK, HOCKEY, ICE SKATING, ROLLER BLADING RACES, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. 
In conclusion to the eyes of the government it may seem like a proper way to vote, but to us it's unfair. You should abolish the Electoral College for good so we can elect the right candidate who deserves presidency. In order to get rid of this process we should take a single vote from every citizens.  
Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true. They can predict about how people feel or their emtions. For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face". 
The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth 
I being a helpful person to the community and others who needs the help feel that community service is a pay-off to knowing your helpful. 
Dont try to per pure them in to doing it thats not fair to them and the teachers that have to stay for it. Sometimes its more easier to just take a vote to see who wants to do it and who docent. Some kids might get tiered of the same thing over and over again so try to make it like every moth or every six weeks. 
My conclusion to this hole essay is if you can explorie anything in life then you can take a risk and in doing a challenge on exploring venus or another name for it Evening star. Not just because it can give you a fun fact it can give you a differnet experion on other people and you can show other people that there can be a differnce in everythiung that you can do. 
Summer projects should be teacher-designed 
also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array. 
These are strawman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system 
In the article, "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," Bradford Plumer quotes, "Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President," Richard A. Posner states, "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president." This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America. 
While doing this less older people will be injured in activities such as cleaning the streets, their homes, and helping them with buying supplies needed for their health. This will cause a chain effect on them making them pay less for medical bills and more on other things such a necessities and other good that will help them through everyday life. 
so that explains almost all the troubles of this trip and exploration, but there won't be much to see through all the clouds and the fact that going to the ground is too dangerous what could you possibly do. The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest. 
The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. 
limiting car usage could be a good thing for some people. only if they like to walk and do fun things with their lives. 
The idea is to allow scientist to float above ground. About 30 miles to be exact. With them hovering 30 miles above ground they should be safe from the ground conditions. With that, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus; such as an device that was used in World War 2 that calculates under high pressure of heat and does not require electricity. 
i agree because some times the classes in oline make ease and is a good oportuinite for some students 
but various pscyhologists, notably Generic_Name, have disproved the claim, finding no evidence of maturity being linked to one's intuition or strive of creativity. In fact, this myth actually arose due to various reforms of the Progressive Era restricting children and immigrants' personal freedom, which continues to this day. Although many would deem this irrelevant, it is precisely the reason that we must not hold back to provide students with freedom in creating their own projects and avoid persisting a key issue. 
"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." 
You will have many adventures if you join. 
The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. 
Multitasking is a crucial thing in life for you will need to do it most of your life anyway. From running errands to visiting your doctor on the same day, online classes are able to allow time for multitasking. In 2009, they found out those who did online classes multitask better than those who were always on campus to take the same class. This is very good since multitasking is a crucial life skill, and online classes can help this at home. when at home online classes can allow a person to do his laundry, clean his house, and even do dishes and still be in class. 
Also this makes a single rep from Wyoming of 500,00 people has as much say as 55 reps for California who represents 35 million people 
NASA has one exciting idea for sending a spacecraft back but it would take time and money from the government. Don't get me wrong I don't like the idea of sending humans to Venus but 
hours without calling or texting is like a day without happiness. 
"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States" (5). In other words, cars are higly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris,  a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog" (14). By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. Statisticts show that fewer people  are using cars around the world. "A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009" (41). Sociologists belive that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They belive it will "have benficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions" (34). 
see what they like so they can do it the future. 
From my poin of view I dont everybody needs a car. Some people just buy cars just to sdhow not knowing the reasons for having a car. 
I think people will enjoy the new rule if it changed and be happy to use there phones in school. So i hope the principal will change the rule and let us use are phones during school but not in the classrooms. I think other students will be happy to be able to use there phones during school. 
Different people can take different pieces of information away from the same things. Sometimes people will pick up on completely different parts of text than others would. This should not be an issue, but when a teacher is pushing for students to make a project from one angle or perspective, it could prove very restricting since they did not form the same viewpoint on the information 
The Electoral College is a ominous process, 
Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. 
So, I think we should urge students to come if they need help or at least want to stay on the team or club. 
Multiple people will give multiple parts of the story and then you can piece them together to get a whole.Having more detail will help you form a stronger opinion based on the opinions that your advisers gave you.It is hard to get a lot of details from just one person, but the more people, the better.In certain situations, you may not have been advised on, but having more detail will help you figure it out.
they can get different perspectives, 
Why i think changing the election to the president with the most votes will help because its gives the president more opportunity or chance to have a fair election. 
Some may argue that it is the teacher job to prepare the students, and create summer assignments to reflect the year, 
The teacher would probably say that it would be useful for that technology. Some students probably wouldn't mine 
We personally think that it is safe to say that God decided to give mars this mysterious land form and not aliens. 
In my opinion I think people should turn their phones off while driving. 
Some students think that doing stuff like that is boring because their not getting paid. 
However, some may argue that some students will abuse this system so they could stay home because they wish to skip class and be lazy or maybe just want to stay home. 
Huber states, "We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way." So some of the manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. 
Although still proving to be an expensive alternative to normal cars, 
people who can relate about your dilemma will be the best help to someone who is struggling to make a decision on their own. 
driverless cars will be the safest way to travel from place to place. 
It all comes down to one point,we should let the Electoral College choose who they want to elect the president. 
It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election [source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our dispised method of choosing president]. 
Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing the project I do understand why. Students are young and may just want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. 
i know you want us to do well and all 
So what the picture actully shwode was the martin equivalent of a butt or mesa land forms common around the american 
This process is very well put together and simple. You vote for the  electors that then later on will be chossing your president. 
in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus. 
According to the LA Times, 253 million vehicles are on the roads in the US. Since there are so many cars on the road, safety is a pressing issue for the American public. At first it was concern over seatbelts, then drinking and driving, and now it is cell phone usage while driving. Since the rise of cell phones, more cases of drivers crashing due to being distracted by their phones. 
All in all i think the our principal should really think about our school doing community service because our word WILL become a total dump if kids of the futures don't put their foot down and start to cleaning our earth with community service and it is a good activity to do after school or in free time and not become couch potatoes and if students decide to tutor the education progress and the grade of our younger student will increase 
Many people argue over the fact that the Electoral College is benefitial or not. 
This is because some people vote for a president that they are not voting for. People wish that the person that they are voting should be president. Yes we should follow the constitutuion but something we should not follow at all. On paragragh 10 it says that when you vote you don't vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors. Then they pick who should be the president. People have the chance to vote for who should be the president. For,example, when something happen in 2000 gore and bush. Gore had the upper hand and was going to will but then instead of gore winning bush on. 
The Electoral college is a way of voting for Presidency. Electors are the people who consist of that. Their are 538 electors. A majority of the 270 votes is required to elect a president, The 23rd amendment of the constitution states that 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The candidate's political party generally choose the electors. The Presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesdaay after the first monday in november. Most of the states have a winner takes all system except Nebraska and maine. After the presidental election, the governer prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment". 
An example of relying on others is to build trust with a variety of people to make sure you know that person will give you a positive result. Another way to rely on your peers is to make sure you know them well enough to ask them for advice, and so that you don't go the opposite way of making a consistent choice. However, relying on your peers will make you feel more confident about their opinions, and consider making the right choice. Relying on others will help you follow success by considering others perspectives. 
The students who didnt do the project should have consequences like in school detention, and calls home. Teachers should design the project because the students should know how it feels to be a teacher. Teachers all ways design projects for the students so the students should design the project but their are some ups and down about students designing projects. 
Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hard working lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones. 
there isnt any at proves or gives an idea that aliens actually exist. But there is a lot of evidence that proves that the face was made naturally and is just a landform that happened to look like one. A few of them are we sent "Mars Global Suveyor" and it showed no sign of alien monument, there was a good picture taken of the area of the landform, and lastly if there was any signs of aliens or their artifacts we would want to know and explore it like you would 
I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. 
Because of Earth's simularities to Venus, Scientists see this as an oppourtunity for collecting data and planetary visits. 
Now the main concern I know you are worried about is class being disrupt 
If you're an adult, and you did something bad and you had to go talk to an elementary school, I would tell them not to do what I did because they wouldn't wont to be in situation I'm in, so then they would no not to do bad stuff when they grow to be an adult. 
many cars nowadays come with their own little carphone technology that will speak to you and do stuff for you.Apps like Waze make driving feel much safer and cars like teslas and the other cars I spoke about before can be great substitutes for phones while driving.       
I've heard you are deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. I'm aware some students think that community service is a waste of time 
If you only hear one side of an argument and not the other, you can't know for sure which side you stand for. Since you don't know anything about the other standpoint, you can't make an accurate conclusion. 
School districts only have a certain amount of school days they can miss before they have to start cutting into summer vacation, which is unfair for both students and teachers. Due to current events, the Corona Virus is making lots of parents and students paranoid, and while my school personally has around 15 days of off time since we didnt get any snow this year, that would either be 15 days of missed schooling entirely, or if we end up surpassing those days, the school year extends to meet the days required to be in school. 
In conclusion the "face'' to me is still just a land form. 
As of 2017, an estimated 270 million people have a cell phone in the United States. Cell phones have been an everyday object that is addictive and is used for the majority of a day. In particular, cell phones are commonly used while driving, even though it sounds dangerous. 
Students should be able to design their own projects 
So whats the point of voting if we aren't really voting? 
some disavantages of doing an Electoral College is if the president is bad the congress will get blammed. 
Sure there may be the usual kid that does not want to be around other people but there's not many of them. For example my friends and I enjoy coming to school because we see each other and also because it has a sense of competition in terms of who has the better grades. I think when other kids are around and doing better than you it makes you want to try harder. Second if a student you sat next to in math class or in history was doing better than you in your mind you would say, oh i want to be like that, making you want to try harder and ultimately do better in school. In any competition teams push themselves to the limit, whether its a race, the final of a championship game or the last play in the game, teams try their hardest because the other team is doing so as well. Students will do that too, but they need other students to compete with which would not happen in online school. 
For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students. 
It also states that "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidancy." This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. 
i say this because Face is a naural landform found on mars. 
This will tech the students a face muscle. It will help tham later on how to tell a reall smile or a fake smile. 
Keeping students at home would also help eliminate bullying in schools 
To actually learn an individual needs to be able to understand the knowledge that is going through their mind as they work on assignments, and there is truly no better way to learn than to self-learn while working on a project. Unlike tests or any other sort of assignment, projects give students more of a chance to actually learn rather than just memorizing knowledge for a sort period of time and then forgetting it the second they turn in the assignment. Making sure that their mind is continuously being subjected to complete the assignment over a long period of time consequently burns the knowledge into their brain and helps them to better retain it. Having students do the designing portion of the assignment as well would lead to even more learning due to them needing to know the content first and then being able to correctly complete it with no errors. 
Another reason Online classes are beneficial they're different schedule classes. 
Electoral college is fair to the eye of an elector. Is it though favored by the people knowing that their popular vote is pointless of a final president? 
The fact that I know that it's not a face, notice how by years go by, the face starts looking like an sand temple 
Of course the idea has pros but not that main one of them is that it will look good in college applications, but not as good as doing something outside of school without the principle telling you that you HAVE to take at least one extra curricular activity v. I WANT to take an extra curricular activity! 
the rule of thumb 
In conclusion, I believe that all the assignments that I am given during the summer months are well done and should be designed by the teachers instead of the students doing it for themselves. In the past the summer assignments that I have been given have not been too difficult and I never really minded doing them. The teacher is the one who teaches the class and if they expect us to have prior knowledge of the class then they should be the ones designing it. It is not going to be harmful and there is plenty of time over the summer for it to be completed so I do believe that a project designed by teacher over the summer is more beneficial then one that would be designed by a student.  
Summer project could be a great way for students academically but is it gonna benefit them in the long run as they choose their own path. A majority of schools in the U.S don't even have summer projects for students to do over brake. 
This can come in a few forms, depending on what the problem is and what is needed. It can be hands-on help with the issue, guidance to another person that can help more, or even as simple as some encouraging words, any of those can help solve a problem. For example, person one goes to person two and says, "Can you give me some advice on how to fix a flat tire on my car?" Then person two gives some advice. Person one asks for help with it because he/she didnt'd understand, person two declines. Person one goes to person three and asks the same questions, person 3 gives different advice, but person one still doesn't understand, so they go to person four, and person four offers to help person one. Person one and person four fix the flat tire, and that couldn't have been achieved if person one had just given up when he/she didn't understand person two's advice. Basically, getting advice from multiple can lead to someone just offering help. 
In the story "Paris bans driving due to smog"talks about how after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It says that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day, I think that this should happen all around the world, so the world can be a better palce to live in. Here is a fact form the stroy, " Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had a 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London" 
Venus is worth studying 
Some students have disabilities so some of them won't be able to do that stuff and they have to go straight home after school. 
Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system because people from long time had to covered the oceans to support carious forms of life to them just how earth is from us today. 
In paragraph 3, line 2, the author says, "All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." This means it uses 44 different muscles in the face to figure out someones emotions. This can be very accurate it seems like, if you have an investigation and you have 44 pieces of evidence, how likely are you going to be right? Very likely. 
no pollution and much more healthier people 
This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. 
Community service can help students with that by helping others and not feeling so alone. Like this one girl i knew was so caught up with her studies all she did then was go into her room and lock herself up. Later , when i noticed she'd gone too far i told her to help me clean up the streets that were covered in litter. She did and then from then on she found time for her work, friends, and community service 
I think students should have the opportunity to do community service, but they shouldn't have to do it. 
I also believe the driverless cars could put the country in even more debt. 
I think that they should keep our despised method of choosing the president. The way we choose our president every 8 years is okay. Nothing is wrong with they way we change our presidents. 
Now, the student could make up what they missed on another day 
If somebody can tell what feelings there exspressing can be helpful in a way by telling somebody like a doctors that studys people when there just angry, sad or happy. 
I disagre with technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom . 
I strongly feel that if you are in a good community that you've been in for a while, you should at least take your time and pay the community back somehow. 
My oppoion is that every school and family doctor should have this to save lives and more. 
personal connections with teachers 
but most times that is not enough. 
If our cars dive and control themselves what will keep the man behind the wheel alert or even awake. 
The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created. 
On the day of July 1, 2018 a new law saying that " Drivers cannot have a phone in their HAND or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving". Meaning you will get a ticket 
this shows and how dangerous it could be, but if we make it we can see stuff like the sun and notice stuff we cant see thru a camera. also, it would give out more conficence of going into space and going into a diffirent planet. 
Students are going to be put under a lot of pressure if they have to keep up with school work and take school activities which could cause stress. Also students sometimes won't be able to keep up with all the work and activities after school. 
The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. 
Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy. 
Altough many downfalls, "The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose" and "avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,"(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22). 
Because of this there are so many questions asked that are answered very broadly due to the fact you do not really know the correct answer. For instace, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding the public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, Sometimes the  State Party's central comittee, and sometimes the presidential canidates themselves. 
There are many other reasons opinions are so helpful but they help us in ways like making us feel more secure about a decision. They also give us feedback and different point of views. In some cases, opinions are given by personal experiences. Opinions are something you should consider when you're having trouble deciding something. It also helps you get a better understanding and make you feel more safe about decisions for important situations. 
I would argue in favor of keeping the electoral college 
It may help the community if students were required to do community service 
I feel most should do community service and that it is better for the earth 
In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity, and they will increase the amount of students who complete them. Giving students something they can choose will ultimately increase students work ethic and view of school. 
When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home. 
everyday pelple want to know whats going on in their government and you erase the fact and make them think the electoral college is the answer. you have to go back to making popluar vote a thing, 
If you chose the second policy you would have a lot of angry parents at your door. 
I will be telling you about a story called "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves." I think it is a good story. 
who would benifeiting off of driverless car? Yeah the rich would have them but, wouldn't they be more of a threat? 
Yes, the Electoral College Works because in source one it tells the reader the steps you have to take in order to be able to work. 
With the Eletronal Collage there are never a cerntain region i nthe courty that ets left out. For explame the south and north and every other place gets the same amout. ALso there always going to be an out come for the vote. The more popular a stat has the more votes it gets, so big it cause stats to egt more people coming. 
And while it may be good that the student is interested in the topic they are working on it sort off defeats the purpose of the project. Because the projects are suppose to be a introduction into the next year and a way for the teacher to learn about the students 
These diffrences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. The Harsh tempatures and low air pressure the raidation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans. 
¨Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads¨(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe. 
And the last reason is that we have factual evidence and credibility to back up that there's no life on Mars 
Its easy to do because you don't have to count  them up yourself. 
For instance, if you "lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry." The worst part is that the electors could be anyone you don't even have to hold a political position to be an elector, they could be very biased and narrowminded. That's why the Electoral College is unfair. 
Some people love to do community service and every minute they have free they take there time to help somebody.If you have nothing to do after school then you may need to do some community service so that the community can be clean or tutor some kids, because it can all make a difference in your community.If I had time on my hands then I would do community service but I do so much already I have no time at all. 
So that was twenty five years ago when they took that photo, so that proves that in that time, they didn't have all kinds of cool techology to take photos that are really clear. Unlike in 2001, they had really good technology to take clear images to take a photo of the mount or whatever you think it is. 
If every student were to participate is a after school activity or sport, then the school would keep getting better. 
In the article it states that the planets weather consists of "erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface" not hospitable for any space craft nor human life. 
It is very dangerous to text while driving 
. While working at home, student can relieve stress by taking a break or grabbing a snack, actions that are substantially harder to do within a school. Not only that, but students who have family members or pets can spend time with them as well to relieve stress. Overall, online learning will remove stressful situations, and help students properly address their school related mental health. 
In conclusion if we wanted to get a closer look at Venus then we would have to send scientist to venus in specially made space crafts to be able to widthstand the dangers of the sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere. n 
My cousin is home schooled. Her only friends are her neighbors and her teammates on her fencing team. She is a very shy girl and hates talking to people. If she were put into a school with kids her own age she might be different in the way she talks to people. This is going to effect her future in a way that might be difficult for her to get a job, buy a house, etc. Having relationships like those, with other students and teachers, makes getting through school a whole lot easier. These teachers push their students for success and online catting with teachers just doesn't form that close relationship like a teacher you see in person everyday does. I know going to school is hard and annoying, but it's those teachers and my friends that motivate me to go to school and get those positive grades. 
In this article " unmasking the face on mars" they are showing us a picture that was taken by a 1976 viking 1 photograph of the face on mars which is just a natural landform 
Although some students will miss out on the opportunity and experience of physically being present at school and going through their day with their fellow classmates, many students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
it is very dangreous 
In a hypothetical world where the autonomous car drives perfectly in all conditions, the driver would still be able to take control of the car and drive as s/he pleases and continue the drive as they wish it to be driven. 
If we are to switch to the popular vote, people would b fighting and arguing constantly, there would be no piece. 
Keeping the electoral college is the best idea. Some people might not like it but some would. 
In the article it says, "muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius." This evidence shows that even a computer software can tell what you're feeling by your face features. 
because you are putting more attention on texting then the road, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the car, and could get into a car accident or worse die. Texting and driving are worse than drinking and driving 
Many my agrue that, the Electoral college is there for our benefit. 
The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a good idea. 
With so many advancements in driverless cars, a world run by driverless cars is a possibility. The invention of driverless cars, safety solotions, and an increase in the driving experience all show that with development and research, truly driverless cars can be achieved. I believe that development on driverless cars should continue, so that they can be perfected and put into use, making driving better for everyone. 
2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis of the century. State legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Evidence form source 2 goes back to 1960 when segregationists in the louisiana legistlature almost succeded in replacing democratic electors with new electors that did not support and oppose John F. Kennedy thus proving that the electorial college cannot be trusted. Another reason why the electorial college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between "swing" states. Evidence from the 2000 campaign states seventeen states didn't see candidates at all. 
how it affects us 
I think they it just happend from natural landform. 
. By creating a system where students are able to work from home, unforeseen events such as an illness or injury will not be as great of a setback as before. 
In this essay I will be talking about if people should be able to be on their cellular device while they drive or should they not be able to? 
I think that a better way to votee would be to vote more often and give the electors another chance to be relected so that after a few months if voters changed their mind then they could reelect someone else. 
If you don't want to do any of those you can serve as the student council, as a result you will have to council others. 
Texting and driving is one thing you should not be doing cause a lot of things could happen and texting is not worth risking your life. When you can wait to text the person back or just get on the phone using Bluetooth to the car and talk, its better than risking your life or someone else. 
I know im not even old enough to vote yet and your probably thinking what is this kid talking about but i dont think it is right to vote for the president of the united states canidate and really not even vote for him. 
Despite the planet being close to us, we haven't sent any spacecrafts there in the past 30 years. The reason has alot to do with the fact that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere.On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that its alot of times hotter than the surface of our planet. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. 
First, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted. 
Summer projects should be teacher-designed 
But, than i'm against because how can the computer see what all the student are feeling like? 
because students are more inclined to learn when they have the liberty to decide their work, 
some students take the summer to travel to family members houses and stuff like that. 
Although in theory a student-designed project sound good, in practice the students will most likely struggle to make the project because of lack of understanding the project. 
more walking would be involved, 
the idea that the kid well be able to be more envoleved with there way of larning. 
But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on "what you need" is not correct 
The Electoral College shows many reasons why we should change it to popular vote. 
Many college students around the world use online schooling in comparison to physical schooling on a campus. In the United States alone, many college students choose to use online schooling for a number of reasons. Online schooling may be used by them to help balance their lives, choosing to be able to do their work at their own time, compared to being in a building or university, where the deadlines are strict and there is possibly a hard time balancing their lives and school if they have a family. Having that type of educational freedom is very important in that sense, as to help students, no matter how old they are, achieve their educational goals in less of a strict environment. 
I write to you because I believe we should keep the electoral college . There's so many reasons why I believe this would be better for the goverment and for the community . 
There is a lot of young teenagers and also adults getting into car accidents. Its because of our cellular devices, texting while driving. 
Distance learning allows students the opportunity to take classes which would otherwise not be available. 
when you ask for advice for people's help you might want to ask more than one person. 
however you don't necessarily get to see them everyday which can lead to not communicating to them and loosing the bond you have with that person. 
There millions of reason why it not valuable well for one a person could be looking happy in the picture but be reallly sad emotional 
some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn. 
In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. 
This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the outcome of the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election 
This allows for the kids to get a personalized education that fits best with how they learn. If one kid needs more practice, they are able to practice while another kid may be ready to move onto the next. This way the one that is moving on isn't being held back by the kid who might want a little more time on a unit or topic. Students create their own education plan which is also good for the teacher because sometimes it may not be easy, in a classroom setting, to spot when a kid needs a little more attention and work on a topic because they have to move as a group to finish all the units before a final or AP exam. Personalized education through online classes would allow for kids to finish everything before these exams but still learn the way they see best fit. 
I believe that changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a bad decision. 
The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. This process consists of 538 electors. The amount of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the President. The district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of The Electoral College. Each candidate that is running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. 
popular vote is not as efficent as eletoral votes. 
they think that if you take away this or you do that it will solve the problem. But it won't, it'll only make things worse and upset a lot of people. 
The last reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because of the disaster factor. 
I think Policy 1 would be a better policy then Policy 2 
If students were to all decide what the project was and how it should be done, then there would be a multitude of topics and confusion amongst the class. In seventh grade we were given a choice assignment to do. Although it was a fun project and allowed us to use creativity, it didn't lead us to the same information. In a summer project, the main purpose being to continue learning, a student-designed project may not be the best way to learn about a common topic. 
You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies 
Extracurricular activities should be required. 
There is one particular issue that has been boggling my brain recently. It is none other than the electoral college system. 
In Conclusion, The Electoral College should be eradicated and the popular vote should take its place. The popular vote is better because people can actually vote, the minority will have a chance, Presidents loss becasue of Electoral Vote but win the Popular vote. In the end the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. 
The summer preceding eleventh grade was by far my most memorable summer for an atypical reason - the summer assignment. This summer assignment, unlike any others, was student-designed. In the same summer I had multiple other summer assignments: annotating a textbook, completing a packet of math problems, and even writing an eight page essay! However, my wise AP Biology teacher decided to deviate from the norm by assigning a student-designed summer project. This project only had one rule: it had to relate to any part of the curriculum. To this day, I can vividly recall details about my project, its relevance to the curriculum, and the biology concepts covered throughout the project. Although many teachers around the globe have difficulties determining whether teacher created or student created summer projects are more beneficial, 
I think we should not have the electoral college. Mostly because i dont think i want to learn about swing states and run off elections and stuff. 
Although this is a great tool to use when trying to teach students it is probably very expensive to have it installed into computers for students nationwide 
(said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what he  stood for but most didn't. 
, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school. 
When there is snow in the forecast, students and teachers alike eagerly await a call from Generic_Name, the beloved public information officer for Generic_City Public Schools. Cheers are heard across the county when his voice is heard on the phone announcing that school will be closed due to the weather. Both students and teachers embrace the well-needed break, using the time off to catch up on grading, get some much needed sleep, relax, pursue hobbies, or hang out with friends. Continuing the learning process on these days off would lead to stress for unprepared teachers and sleep-deprived students. However, when snow days and other such holidays start to build up, classes may fall behind in the curriculum. This would lead to teachers rushing to cover all the material before the AP test or state-mandated final exam, and students struggling to understand the new material so quickly 
If we demolish the Electroal College then voting really wouldn't be fair. Because some states have more people than others. 
Well, I hope that I convinced you into becoming a Seagoing Cowboy like me. It's everybody's world. Let's help save the people in it. 
On May 24, 2001, about 25 years ago the NASA's viking spacecraft was circling the planet. It then spotted a human like face. It was huge! It was nearly two miles long. It looked like it had been staring back at the camera from where this picture had been taken. 
All of these will help you form a more secure, well-rounded opinion.Even still, there is no right or wrong answer to life or how to live it.However, asking for multiple opinions can, and most likely will, help you form your own opinion on life and how to deal with things.This happens by removing bias, getting down to details, and asking from multiple sides of the story, young and old.We have to ask for advise often, and getting multiple opinions is a great addition to that, that is almost always necessary.   
It's bias, because students are often with their friend group which often understand each other. On the other hand, friend groups are all different, meaning they have different beliefs and values. Another reason, the statement is bias is that students have different learning styles. A student can be a fast learner and don't need to study as hard as others students; however, another student might need more reinforcement to learn. 
Also when you have helped you should go to other places and if you see trash on the floor pick it up even if its not your's. Another thing is when people throw things on the floor tell them to pick it up and if they don t pick it up for them. 
because "each candidate has his or her own group of electors", generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws can vary that determine what or who the party consists of 
I think we should get a new system as well 
With no sports or other activities students grades could lower past a C average.Also, you must put into consideration that if the majority of students have a grade of C average.Some may not be able to improve their grades.They may already be trying as hard as they can.If so, it would become unfair for those students to not be able to participate in sports. 
I agree with the principal 
I also dont like the winner take all method of voting. When that happens its like the other peoples vote never counted. 
Taking a extracurricular activity can overload some students. 
So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. 
The Scientests have a whole process. 
The face on mars is a rock formation. No aliens made it 
You could also get a class that people could be in to do community service as a class so people could put on job applications and college applications too. 
If they we'er to ask me, I would absolutly say "Yes The Electroal College should be removed." 
The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance nthat large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportion of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida (in 2012); nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A win by the same margin in Wyoming would get the the winner only 3 electoral votes. 
I think that students should be required to do community service. 
I am writing this lettter to talk about how the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. 
Some scientist at NASA even started to believe what the people were saying 
This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still "independent voters". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones. 
The technology and cars has made the developers to invest on cars. The cars have all change time by having something in common . The cars that have been used for this technology is made by google. Google its a company that has internet wireless and its a huge company that only makes technology better. The car that has been desing has many manifactures going on . When they build a the workers they all have their positions and if i would be able to work in this car my position would be the antolock brakes. The antilock brakes prevents the driver to fall out of there is an actsident. Also in the article says that having unshape cars its bad or even if there is something weird of something new they think is bad 
The muscles in faces can really tell the actual expression of an individual or even an entire class. 
I know for a fact that when I need advice for something I ask a couple members of my family so I get more advice. Have you ever needed advice? Well if you haven't good for you, but most people need advice. 
Getting rid of the Electoral College is a better decison for the people so they get a say in how they want their county to be and not how the goverment wants the country to be. 
Many or a majority of the students would refuse to partake in this service. I doubt i would not hear complaints about this very soon. who knows what actions those who opposes being required for service would take? They might use various as well as dangerous means to let their voices be heard. 
This can be fun 
Plus, some people don't know this is going on they belive that they are voting for the person to change the state not an candaite of the president. 
There are specific steps on how this software works. 
. annother thing is that there are about 335 horses, so if you are affraid of horses then this program isn't for you. 
I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term 
A student-designed summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves 
Another reason people dont like this system is because most states have a winner takes all system where they dont spilt up the elector votes if most of the votes are for one candidate then he will get all of the votes from that state. 
You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face.You could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad. Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared.Your emotions could be all over the place.You could have certian facial expressions.For an example, you could have your fear look. You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look. The software could even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.I know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions.I personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect. 
like thousand of kids walk around school with bleh looks and they may actually be happy but just showing that expression, but the computer would read it as sad or mad. Computers are already taking over a lot of things, but when it comes to humans we should´t need a computer to tell us how were feeling. Computers and technology aren´t 100% right, only you would know exactly how your feeling. 
I understand many students are not open to this idea or don't want to work out side of school. 
The way I may see it is why spend thousands of dollars creating something the requries human skills you might as well not even make it 
They would be burried way benith the suface, becuase when Mars has a storm its vicious, and moves dust, dirt, and sediment all over. If there even was alliens they would be covered in hunderds of pounds of dust.Yet I can see the opposing side saying that since the dust moves around so much how come the bodies couldnt be revealed? This is hundreds of pounds of dust ontop of them. Even though the dust moves so much, there a 1 and a million chnace of it moving above 400 pounds of dust. 
Our nation could use Facial Action Coding system, It could better our nation a a whole, that we can dectect when a person is scared and angery, and upster. it could help, us at boarders, and when we let rugees come to our country, to see if they are actually here to be saved or here to hurt us, that way we can better as a country, and a nation 
In the famous, "Mona Lisa" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day! 
Community service is a good way for the people to get involved in the world around them 
it helps you to because you dont have to try in read there mind as a teacher the comouter can automatically tell for you 
But Venus is to deadly with acid, scortching heat, and 90 times our pressure that could crush a submarine. Also Venus has some lighting that strikes anything landing on it's surface and erupting volcanoes with frequent earthquakes. Venus also has a surface of rocky sediments with valley's, mountains, and craters under the clouds and atmosphere. 
it diminishes students' creativity, 
If people got word that were doing this good cause then the news would become an epidemic! more and more schools would start doing this making the world a better place to live in and there would be no more murder, robbery, or bullying. 
That is my argument to not be a Seagoing Cowboy.    
Summer projects purpose is to continue the growth of your mind when you are out of the classroom for about 90 days. A lot can happen to adolescents over the summer, a lot of things that anyone who is not in the same phase of life can truly understand. Many teenagers find sanity with their peers and friends in this time frame of growing up. As seen and extensively studied by Erik Erikson, Erikson came to the consensus that when you are going through the school-age stage of life you begin to pull away from your parents and adults to find yourself and find your independence. In result, you grow more drawn to your friends and peers, due to them understanding the phase of development you are going through. The connection students have with each other is something that can not be matched by teachers. No matter the background or clique a student is in they all have one major characteristic in common that connects them, they are all students. Teachers have not been in school in years and they don't connect with the same things as this generation does. Teachers did not have the same technology, pop culture, or even the same societal standards as today students have. 
you could have a really good athlete who does every sport and is a super good running back for the team, real fast and every thing. what happens if he dropped from aB average to a C average? that's what i am talking about. you can just at least say you have 2 weeks to get up your grades and if you don't then to bad so sad. if you're school is having a big dodge ball tournament after school and you have teams you play with and you have a C average then its really boring for you and your dodge ball team is one man short and they cant play because of you. 
but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. 
if as long as we don't have our cell phones out in class then we should be able to have them out during free time and lunch time 
When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector 
Extracurricular activities can be the thing that a student looks forward to doing that day, counting down the hours and minutes until school ends. They are a great place to interact with others and develop an interest or skill, where lasting friendships can be made outside of a student's normal social circles. The students have a greater control over how things are run, providing kids the chance to step into leadership roles. However, they are not for everyone. 
although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurance of a run-off election, run-off elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods. 
If your want to run for president your main goal is to get people to follow you with impression and facts 
I support It also because it never hurts to learn new things about someone or something, but I think the thing that is stopping us is the cost that it takes to send something up there and there is no point to just send someone up there to die. 
The Facial Action Coding System is a good idal for school work for if the student would get bord it could change there studing ways up or class room asiments. 
But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.   
Nevertheless, even though in paragraph 10 it says, "that that put out The maximum camera resoulution and each pixel spans 1.56 meters thats still not giving us any proof . We have been on this "Aliens Are Real" Stuff for a while now , and we dont have nothing that proves it. 
Lastly, in the story the author talks about how they can also use the new technology they made to know the emotion of drawings like Mona Lisa. 
Computers show be allowed to read the emotions of the student in from of them so that maybe the computer can help. 
I think that using the techonogy to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable 
You can make an enouncement with their parents telling the parents about the community service 
Again I think we should get rid of the Elctorial Collage vote.    
The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the " winners it take all" rule. 
The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. 
In most states it is illegal to even test the computer driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the Dristrict of Columbia have led the country in allowing the use of semi-autonomous cars. It should be illegal in most states, because it is dangerous. If one of these "smart cars"were to crash who is responsible? The driver,the car company, or the state? 
It should be our choice to do community service or not because first of all we as children or preteens shouldn't be required or forced to do those kind of things 
The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole. 
Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy has a lot of ups and downs but the ups are accually pretty cool 
aliens probably wanted it to be like that 
Lastly, many teachers prefer and advise that a course be taken online and at home due to the structure and content of the course because they believe the students will perform stronger by taking the course online. 
Source 3 attempts to discredit this claim, aguing, "Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign..." 
as many students learn better at home, outside a classroom environment, 
I think the Electoral College process is a bad idea and it should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Electoral college is unfair to voters and I think it should be gotten rid of. 
Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. Statisics show that Congress would get 34 electoral votes but they aren't really voting for the president. For Instance, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. That many voters vote on one party for president and another for Congress. 
A driverless car is safer and more efficient. 
In 2018 deaths related to cell phone use in cars accidents was 4,637 in the U.S alone. 
The " Huge Life like Rock Formation which makes it resemble an humans head and the formation given by the shadow of the rock gave the illusion of such a life like photograph of an humans eyes, nose, and the mouth." 
The other thing is they found out about venus is that " a thick atomsphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus" according to the article 
The feeling you get when you see these people's faces are priceless. It's amazing how contagious a smile is. You can not get that feeling of accomplishment... or that feeling that you actually made someone's day that much better any other way other than performing community service. Yes, it sounds like a pain. I do not know any other way to say it other than to BELIEVE ME when i say that knowing that you helped our community in a positive way is one of the greatest things ever. 
Then anyones whos not holding office can be a elector. What makes them so qualified? nothing. 
So that would cause a lot of problems in school. There could be more fights then usual. Or people could just stop caring about their grades if they cant get better then a c average trying their hardest. This problem could get you fired because it wouldn't be a good school. 
With guide lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. Let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. Students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. In a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. Having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying "Read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year" is not helpful. By giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient. 
Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. 
Second of all It looks attached to the ground. 
They say the electoral college restpres some of the weight in the political balance. 
There is no such thing as aliens. Alson there is no life of any type that can live on Mars. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform." 
'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.' 
If we did affer school actiry. We would have more time out side or inside work. That or we could all so have a day that we thust sleep then we go out side and play. one day i was so crazy because i did noting that whole day and i need some thing to do affer school. Like if i had sothing to do affer scchool a would a lot more com. 
A classroom computer could recognize when a student s becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. 
In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is. 
Heres something you might be interested in doing activities outside that you may have never wanted to do before. 
the auther is sau that ( In space term- human have seat numerous of spacecraft to land on this clound-draped world. Each pervies mission was unmanned, and for good reason, sice no spacraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. May that is the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three deacades) say the auther in the artivcle. 
I think if were allowed some leeway than we will be happy with our teachers so we can actually work on our work 
Although in 2000 the Electoral College vote happened 
Cell phone companies such as AT&T realized how big cell phones are distractions to drivers so they come up with programs. For example, a big program today is " It could wait ". On the site www.independentmotors.com it describes the can wait program. It quotes "AT&T itself has helped drive these conversations with its It Can Wait campaign, which has seen more than 7 million people take the campaign's pledge to drive more safely. The company also launched its DriveMode app, which keeps all phone calls and texts quiet while you are driving. The app turns on automatically when it detects that the user is moving faster than 15 MPH and turns off shortly after it detects that the user has stopped." 
I think that the researchers shouldn't be having to look seversl times just to prove certain people wrong. If they don't believe then they need to go to Mars for themselves. It'd great that they got the comparsion but they went through trouble to get there. It was not an easy target. In face, it's hard work. 
No they should not use the technology in class rooms because thats a invashion of pricicy. 
productivity. 
they will be more informed on the possible solutions to their issue, 
Another thing being, if they're at home they will focus much better unlike school 
The Electoral College avoids run off elections unlike the popular vote system. 
Please pick policy 1 cause kids won't have to sneak phones to lunch in the morning or in class you would be doing all of us a favor. Also maybe they would pay more attention in class just maybe. It would be good for the school, for the district and for the students. 
Albert Einstein is known as one of the smartest people in the world. He created a robot, Frankenstein. Einstein blocked out others, used his own knowledge, got creative, and made history on his own. Helen Keller was born with the default of not being able to hear or to see. This was a tragedy, making it hard for Keller to walk and successfully know where she was going. Growing up with this issue she became extremely smart and used her problem, got creative, and began helping others by tutoring people who are deaf and blind. If students created their own projects it would give them an opportunity to come up with something incredible using what they, causing them to be creative, and generate ideas 
,tools from school that you may need, 
With the teacher designing the project, they could make a clear and distinct rubric. This would inform students exactly what the teacher is looking for. It is very difficult to complete a project when you are not sure how it will be graded. Teachers would be able to help students and answer any questions they may have. For example, over the summer, Generic_Name has an assignment to research her favorite U.S. president and write a paper on their life. The teacher provides an over view of the assignment, a list of all the requirements, and a rubric. Generic_Name would like to add a page on the president's children. However, she is not sure if that is allowed, considering that the assignment was only on the president himself. She sends an email to her teacher and asks her question. The teacher is able to answer her question almost immediately, because the teacher knows exactly what they want. The teachers should formulate the projects, so they can assist the students and guide them. 
if many people pick one president and the other only gets a couple the one with the most should win because the peoples voice should choose who is over them. 
Attending classes in school gives students chances to better learn about themselves by providing classes in the arts, technology, cooking, management, and much more 
Extracurricular activities are powerful learning tools because students are learning while having fun. 
Or they cant do any sport or activity because they cant afford it these are some tough times 
," as stated in the articelWhat is the Electoral College? by The Office of Federal Register . Which makes the Electoral a great part of doing the highst or popular vote of President. Not only that but"each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors." which helps them amd still be equal enough to the other runing President. In the articleThe Indefensible Electoral Colloege: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong it says in the bottem of the fist paragraph "This year voters can expect another close election in which popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders." which is saying that most Americans prefre to have this electoral college for popular votes. 
We have tried to explore Venus multiple times but the explorations have been un named because after a few our the spacecrafts broke or quit on us. We think that this is because of Venuses harsh envirnement constisting of acid rain and clouds, the hottest surface temprature in our Milky Way, and the fact that it is so hard to catch the planet when it is close to our planet. "Also notteble Venus has the hottest surface temprature of any planet in the solar system, even though mercury is the closest to the Sun". Thats a reason why we cant land and stay there 
In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can. So students can learn and be successful n the future. Remembering that the one that are students right now, are the future of the world 
To finish up my dissagrement of why someone like me or even you shouldent do this is, did he even help anybody becaue in the promt it didn't tell wither or not if he did. I would think that was that was the most important thing.            
On the other hand another reason why people are scared to show their emotions and feelings is because the care about what other people think about them 
students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs 
but, thats not logical. 
students should take classes in school 
Automated driving is projected to be driven by the technology that it is equipped with most of the time. 
When it is time to elect a new president, citizens want to know thier votes help elect the President of thier choice. 
However, if students are allowed to pursue their interests, they will be motivated to do their projects. 
I think you should go with policy 1. 
Policy one seems fair enough for everyone 
I belive the advantages of limitng a car usage. 
The electoral college is a process not a place 
Given these details, he uses useful information that we need to know. In the first paragraph he describes what Venus actually is. If he wasn't to do that, people might be misleaded and still assume that Venus could perhaps be a star. The author gives very useful information to describe what Venus is. 
others are fine with working by themselves in a quiet area. 
Its important to try keeping stress and anxiety the farthest away from students to help them stay focused in school and become successful. 
In the passage they gave an example of a real face painted of "Mona Lisa" becuase in the picture she has a stright face and she shows "no emotion". But it is also made to put a smile on your face.The computer model of the face technology has to have a 3D face model and has to have "all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles". Humans "preform the same impressive calcualtion everday". everybody had diferent facal expressions. 
Why is venus called the evening star? Well it is as know as that because it is one of the brightest points of light. 
Hook: Talking to more than one person when seeking advice is a better choiceBridge: seeking more than one persons advice helps you get ideas 
Everbodys ansewer is different but my ansewer is to abolish it 
I for one am very against this upcoming decision. 
To top it off, people are just so wooed by the canditate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. 
A third detial, that the author gave us information about the text was that not even a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. 
On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform 
All in all, this new technology is very valuable in a classroom. It would durrastically change how kids learn and would make them way more interested than they currently are. Most kids do not learn the same, this technology could change that so each student can learn the way that best helps them. This application will help out teachers tremendously and could really improve passing rates! 
do not add anything new to our requirements for school, we have enough stuff to do and we don't need to come to school back to back exhausted from doing sports, chores, work, and school work. It is just unnecessary. 
Even with small objects you would still be able to clearly see if the object is a landform or a alien life form. The natural landform is equivalent to a butte or mesa. The "face" on Mars is still a like to a normal landform on Earth. 
Anothor thing about the computor for the students can read the student's emotions. 
The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
First of all i am against using this technology because, In the passage it says Faces dont lie and it can tell when someone is inmatating a fake smile and i dont really think that is true sometimes faces do lie. 
The students could think of projects to not only work their minds while on break 
Although it's pretty clear that Generic_Name's rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, "The pursuit of happiness" 
In the text ''The indefensible electoral college why even the best-laid defense of the systeme are wrong.''the quote explains that even though both systems of voting work,popular vote is the more dominant rule. 
Have you ever asked someone for advice? If yes, then you know it can be a good thing. Asking for advice means to get other people's take on different options and seeing others choices. For example, teenagers ask for advice on their Instagram photos and their outfits all of the time. It helps them decide what they want to post or wear. Also, just know that there are no strict rules on how or what to ask advice for either, it is a very casual thing 
It's also we don't payAttention that's why we have the highest rate in Georgia. 
also some parents might want them to have the phones with them in case of an emergency. 
When learning about a new subject it is better if someone is there to help you, instead of jumping into a project. Then you have to do a lot more research and it may not all be correct, and you wont be able to tell because this is your first time learning about the topic. If a teacher was there help guide you through the project it will make the research easier and more reliable. Another benefit is that Students will focus more on the learning part of the project more because they dont have to make their own with the little to no information they know about the topic. I feel the like a whole student- designed project is too stressful for them to do in the summer, because they lack the knowledge and discipline, so if it was teacher orientated it is a guarantee that the students will learn the correct criteria. A teacher- designed project is more beneficial to the kids rather than a student- designed. 
Students who have obstacles such as mental health issues or the lack of local education would greatly benefit and be better accommodated from the opportunity to take classes online and from their home. 
let them express their creativity. 
This mechanism is able to determine the emotions of a student and see if they need help or not. 
If there was someone that did not have one of these cars they would be at a higher risk of someone wrecking. 
These are plenty of reasons why I think that you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. There are also reasons why I became a Seagoing Cowboy and what you need to know to be one. Please take my advice and try out the program. I think you will love being able to see cool stuff in different countries and working with the animals. Do not forget to be ready for anything that comes your way while you are on that boat. 
This would be a good thing because if the school is close together then their wont be as many fights. 
Many teachers would argue that the creation of student-designed projects would be unimportant to the curriculum, as they don't truly focus on something that needs to be taught. However, the importance of student-designed projects is to encourage them to be creative and to not be stuck in the mindset of just passing the class, instead opening their eyes to new ideas and allowing them to think outside the box. 
Using this to help the teacher is alright. 
first of all,even though the electoral collage consists of 538 electors 
In conclusion, seeking multiple people's opinions is more beneficial than only seeking one. You can face the situation knowing you did the best you could to prepare for it. Next time you you resort to only asking one person for advice, think twice because it will be helpful to talk to people who have experienced your situation, you will have more ways to overcome an unexpected challenge, and you can let all of your emotions out to everyone.   
or you can talk to the principal and try to change his mind and get people to play, or you can talk to the teachers and get them to change his mind 
For all we know it could just be a mountain that has ''eyes'', ''a mouth'', ''and a nose'' due to shadowing. 
I think that driverless cars are a good idea in theory, but in practice they seem impracticle, costly, and unsafe. 
What dies that mean?It means that they wont gave you bad advice.they will tell you what to do bast on their own experts. 
For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle. 
The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. 
In paragraph 2 scientists firgured it was just another martian mesa, which they state is common around cydonia. Another detail from paragraph 2 they state only because it had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh. 
Schools should have the option of attending the classes through online means because the student may not be comfortable around their classmates. 
Receiving help from professionals doesn't necessarily mean that they know what's best for someone, but they can certainly serve as assistance if someone is facing a problem. For instance, a couple of months ago, my friend Generic_Name was struggling with drafting her college resume. She was at a disadvantage because she didn't know what steps to follow to write her resume, and the worst part of it all was that her school guidance counselor was unwilling to take the time to help her. At first, she attempted to write it herself without any guidance, but then her old friend, Generic_Name, who already graduated from college and is now an English professor at Generic_School, was visiting during that week. He noticed how frustrated she was with her essay, and decided to sit down with her and give her some pointers. After finalizing her resume to the best of her ability, Generic_Name decided to make a copy of it to give to her English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, who is a notable alum from Harvard University. Ms. Generic_Name gave her some feedback, but overall, her paper was ready to submit. Generic_Name sent it out to Santa Monica University, and received her acceptance letter a few months later. 
Also it resembles Earth so much that we want to know more about its geogrpahy. In general we want to know more about this planet and get up close to it and observe it directly instead of from a far. We also want to know what gases there are and so maybe we could build something that wouldn't melt when it lands. This is how human curtiosity plays a role in discovering Venus. 
With popular vote it is not certain what can happen. 
the reason being is, while students are doing an activity they are going to feel motivated to win or have their team win. Another reason is students will start to do things more organized or on time the reason being is, now that they have some motivation from doing an activity when it comes to doing this they are supposed to do, they might do it better. The final reason is students who don't have respect can most likely gain it the reason being is, when being motivated your behavior changes really quickly, so people who have no respect might gain it. 
Technology make the lives easier of millions of people.It makes communication easier and more convenient.People all over the world want to integrate technology into as many aspects of their lives as possible.Schools are jump on this bandwagon by integrating online distance learning and video conferencing into their curriculum.Some educators find this would enhance the education of students, because they can learn during most any circumstances, but some believe this would be much more challenging and inconvenient because of internet issues and the situation of students when are are absent from school. 
their resources will be known. 
The last reason why students won't benefit from online schooling is students choosing not to do it. 
For instants in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," in paragraph 5 it states that "evidence that NASA would rather hide." 
To begin, the winner-take-all system is very unfair to the voters. 
That is the reasoning behind the fact that I agree with both sides here 
If everyone just did one community service this world would be a step closer to being a lot better. Each year goes by and the world gets worse for the animals in nature and for us 
Way dies it help to ask for multiple opinions it will let you see what they would do, 
The forth reason we should have a club is that if you want children to learn and if they don't know how to do something then students could tutor them and they will learn and be better at it. 
There are three ways NASA has been try to beat Venus challenges. We have yet to try them on Venus. If one of this ways works we have the satitfation of completing the challenge Venus gave us. 
because most student have phones anyways during the day an this way there would be less trouble less sneaking texting in class less parents getting angry less problems. 
As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation. Friends, family, associates and the others in your life all have access to the information you need to make the best decision for yourself. When dealing with conflict, it would be most beneficial to use their knowledge to prevent your problems from troubling you intensely.        
In conclusion, the arguement is still ongoing, and doesn't seem to have a clear answer. I believe the stasis lies between finding a need for going to Venus, that isn't just the need for exploration, and a proven safe way to get and stay on Venus. The two perspectives are the author and the people opposing the author. The two issues are is there a need for exploaration and the safety of going to Venus. Therefore, with all the evidence provided to you, you can make a clear decision about if you want NASA going to Venus, or if you want NASA to stay grounded, but the author believes that you should side with him in support of Venus exploration. 
It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College dosent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a canidate. 
I personally think that we should not have the Electoral College , because the citizens should be allowe to pick our president and vice prsident. It should be up to the people not the congress. 
The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. "The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed. 
To elaborate, some students find it hard to work in a school environment due to various issues such as, anxiety, depression, etc. If they were able to attend classes in their homes, they would be able to work better since they would be in a place that is known well by them. While this may not account for a majority of students, the system of attending classes from home would greatly benefit the students that have a hard time learning at schools. 
The Electoral College is something that should be kept for our government voting system. 
The driver that was distracted by texting can also put his or her passengers lives at risk. 
It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future. 
Thats too much voting going on for no reason 
but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues. 
Teachers are with their students the whole year so their most likely to know what each student struggles on, it may not be the whole class that struggles on one topic but the point of the project is to go over certain topics so you won't forget them. The main reason students take test are to see what they struggle on or lack knowledge in and with the teacher designing the project it will focus mainly on those topics. If the students were to design the project they could focus to much on one topic or may not include the most needed topic at all. For example, if it were a math project the student could struggle with their multiplication tables but have more knowledge on everything else, the student could forget to include the multiplication tables or they could just focus lightly on the topic they really need. Teachers could include a guide or some helpful tips to make sure that everything that is to be known about that concept will be there. Students could have payed attention to the topic but still couldn't comprehend it, the teacher could know some tips and tricks to help make it easier for a struggling student. Including helpful tips could also make it easier for the students who have learning disabilities. 
I believe these summer projects should be student-designed and not teachers 
Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea 
However; the people should have the right to directly choose the candidate of his or her choice. Therefore, the elecoral college is outdated and must be eliminated. 
Dear state senator, I am against the decison to keep theElectoral College 
The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy 
For example in the article Does the Electoral College Work it says that the Electoral College votes by people who are profetionals and popular vote is by the people of the United States of America. This quote explains how the popular vote is better because it is decided by the people not the government. 
My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters 
The advantages to this is that if people don't drive that much anymore the pollution can be stopped at a certain point and cause no harm anymore of course the air might still be polluted but with a less perentage. People would definitely use money on something else thtne to try and get the new car or just use it on gas. There are alternatives to limit the use of cars.Sociolagists believe if this continues with people limiting car transportation that "it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants." so if we all got to think about it we are basically doing a favor to oursleves by helpiing the planet by limiting the use of cars. 
It would be hard but we could do it, but it will affect the way people live greatly. 
if you do you get to help people and help animals. 
However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. 
or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. cell phones are okay 
Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself. 
The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifed citizens." This means that the people of the state can vote buts it really not going to count. These people want a good president and it happened in 2012. Alot of Southern states like Mitt Romney and they voted for him. He got alot of votes and was beating Obama. But Obama got"61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentpf the votes for Romney." Romney had change in his eyes and the Electoral College didnt care and took that away from him. 
Making suburbs much more compact then they are right now will lead to less car usage. 
Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's 
So I think that people should stop driving so reckless and start paying attention to the road 
In 1976 are satilite the viking 1 was orbiting mars and takeing pictures of the planet. When we looked at them we noticed this one. A picture of a face on mars. When we noticed it eas just a mesa in the face. 
The second reason I have to share is that it is an illusion 
Although many people think that the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. 
Protective parents may require their children to call or text them during break time to let them know they're doing okay. 
People should consider certain things before picking up a phone. Things can be done to lower the accidents caused by the distraction of a cell phone. Companies have taken a huge step to decrease the number of wrecks caused by phones. 
In the artical David Gold berg said that "All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik abou 
All these fumes are not good for the planet we live on and deffintley not good for us human beings. In source 2 it says how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from all the gases in the air from moter vehicles. You know how much fumes would have to be in the air for them to make a driving ban? I mean if thats not putting up a red flag i don't know what would. We only have one place to live right now and its our jobs to keep it clean and protect it. 
In the passage in paragraph three it says ¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it 
In addition attending online classes could help students with social differences. 
So if you pick a canidate and he is not what the people what he may be planning to blow up the world . The citizens of the United States know what they wan in a leader and they know what they look forward to in the future . By letting congress select our president your not letting us speak for our self and that is wrong .According to paragraph fifteen of source three ,Electoral College  is widely regarded as an Anachronism and needs to bee overruled which i strongly agree with . Also in paragraph sixteen of source three, it states that citizens choose their representative and they trust them to pick the right person but that trust is often betrayed , So why would you keep having this election ? 
different sets of advice can also bring you to the best possibly out come. Creating a more logical and better choice to make. 
One of the largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get their children away from the computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened the need for toys and books, since children entertain themselves with games on their tablets or books they download also on the tablet. But cars play a big part in this. When a person first gets a car, he/she feels free. You feel like the world is yours because you can go anywhere. But the problem is that people become less social with cars. Instead of going to play a sport with some friends, most people would rather drive somewhere else. It is also the reason the United States is ranked second in country with the most overweight people, vehicles are so unexpensive here that anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to their destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks" (Selsky 28). This also shows the improvement on the cities' sidewalks and the increase of people attending parks. Without cars, the streets look better and people recieve more exercise. 
To be in the militalry , you have to be very courages and very brave . If you think about it it's really worth it because you are saving lives and thats why most people do it , to help people and to save lives . I think personally that it's worth it I would love to save someones life and do a very courages deed like that , it takes guts . 
The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. 
The first reason that was broguht upon my eyes was in paragraph eight where it states, "~but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors." 
"It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."  Also, in 1976 if a mere 5,559 voter in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii would have voted differently it would have been a tie.  That would have been a catastrophe.In 960 segregationist almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with electors who would haved picked John F. Kennedy's opponent.  Also, during the 1960's in Hawaii Vice President Richard Nixon had been presiding over the senate, validating only his opponent's electors. Although, he had done so without creating a precedent.The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of selecting a President.  The five reasons we have retained the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree.  All are practical reasons not conservative and non-liberal reasons.  With other things being equal other things are not.  Also, larger states will get more political attention from presidental candidates in a campaign verse a smaller state.                                                                     
one reason i think that the face is just natural landform 
In addition, some may argue that the Electoral College is risky and a representative may not always stay true to their word, but isn't this the case with all types of voting? 
InGerman Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is claimed that in VAUBAN, Germany, residents have given up their use of cars."All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have no change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. 
sometimes, others simply lack honesty. 
In conclusion, we are not terribly far from cars driving themselves. It is more a safety and trust concern rather than the technology being there. Cars will drive themselves more and more but with the aid of the driver always being there and capable of taking over at any time. But does this make them self-driving if the driver must be present and paying attention at all times? Why not keep their attention by just letting the driver, you know, DRIVE? 
Imagine a point in time in the future where there could be driverless and flying cars. People have always for a long time thought that this could maybe never be possible. Google cofounder Sergey Brin begs to differ. He believes that their may be a start towards driverless cars.Sergey Brin imagines a future where numerous amounts of driverless car could form a public-transport taxi system. He believes that this could one day become a reality. Driverless car production should still continue over the next several years. Although driverless cars have drove over 500 miles without crashing, there are still setbacks. Driverless car would still have to alert the driver while backing out of driveways and navigating themselves through road issues such at construction zones and accidents with other drivers. Driverless car so far can drive, turn, and brake, but there are still somethings that the driver would still have to do.Although the production of driverless cars is still just underway, there is still much more to be done. In the future, driverless cars may be available to everyone someday. There is still a long way to go, but we are getting closer to achieving this everyday.       
it can influence your decision 
A teacher-designed summer project does not allow for the same amount of individualism that could stem from a project designed by a student. 
Things like creating rules to attend the needs of all citizens and create equality amongst them, to keeping harm from out of reach, the Electoral College should become much more wiser in choosing the right ruler to take control. 
it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home. 
As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. " Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1)," this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people. 
last but not lest a rock could of den formed or a medeor crash thes are some of the things why i think it could not be aliens.            
but shouldn't be required at least you should wait until the kids are a senior in H.S. to start require community service. 
Thats what the text said and we dont want that. Us the people want to vote for who we want to. This will be something big if we can keep this thing going.  
cause it helps people get into a college that they would like to get into or want to it can make them happy and then later on in life they can make better choices to live free and get god jobs and have anice apartyment and other things of that sort much it is for the. 
For example, two schools in an area have their 8th grade students do at least an hour of community service a day. Eventually, people would forget how nice it is because it would become a usual thing around the town. This shows that if everyone in 8th grade performed community service daily, or even weekly, citizens would view it as the students doing what they need to do, rather than how nice those students are. 
Some students may find the project uninteresting and because of this, they may not learn the helpful information needed to help them with their classes. 
it keeps things in order 
, Mona Lisa has 83% of happiness 9% disgust 6% fearful and 2% ssanger. According to some new computer software that can reconize emotion the sofware is the latest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the unversity of amsterdam. The process begins when the computar constructs a 3-D computar model of the face: All 44 mayjor muscles in the model must move like human muscles movement of one or more muscles in the model is called an "action unit" then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscle 
The most recent image taken of the "Face on Mars" in 2001 looks very different from the original image taken in 1976. If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it. The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object. 
I know this because in the text it says "NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus." In the article it also says "referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." 
Thirdly, the Electoral college influences countries to not participate in the privilege of voting. 
still has features like the earth 
When comparing distance learning and in-class learning, it is evident that students would benefit much more from being in a classroom setting than from learning in the comfort of their own homes. Not only do online classes and video conferences lack the ability for students to gain any sort of social skills, but they also lack the ability to teach students how to cooperate with one another, which is an important skill that students must acquire to survive the real world. In addition, in-class learning allows for students to ask for help when needed. It is because of this that students would not benefit from attending classes at home. 
Last But Not Least, The electoral votes given to each state sucks. 
The U.S is supposably a free country , everyone has a right to vote , and freedom of speech ; if congress decides to not do electoral college , then it wouldnt be fair to citizens 
It, as the article talks about, can help students if there getting lost or bored. By just adjusting it's teaching algorythms to better help the student. 
like back in 1960, in Louisiana legislatture nearly succeeded in replacing Domocratic electors with new electors who oppose Jonh F. Kennedy so the the popular would not have gone to him. 
Everyone else had given up becasue they were upset because they felt as if they let people down. So I decided to go back one more time, and i found what we all were looking for!          
These are a few reasons why you shouldn't tell kids they can't play sports if they a grade C average. Think these reasons over and thank you for the time being that you read this letter. 
To reduce the pollution of the chemicals that cars make is to simply show citizens the advantages of limiting car usages. 
Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.My position on this issue, 
The challenge of Venus. Venus is sometimes called the evening star why because it's one of the brightest points of light in the night time. The nickname evening star is misleading because Venus is planet its the secound planet of the sun 
by, first making the student get lower grades, because they have to split their focus to two things at once therefore making the student worried about if he or she will pass the year. Second can make the students upset, by making the student do more work then they need. Third it can drive the students insane, by making the students do way too much school work. Those were some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. 
venus has value not only beacuse its insight to be gained on the planet by itself humans will be curious enough to go check out venus 
china and i got to see the Panama Canal,all and all it's just a realy good experience and you would like it if you are an outgoing person. 
that I made a great decision In my life. 
the second thing is that venus might have new creature that we never seen before that can with stand the conditions that venus has. The third thing is that venus never ben explord before so we might see thing we might not have seen on earth. 
I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. 
The decision weather to enforce all student to do community service is a fabulous idea. 
Car-free cities seem to be more safe. 
the computer can recognize the subtle facial movments we human's have to express hoe we feel. 
This article is about a small town near the french and swiss borders its name is Vauban. Vauban ha a unique community they have no cars!. yeah thats right no cars there is a no automobile law in this small town which makes a lot of people like the mother of two ms. Heidrun walter. she says that she is "much happier this way because when i had a car i was always tense" 
People are very subjective to bias, it happens to all of us, whether we want it to or not. 
Having Facial Action Coding System in the school, would be kinda great 
kids are already stressed enough with their school work and other things, 
We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet? 
One way is to have your phone out of reach and on silent so if you get a message or a call you won't be able to get tempted to reach for your phone. Another way is to use an app to block incoming texts or calls. Some apps can send an auto response back, letting the sender know that you are driving and will respond when you are not driving. And one way is to be committed to not texting and driving. 
due to mental illnesses preventing a person from attending, 
Even if a person is faced with an easy decision like choosing an outfit, sometimes they might just want a little help deciding. It is always good to make the best decision possible and asking multiple people can help people make decisions. 
Knowing that Venus is a whole planet the size of earth and only getting to see just a tiny bit of it is like starting at one side of the United States and then driving only a few hours to see how far you get, If you are trying to go all the way around the world to get back to the same spot but only have a few hours to do so, you don't cover much of anything to have any real say of how the world looks in different areas if you haven't seen it all yet. 
Their job as a teacher is to inform you about the information your presented with, and be able explain it to you the best way possible. Therefore, you can retain it and be able to apply it when it comes into play. I was in my 7th grade science class on a Monday. The week before I took a test on the biology of a spider. I didn't learn anything about it because I was sick and wasn't present in the class for the lesson and instruction given by my teacher. I missed a whole week and in the week my teacher gave out ways to help remember the information about the spiders life. I struggled so much on the test and didn't perform well. My teacher gave me the opportunity to retake it. I stayed after school and took notes while she presented me with details and ways to remember the steps of the spiders biology. That night I went home and re wrote my notes out until I can remember all the information she taught me. I took the test. Later, I found out I scored perfect on it. Im a visual learner and have to be present in class to be able to comprehend what I learn. I have to write everything down or drawl it out so my brain will be able to remember the information. If I don't remember the information on a specific test I have coming up, I can go back into my notes I wrote and re-write it out so I see the words again and again which helps my brain remember it better. 
So would you rather be a person that only ask one person for an opinion or ask multiple people, but seeking multiple people opinions is better because seeking multiple opinions can help 
it would show more creative projects, 
The last thing about the computor for the students is that they can be a reowned drama coach. 
students wont be as motivated if they themselves didn't design it 
With all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars. Becuase of all of these problems that arise with the cars it is just a gargantuan risk to implement these cars into our lifestyles. 
I feel like people think it good to have for them self i feel like we should get it because a lot of human perform this impressive "calclulation" everyday because you can probably tell how friend is feeling simply by look on her face. 
I think that students should do community service 
An example would be, "Often reffered to as "Earth's Twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too." 
Fourth, another evidence that i can use that supports why i am for this the quote "The software is the latest innovtion from " just from this quote i can support why i am foe the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions 
Ever thought of a car that drives itself? Seems pretty crazy right? Its been shown in movies and televison and it seems pretty impossible. In reality, people are actually trying to make it happen, there has been proto types of cars that are mostly driveless and testing of many kinds. Whether it happens or not, theres a weighing question of is it a good idea? 
If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride. 
The author talks about NASA'S possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus . 
As "Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution," people wanted/ thought it would be fair to count the District of Columbia as a "state." So people took a vote to make the change, thats why it is the the 23rd Amendment. When the USA gets more population, for a short time, there will be a odd amount of electoral votes, that means no ties. Until the popluation grows or decreases enough to make a even number of votes again. 
Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either. 
Allowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity 
According to paragraph 1 it says " The Electoral College is a Process not a place the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens." So when you hear that it's not a place and its a process yay! we're learning 
I think that community service is very important 
you can tell when someone is truly smiling because there muscles in there face move a serten way and if it is a fake smile your muscles move a different way therefore you can tell if the smile is fake or not. 
it could help you explore different mindsets, 
but to be honets isn't better to have people like our electors to pick for us some one who really know about politics and about all of it. We all would be in better hands. 
Lukes point of vew is that Luke is trying to get people to partisapatein the seagoing cowboys program 
I came here to try to explain how much I loved this trip. It prepared me for life. I hope you will join and become a Seagoing Cowboy. The phone number is below(555) 444-7774     
to ensure that students are truly challenging themselves, 
Over the years many schools have assigned summer projects as a way to help keep students minds active while on break. These projects can include reflection essays, construction, reading catalogs, and many other wonderful things. At the moment many of these projects are designed by the teachers, however many schools are considering switching to projects designed by the students. 
People who do community service enjoy and want to help the community, if they are forced to do community service, they would not perform to the best of their abilities and waste their time. This would not be best for the schools and the community. 
The use of tecnology reading your face is a bad idale for some things but not all things. Emotions are what humans have. The Facial coding system enables computer to read face exspreshions like happy ,sad,frown,fear,disgust,anger,and suprise 
It would be wonderful not having to worry about danger or ozone being depleted. Knowing that a energy souce would always be around would be nice too. Everyone could agree that this is a glorious idea and the turn of a new leaf, the start of a new world. A more safe and stable world. So keep them in the garage and grab that bike you bought three years ago. Start peddling. 
I am with the idea of the FACS becaues it seems vary interesting. 
Student-designed projects allow students to show their full potential through creativity. 
Every student matters and can make a difference. A good way to be involved at school is to join an extracurricular activity. For example, if someone joined the SCA then they would be involved by organizing school dances and events. Giving ideas to the student council is another way to be a part of your school. Say you thought that the dress code needed to be adjusted, you could join a club and talk about it. These clubs can be used to spread awareness for bullying. Someone could of been bullied and they want to feel part of something so they join a club for bullying awareness. Students should encourage others to be part of something at their school. There are numerous ways to be involved at your school, all you need to do is put yourself out there. 
it allows people to understand where you're coming from. 
At some point a studnets can feel pressered after a class of even before there next class. These emotion have the accursy to not be the same during a students day. Calculating these emotion, can not be like working on a math problem. Emotions can change in the matter of a second. You just dont know what can happen at any minute that changes your expressions. 
While home school give students the opportunity to work at their own pace and complete assignments with their best effort, regular school however provides tools to do the same thing (after school, study hall, and teacher assistance). 
So let get out and do the work and leave the world the cleanest posable cause i know that we can we have done better thing before. 
But thats were you would be wrong. 
In my oppinion this is not made by aliens. 
The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change. 
Over the summer you can forget things and having a teacher- designed project can help remember. 
please go find a passion because you cant keep doing this and wasting your life away. Go water some plants, and make your bed, or make another persons bed. Just do somethign else other that sit here and read a bunch of essays that a essentially meaning less. You need something more in life and i do as well 
France has been a major component to this harmful gas, as explained by Robert Duffer in the passageParis bans driving due to smog"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..." In addition, Duffer continues to provide evidence to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing "[Last] week Paris had 147 miocrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London," By including this simple sentence, we are fully aware of just how much harm pollution has done to the environment due to car uage in Paris. Moreover, the smog in Paris was so intense that "Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Although almost 4,000 drivers were fined, the smog had cleared enough by Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. 
Waking up early for school is already a hassle for many students and being sick, while having to wake up early could make the student have a much harder time. All a student wants to do is lay in bed and get better soon, but a lot of students often worry about all the work that will be piled up on them once they return to school, making them force themselves to attend. If students do this, it can lead to even worse issues, such as having an unwanted accident at school or even spreading the sickness to multiple other students. Video conferencing can help students stay on track with their work and also help them have better access to their medication when it needs to be taken. Students would not have to deal with unneeded stress from school and could calmly focus their energy on bettering their health. 
However, other people who participate in extracurricular activities get their work done on time which means that there are ways to do so. 
Electoral college is the best way to go beacuse like that will only have one slate of electors. But if the popular vote then most likely will end up with two or more slates of electors and personlitly I wouldnt like that 
By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. 
There are advantages of limiting car usage, but not as much as you thought. 
With social skills, resources, and good relationships, students are more likely to achieve their goals. Being without these things, long distance learning students are set behind for the outside world. Therefore, all students should attend school the traditional way to obtain all the benefits and opportunities to be as successful as they can.  
by lowering their stress levels while letting them become more comfortable in their own work environment. 
It is true that if you change it by popular vote for the president many people is going to like it beacuse they just trust in the suposely best president 
If oneday we adapt the popular vote the of this nation would be so satisfied with their vote because your is worth more in a sence. 
"..the electoral college is unfair to voters." All the people want is to be equal and have their rights and in order for them to have rights. Instead, of Congress going with just the populars, they should be able to count up all the people's voting choices and let it decide like that. "The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe." If the higher people in the Presidency don't take charge soon enough every electoral poll booth we have will turn into a big mess with horrible, unexpected things coming. 
The choice you make can effect anyone in a positive way, because you were aware of everyone's opinions. That's why you should ask for an opinion(s) for the choices. You might know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. 
A C is still a passing grade, and even a D is a passing grade. 
It can be riducolusly dangorous and will kill anyone that steps foot on venus 
I think that the Electoral College should be abolished and to elect a president by popular vote. 
Choosing a president should be elected by the popular vote of people not electors. 
A grade B average is enough because it's not too low and you're making good grades and such. 
I think that the schools have good idea for the students for them is better because study more in at home, and also is interesting that each student have time for study in home the reasons is because this can to be benefit for the student. I think for some student is more easy take the class for online, but also if the schools have the opportunity about how the student can study in their home. Also because some student don't like coming in schools and for they is easy study in home, maybe they have more time for make homework, and for me is very important because the student is learning more. 
These driverless cars should be concidered hilgly dangerous to humans for they will never have the power to oberate just as a human could. 
It is the morning after the election, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and you are joyful as can be, Why?  Last night's vote showed that your president that you wanted to win was going to be the next President of the United States of America.  You go to your laptop, open the screen, and there, in bold letters it says that the candidate you did not want to win was sitting there in the Oval Office.  You are in shock. Your friends call you and ask you what happened. Did something go wrong? Did we miss any extra votes last night?  You go look at the votes, they are still the same.  Then you relize that the Electoral College did not care what the people of this country said. The Electoral College did not care in one candidate had 100,000 more votes than the other.  All they wanted is everything to go their way. 
Asking people for advice is very important, because hearing other viewpoints can give us a new way of thinking about the decision we have to make. The next time you have to make an important choice, try asking people you trust for advice. 
People often overlook important details while creating an idea or making a choice, but when they ask for advice the people they ask can help them identify their flaw. For example, when people are planning a party they might forget to choose the kind of cake they are going to buy. When they ask a peer for advice their peer can point out their mistake, or the person planning the party will talk through their plan with the individual they asked for advice from and realize their flaw. Many mistakes will be avoided by people seeking for advice. 
I'm writing you this letter to discuss that we should keep the Electoral College. 
When students are at school, they tend to have a schedule and they're told exactly what to do and when to do it. From personal experience, I've learned that most students don't enjoy being forced to do something. Being told what to do and when to do it, makes the learning environment more stressful for students. Therefore, the more freedom students have the less stress they'll receive. At school, students have some unreasonable consequences. If students did online learning, they would benefit from not having as many consequences. Student would benefit from having less consequences. Therefore, students should have the right to their freedom, especially when it comes to what they're learning. 
Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowboy he loves all the sights, all the help that he can give to these other people, and that he could have this opportunity in life.       
The citizens of the United States sould be able to vote for who we want our candidate's electors to be. This is because if something goes wrong we will have the right to change the electors and be happy about who they are going to be. We cant do that with Electoral Voting. 
You should at least make some sort of suit that is safe for acid to hit it and so it doesn't melt your suit. It will be pretty cool to finally go to other planets and explore them. 
If the enforcer of this project wrote a rigid outline describing exactly what a learner must write about, the report could very plausibly be submitted as a mindless paper with no true interest taken in it. The individual could provide exactly what the teacher asks for, no more, no less. One may even be rewarded for this work since they did all that was asked of them. 
Lastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. Any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability. The Alcohol Rehab Guide claimed that, you'll have a "slow reaction time, lack of coordination, reduce concentration, decrease vision, and inhibit judgment." These are ways alcohol influences you, and your driving capabilities. 
Having a popular vote is the same thing but with more people and more accurate. 
you get to help hungry soldiers thatare helping our country. 
it is a process made by our founding fathers and it is established in the constitution. It is a compromise between the election of the president and the vote of the citizens and a vote of Congress. The Electoral College process is long it consists of many sections like the electors, meeting the electors so they can vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting the votes everyone thata voted. The Electoral College comsist of 538 vots but thwey only need 270 votes in order to elect a President. With that amount of votes they can become presidents 
Book work has dated back decades, Its time to modernize and find different ways to learn.While for decades teachers have been prescribing projects that are an inch thick in paper, we have been struggling, we need change now; Change is good and needed change is how we industrialized and now change will be how we do our tests, papers, essays & projects. We should be able to choose what subject a paper is on and how should it be done, because in all honesty we are the future so we need to work on certain matters, problems & accessions towards our future like emissions, pollution & much much more. 
veryone will be given the same amount of knowledge about the campaigns. 
It states that keeping the electoral college is a more promising way to vote for the president of the united states 
They shed have your best intros in mind. 
get ready for high school, 
This helps them to have a "C" or higher and they can apply what they learn on the field to when they'er off the field. A student in my class is always asking for his absent work because he has to leave early for one of his games. This student doesn't play just one sport but 3. So when he comes back the next day he has to make up all of his work if he wants to stay on the team. An example of applying what student learn on the field to off the field is my friend that plays football. He said to me "I could never make a touch down if some one wasn't covering my blind side",then he said, "It's not about ifI win becauseI would have never maid it if there was no one on the team to cover me." Then the next day at his game he maid sure that the crowds were celebrating him and the team when they won. 
Seeking advice from multiple people allows for learning from others' experiences, 
Even if you try to make it easier 
I think the FACS should be used to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom. Having a 3-D computer model, an electonic code, and a facial software sure can all help Facial Action Coding System recongize a humans emotion. 
if you found a pepple that looked like a face. Would you think that humans were once the size of a pepple. Or that if you heared that chocalte milk comes from brown cows would you belive it . 
NASA was looking for Viking 2. 
it better accommodates students 
To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. 
In our modern era, the reality that American public schools have yet failed to implement online learning programs nationally comes across as a damning testament to the slovenliness and archaism of educational bureaucracy. 
We think this because when there is lunch that's our time and when there is free time that is also our time. 
by opening up their imagination and also expands their creativity. 
These kind of people that are scared to show their emotions would get this so they could get a little help to try to show their emotions. But for another reason the same people that have hard time showing their emotions are the one who would probably not use technology. 
also in the school activities there wouldn't be many kids there so it wouldn't make the activities as fun. 
For instance, now people are starting to prove that aliens are real because of a big face-shaped mountain on Mars. 
One method of chosing a President is having an electoral college here in the U.S.A.  That means, the people vote for a group of electors. Not the candidate running for President. In that group they count in the votes and elect witch candidate would win. 
help you stay in shape 
Also, I have some friends and they are taking classes online either and they say that it's a little bit difficult for them understand those classes, because there is no one to teach them how to do what they have to do. They have to figure it out (teach themselves)how to do their works. 
Though there are numerous sensors surrounding the car and the driver is notified when they need to take control, there still isnt enough for a car to work on its own. Even if the car reached the technological point to ensure the safety of the passengers, another large safety concern would be other drivers on the road. Yes, the driverless car can sense when it is about to ensue a collision, it does not have the capability to avoid it, just lik any other car. So, as a human, I would rather trust myself for my safety over technology. 
The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote 
First, Newton County has lots of liter! 
They can even get into a better college than what they would have if they were on their phones all the time. That leads to a good job to support their lives and, if they have a family, their families lives. 
The electoral college has a major arguemnt against it electoral college. is what we might call the disaster. factor 
In the text state that ''The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president.'' that shows that the popular vote is the one who wins. 
you get to see trueley beautifull places 
It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not wing the national popular vote. 
Best arguments in favor of mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The electoral college is regarded as an anachronism. Anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not to fit in the present. Advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not a democratic in a modern sense, its the electors who elect the president, not us (people). 
Last, the author gives more ways Venus can be studied safely using different technology. 
People depend on other's gratification and it feels great when someone likes the outcome of a decision. In order for this to happen, one should ask multiple people for advice and shouldn't only take their's. When I take my own advice, it is often biased towards what I want, and I don't necessarily see all points of view of the decision I have to make. Taking my own advice is beneficial in situations where common sense is used and in situations where I have no one to to ask, such as logical situations or doing school work. 
Education should always come before sports, and if one can get by with C's or D's and continue to participate in Football or whatever else pleases them, then they won't be driven to complete their work with an effort, because they don't need to achieve in academics to achieve in their sport. Education is number one, then comes Football, or Soccer, or Baseball, or Track, and the leniency with academic performance doesn't support that basic fact. 
In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. In this expeirimental community, street parking, driveways, and garages are almost forbidden. Car ownership is however allowed, but the only place to park are large garages at the edge of the development. If you own a car and decide to park there, you must buy a space for $40,000, plus a home! The outcome of this has been most of the community don't own cars. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" this was said by Heidrun Walter, mother of two and a media trainer. Also this communities idea has been adopted around the world. 
" What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! Well i think otherwise. 
Every child leads a different life and is born into a different environment- but the one thing that every child deserves is the chance to receive a quality education. People across the globe have fought for this vital opportunity for decades, advocating for those whose path to knowledge is obscured by circumstance 
But if they all help in community service it may help them a long the road to keep a cleaner environment, and have a good say about your self for good jobs. 
You should as different people only f they gone trough and they have experience with it. 
In conclusion, I think having people do the elections themselves is the better option 
it will make things more expensive and less people will buy them. Some people wouldn't like technology to read their emotions because alot of times people wont be angry at the computer they would be mad because the computer is trying to tell them how they are feeling.  
Did you know that 6 out of 10 kids do extracurricular activities? 
The technology is intended to bring smile to your face. If you smile on a Web ad appears on your screen. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one. The instruction are very simple, all you do is lift corner of your mouth and the computer knows the results. Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. 
Sports will make students to grow to strong and get lots of sunlight. Learning an instrument has been proven to make people smarter. But not just in music, in other curriculum too. Also there is a lot of different clubs out there that can help people with getting jobs or just learn a hobbie too. 
To continue with,the electoral college method can be unfair 
The Electoral College should be kept in use 
The more people you talk to, the more information you'll get. 
So what NASA did was they built a big camera to take pictures of it to prove it was a big rock which it was a huge budget problem for them but they still did it. 
It would also be better because the kid can talk their friends on the other side of the building. 
Teacher may want to have them design them because they think students would make it extremely easy which is fair. 
That is why having multiple perspective of an opinion is good. 
In the pharagh 2, it say, "humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world." Every previous mission was unmanned. You may be asking yourself why , because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours . They belived thats why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus. 
Distance learning is a very wonderful concept when it comes to how we teach children. It allows student to be more comfortable and work by their own schedule for the most part. The fact that technology has become such a common aspect of life that children are able to be taught in this way is an achievement in itself. 
To be able to understand how a person feels may be one of the best new technologies created. Knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to. It could make things better or make things not so good. Just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing. Even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on. 
i think that the more NSA workes together to make tool to go see mre of venus them they will be able to explore more anytime. 
this is false. Students learn best when they are able to connect their own ideas to the curriculum, explore the curriculum by themselves, and conduct self-learning, all of which are only possible via student designed summer projects. 
Another downside to the distance learning system is that students would not have daily interaction or learn how to work with their peers. 
All student with an A, B, or a C average can play any sport they wanted to but every marking period they should have to show the coach's their progress report. 
Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, "Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states." The candidates in the "lame" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are "the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election." Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized. 
they will fall asleep 
The electoral collage is good but not that good. The electoral collage has to choose the president and the vice president. That is not right 
I do not like the idea of driverless cars, becuase i have a lack of trust of computers 
Doing a project about my favorite song wouldn't help me with science 
I personally learn better in an enviroment with other people and teachers that can help me along the way. There are many different and affective ways of homeschooling. I beleive that having an actual teacher with me helps students better succeed in a class or activity. 
The principal should create a rule for each student, requiring that they participate in at least one extracurricular activity. With the number of clubs available for students to participate in there is no reason that each student shouldn't be able to find the activity that best suits them 
being free from time constraints with transportation 
And sometime when they are passing the street of school a car come an have an accented just buy texting and not focusing if a car is coming. 
Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate 
Cell Phones carry A lot of information like the weather or the news and mainly social media. What someone is doing or how they are doing are important to their friends. Many people would agree that these reasons cause them to look at their cell phones 
You should be able to keep the Electoral College so every person has their right in voting and it would be equal 
It's possible to build a skyscraper out of gold, but it would probably require more then all the money on earth to afford it. Even if you could build this golden skysraper, what would happen after that? Gold is a rather soft material so it would most likely weather away as time wore on and would eventually collapse, even if it wasn't destroyed what would you do with a golden skyscraper that you couldn't do with a normal one? "Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at a Radio Shack" 
For instance, if the Democratic elect for 2016 had an aspect he planned to bring to Washington D.C., that a member of the Democratic party didn't agree with, they should be able to vote for whoever they please. Same goes for the electors, who may swing to the opposite party that particular year. 
I think us students of SCHOOL_NAME should have our cell phones during lunch & free period, 
Some new computer softwar that recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation from prof. New techology experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. But each expression is compared against a neutral face. But the computers can identify human emotions like happy, fearful, angry and sad.The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. To faces more expressive the can tell how the person feel sad, angey and happy. Also the video the people can play with friend in school or in online. When student are bored they can play video game and make their happy. The hospital use technology for video surgy. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. so computer need to understand that, too.imagine a computer that knows when you happpy or sad 
Venus is similar to Earth, only in some ways but there are many dangers of going there. 
I think that we should be able to have phones out on free time or other reasons 
What the author is trying to prove with this is the danger despite it presents by being really close to earth. Something else that is really important for us to know is the speed and space. Yea it might not be as important but the author wrote it because he thought it was something important to know . What he means with speed and space is that, With speed it means that sometime Venus is closer to Earth but also sometimes Mars is closer and this because the rate of speed going through. In space is the numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world because of humans. 
We need to change it from the Electoral college to the most popular vote for the president of th Unitd States of America. 
maby when i right this all down he will change his mind. i hope so. 
In the story it says that the natural artifact is like some landforms in the Snake River Plain of Idaho 
People who vote for a president that gets the most popular votes, and they dont win the election, can start big disputes among the way the elections are carried out. 
A popular story at Generic_School, is one of a student who had a below average GPA, but had a fantastic relationship with his Business teacher. He was accepted into a prestigious Ivy league school and after calling them, he found out he was accepted based off of his teacher recommendation. This story shows how having personal relationships with teachers is very beneficial. An online course teacher does not have this same bond as an in-school teacher, and this represents one of the many possible cons. Overall, relationships with teachers has a very crucial and important role in a students life. 
If schools support this idea of having the responsibility of getting good grades, then students will improve academically and intellectually. 
One of the biggest flaws I have is that it is extremely difficult for me to focus on what others need over my own needs. It can be hard to know how to include everyone so they benefit from my actions, as well as make sure no one is being left out 
Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust ,fear and sadness. they are controlled by facial muscles above your eyes. People can tell when u are fake smiling or making a fake facial exspression. There is a new technology called the facial Action coding system enables computers to identify humans emotions. They also exsplain how people can tell what your emotion is by your facial exspressions. They can tell if you are happy or sad just by looking at you also when u fake smile specialist can tell because it streches your mouth sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle. A muscle called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraesus makes crow's feet around your eyes which is also a sign that u have a fake smile. They also explain the steps you can do to show what they are talking about with having "crows feet" when you are fake smiling. moving your facial muscles not only exspressses emotion, but also helps produce them and putting on a happy face eventaully works. some actors have to use these emotions and facial expressions when they are on stage. 
Distance education is actually detrimental to the students who choose to take these courses, due to the lack of typical classroom structure. 
In conclusion, these are the factors that have lead up to phones on the road being a huge mistake. 
Taking high school classes from home would be very beneficial to students and would bring up the overall success rate in high school 
Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that 
In most states, texting while driving has become illegal due to the many health risks that result from it. 
Video conferencing that's good form to learn for some people who want to attend classes from home but if you have any question or any dude you can't ask to this video that's why I thing that the best way to learn is going to school and work hard every day to do and study what we want to do in the future, we have our future in our hand if we do any bad thing some day we pay for that, always we have to think and be sure for what we want and do. in this life everything the we do to somebody good or but someday that thing comeback to you and there woud you feel what other people someday fool for your foult.The old people who have esperience in life they said to students keep going ''if you want you can...'' 
they have more experience, 
I agree with the principal that the students should participate in an after school activity. 
Personally I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. 
All in all, adding more uneccessary technology into the classroom would be distracting to the students and an invaison of their privacy. The "Facial Action Coding system" could be useful somewhere else, just not the classroom. 
Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports, 
if the power went out or if the teacher is gone and there is a break in or if some staff member needs medial treatment and the power is out or if school gets out and a friend ask if you can come over after school 
There are many conserns people may have, but the cars have come a very long way and are becoming even more capable each day. 
When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors 
Have you ever needed advice? I know I have needed advice many times in my life. Everyone needs advice to make better choices. There is no one who can always make the right choice 
Though I'm going against it, I'll still write you a pro about letting students take action on community service. 
One reason is that small states do not get any attention from the upcoming presidents 
Venus's geographical and atmospheric condtions would not be ideal but it would provide anthor option for colonization in the future. 
and in 2001 the face looks like its fading away and in 1976 it looks like it was popping out but when a metor hit it its goes away. 
The electoral college is a way to get votes from people that favor the president or has different belifes and different changes in the next president. Having popular vote for president is a cool way to discover how other people want their society. Most people dont think having popular vote as president is a good idea because they wanna see what will happen or who will become president without there vote being out. 
However, once drivers feel like they have the go ahead to use their cellphone in any capacity, some may still try to go above and beyond to break the rules. Using a phone at any capacity poses a huge risk for all people on the road. 
I like sports, yes they are fun but you don't need them all of the time. A B average is a very good achievement for some students 
i would never go and get a computer to help me with my problems because they dont know everything plus why would you want it in the classroom anyway , someone can come steal it or anything you never now a days people is doing all types of stuff 
The main con is that the machine may take time to read a face and by the time it has been read, the emotion can change. Also, this technology can be expensive, especially for a school with hundreds or even thousands of students 
The face is not created by aliens and here are a few reasons why. 
A driverless car would be beneficial to many people, but they would be even more beneficial to the companies and factories that construct and sell the cars. 
The Facial Action Coding Systm would be cool if the creater could make it read other creachers like cat or a dog for we could see how they feel 
Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population. 
Although, teachers assigning teacher designed work to students work over the summer establishes more structure and easier communication on the assignment and its requirements, 
i like Luke if he was ral or if he is i would like to meet him in person to say how much he helped those people he is a very good person to others. 
knowing they have a reward to look forward to as the go on the field or the track or court. This keep their confidence goes up and the are more energetic to learn and be ready to work and other thing 
I do not agree the fact that driverless cars should be allowed. It has many safety issues for the community and it will cause a lot of problems. It will violate someones privacy,someone can take advantage of driverless cars when they are drunk or tired, and lastly peopel will be upset. I think it depends on the indivuals who are driving. People should start caring more for others when driving because someones life can be at risk if they driver recklessly.Driverless cars will lead into many big problems as well as to many life lost if youre not prepared when your car needs you. 
maybe they don't like to tutor elementary school students, or clean up liter that is not there's. Like me for example I have so many ways of expressing my self. For example I love writing i can write all day, i also like being on the web and home and texting. But by this stuff that i am doing i can also make a change without doing community service. For example because i like writing so much i can write a letter to a animal shelter and help them out. Or who knows, maybe i can even write one to the president of the United States and tell him that we need help down here. 
Doing community service shows that kids actually do care about their town and the environment they live in. 
So that is why I think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us. 
Making these projects student-designed will make the students feel inclined to complete them and it will be fun for them. Having to choose their own topics will encourage them to complete the project. Students should be having fun during the summer, it is their break for completing the school year. Forcing them to work on a topic they no not enjoy will not let them have fun. If students were required to do work during the summer, they should be doing something they choose to do.      
In the first article "What Is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, "Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate." If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a "swing" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a "winner-take-all" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, "Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..." This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for 
What happen if it's not a alien or human what if its just a rock that turned into a face.         
The Electoral College does not give a single voter a chance to sway an election, however America's population as a whole is represented. 
The author also suggests that Venus is a good candidate for exploration because of it's occasional proximity to Earth. "...sometimes [Venus is] our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel" (The Challenge 4). 
I found some information about why we can't text and drive. 
"The Facial Action Coding System enables comuters to identify human emotions." 
The policy of students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have B average is a praiseworthy one because it encourages students to soar academically. 
so I'm both with and against with this argument about if drivers should and shouldn't have their phones while driving    
All they do is go state by state seeing the candidates group of electors  votes. This process takes about 3 to 4 Hours to see what candidate won to be the president of the United States Of America. The President election is held every 4 years, on the tuesday after the first monday in November. 
Extracurricular activities are a great way to do something you enjoy. 
In, addition, making popular votes can help your citizens feel better. 
They would actually do way better doing it at home, because they wouldn't get detracted by anyone that's in the hallway or anyone that in their classroom. The classroom can be a huge distracted to students with everything going on it would be hard for them to get any work done for to even be able to learn everything their suppose to learn. 
Helping the less fortune or the deaf and blind. Even if the deaf couldn't hear what you said, they can see what you said. What if one day our world is being run by a deaf man or woman, and the reason their all the way at the top is because of you. You help them to read and they grow up to become president just because you took time out of your life to help them. 
people like to play sports and when they don't they get mad at you because they failed in there class. 
I think it could be bad because the parents of the kid or the kid himself may not like you doing this sort of thing on him. This is why im kinda on both sides because if they wont done to them I could understand that so thats why i think its fine to not do it if you don't want to. They might not want you to because they might just not want you to know about some of there personal life. 
I do not think you should make it mandatory for everyone to do community service for a few reasons. 
Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.  
Playing a sport teaches you resilience, and how to work with a team. 
The article states that Scientsists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, but only this one had an unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. The scientsts flew to Cydonia for the first to take pictures of the original Viking photos. Thousands were waiting for the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The web site had revealed that the face was not an alien, but it was an natural landform.Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times haper than the original photo. Face was located at 41 degree north matian latitude where it was winter in april, 1998. The camera showed the image and there was no alien monument after all. The picture actually shows the Marian equivalent of a butte landform common around the American West. The scientists tried it again and they just don't pass over the Face very often. 
A teacher will be able to design one that prepares the students well for the upcoming curriculum 
All kids have hobbies even if they might not know it yet, kids may like to draw, write, play sports, collect money, or even just liking to help others. Just with those things anyone can make a difference. 
less money involved 
For Example, the Electoral College resotres some of the weight in the politcial balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies a majority of the vostes cast 
So many things that we could do to make our living environment cleaner: 
Some people say is fun cause you meet new people and you learn new things in the world. 
we should make a vote to see if kids would want to have a school policy of change and having to participate in fun activities but they first need to have at least a B average. 
have an outsiders opinion 
In the difference in seep mean that sometimes we are closer to, Mars and other times to Venus. The author says that on Venus surface, temperatures average over 800 deggrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. 
The chose on have online course can go both way ,it depend on the on problem if most student and teacher complain about wake up to early and not having enough time to get every ready. In my opinion it depend on the situation the school is having ,if it the only way to have to have student to do their work and get everything done then go for it. There is no good or bad option for this. It's all on the situation on hand. Both thing have there goods and there bad ,but it is up for these school departments to know if it will help the student or make it worse than it was already. 
We should take anvteng of this new tecnoligy to better help the people of today. 
the canidate gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurailty. that is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal will umlikely succed to be a president. 
Students might get anxious around a large crowd for many reasons. For one, self conscious people might get anxious because they think that people are judging them for their appearance. Others might have a hard time building up enough confidence to voice their opinion in front of numerous people. 
The good things about having this type of technology in schools is that it have more students be more interested in learning and can help them plan out what they would like to do in their future 
it is a good place to learn about the presudents. 
The first picture that was taken was taken on a cloudy day. The picture was to blurry to be able to make out any details. In 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took another picture that was ten times sharper than the first. One of the cameras they had contributed greatly to the search, since that camera was so sharp they would have easily been able to find any markings from extraterrestrial beings. 
it's the unusual shadows that make it look like a Pharaoh 
some students would not have the time to be able to join an extracurricular activity 
you can also avoid run off elections. The Electoral college avoids the oroblems of and election 
There is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but there should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines. 
When kids don't understand now of the possibilities of their future they are at higher risk of them becoming one of those people. This is the main reason why we should help in our community to make it a better place for the follow up generation. 
We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. 
"The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" (Plumer, Paragraph 14). This is the twenty-first century, and we need to make our elections more modernized to where every voter is happy. A voter should not vote for an elector and hope that the candidate wins but be able to vote for the candidate itself. Even though there are many people against the Electoral College, it still has its defenders. "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency" (Plumer, Paragraph 9). 
However, doing community service, whether you like it or not, makes everyone a better person. 
Students think they can text and listen simultaneously. But truth is all the information is going in one ear and out the other. It is important because it can help you in life. Grades reach higher levels than texting in my opinion. 
How many opinions do you need before you can make a decision? Well, I know that for me personally I ask many people their opinions about my situation and about what actions I should take before my final decision is made. That's just how most people are, they ask many people, they get many opinions, and then they decide which they think is best. However, most people probably don't know why they seek multiple opinions instead of just asking one person. So today I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't just ask one person's opinion because it's so much better to get multiple opinions from multiple different people. 
I belive that each of the electorates should only have a certin percentage of the votes example: Alaska has 3 electorates, each are assigned 33.33333...% of the population and of course due to the decimals one electorate will have a bit more votes all the votes are then added. 76% voted Republican while 22% voted Democrat and the remaining 2% voted for third parties then the first elector would recive the votes of the 22% and the 2% and do fill up the rest of his 33% he would have 9% Republican his vote goes to the Democrates but the other two are left with only Republicans so there are 2 votes for republicans and the learger the population the more electors because of the increased ammount of citizens that each elector votes on behalf. This way the indivaduals that voted democrate are shown but did not really make as much an impact but it shows and may decide the out come during a tie 
This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many. 
Many different organizations have succesfully done it but on closed tracks. These tracks do not have the real world complications that can arise such as road work or accidents that cause the car to go on alternate paths because the original one is blocked. This is when the human must take over and redirect the car. 
You won't have to keep your feelings inside forever. It's a good way to learn about science of emotions even said it in the article. I also think it's a good thing thing to have around kids/teens older people since technology is the furture 
Online schooling will not eliminate a students workload which is a main contributor when it comes to stressed out students, and while it may decrease their workload, once they enter college they may then not know how to manage their assignments properly. 
In school learning allows students to work at their own paste 
However, it fails to do just that 
Most of the time when students have to do projects, it is based off of a subject that is being taught in school: Such as math, history, and science. Letting students be more creative could also allow them to integrate their summer project into their summer schedule. Such as calculating the total amount of hours they have worked, doing historic research on the family vacation spot, or counting how many steps was taken during a hike. 
All in all my beliefs are still the exact same I'm sticking to what I think is right. Everyone has their own opinion but if it would get bad because people think all differently this is just what I have on mind. 
Under the EC voters votes do not count. Even if the entire state votes for one candidate 100% the person representing the state may choose to say that the other candiate won. Therfore messing up the actual count by saying that all the people in that particular state voted for a singular candiate. Now lets be real no state is going to entirely vote for a single candidate,but lets say that Obama's count for Florida was 25% instead of the 75% it supposeably was. Obama would not have won. It is a well known fact that if not for the electoral collage Obama would not have won at all. Same with John Kerry. 
For the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities. There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives. It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future. Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable. Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision. 
Although students creating their own assignments can create more interest and learning opportunities for them, teacher assignments provide a type of structure, formality, and stability it might be difficult for the student to achieve in their design. 
These activities allow them to have a chance to relieve the stress that school has caused them 
In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, "...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors" 
Then the test also states ¨Venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.¨(Paragraph 3) 
The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem would't be valuable computers to identity human emotions. 
they need to keep the most popular one by elections because it would be fair to people to have the electoral votes. 
I know there is the bigger states but  you can always split it boys one one side and all the girls on the other 
Teachers do not know the experiences of the students they are designing projects for, so they may create one that students struggle applying their real-world knowledge to or one that only focuses on the curriculum instead of ways the learning material can be applied to life outside of school. Students can find creative ways to link what they learn in school to its applications in the real world. This better prepares students for their future lives and careers, where they will be applying what they learned in school instead of being continually tested on it. These students are more prepared for what they will be doing after they finish their education because of this prior experience in applying their knowledge and experience. This also reminds students that there is a world outside of school, creating worldly citizens who are able to apply what they learned to solving problems. 
We have table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games to pass the time by. You will be so exuberant that you joined. You will be like a kid on Christmas morning. 
it has helped more than do any damage to any other type of voting like that tabs we once used to vote for everything. 
but these things can still be achieved in an online setting. 
I think that the Electoral College is not fair to American's. We all need to be able to select as who we want as the president of the United States. 
The Elecoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and insentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the elctors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. 
If we help them first then they know who help them. Next time they going help us back too. We have to help them first. 
In our society, technology is advancing significantly by the day. What was once a letter that took 10-day trip overseas to its appropriate destination is now just a simple text message that reaches a person within seconds. The automobile is an innovation that has also advanced dramatically, enough to the point where almost every person who can afford to have one does because of its necessity when transportation becomes a factor. The idea of a car becoming "driverless" is simply another boost in the technology available to cars today, as discussed in "Driverless Cars are Coming." 
can lead people to reach a decision quicker. 
For hundreds of years the traditional school teaching environment has always been in person, sitting in a classroom with a teacher up in front. However, with technology and innovation in the current generations, the traditional classroom teaching environment might change. Currently there are options for students that do not wish to be in a school building but still want to receive education. With modern day technologies, learning online or by video conference has become easy to set up and has become a viable option 
It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question 
I say this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many ways more than one. 
The dangers are stacked high with exlporing Venus. With the temperture on Venus at the surface being over 800*F which in a spacesuit can still fry a person alive, and the litteral aicd rain, could malt the suit and well there goes a dead man. Even if we somehow manage to make a spacesuit that isn't going to melt or fry a person on Venus, then we can explore it. Tech these days is our down fall, we create tech thatwe use everyday, but with all the space exploration that is our go to, because we don't have the tech now to send a person from one side of the galaxy to the other. Once we do that then we can explore. Venus maybe closer to us, but there is no water present on the surface therefor no life could be living on that planet. To study Venus we would have to send someone there to collect samples, at which they have about 80% chance of death right at the moment, and a 20% chance of living 
Also the author talk's about venius having no value . 
because you see the bigger picture 
When you use the Electoral College System, you dont vote for the president of your choice, you're voting for the how ever many representitives that pleged for them 
Even though it is dangerous, the author makes a valid point, NASA should be determined to research Venus since the discoveries made there can possibly give insight on what Earth may become. 
its important to get advice from others, but the more you get, the more clearer and more diverse it becomes. 
Venus is so close to Earth. 
people would pick the one who makes those promises that will only be good for a short time.  The U.S. needs a president who can asure us we wont have to worry about everybody losing there jobs soon or not being able to pay for gas because its up to $4.00 a gallon. 
under the 23 amendment of the constitution , the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and a treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college . this means that because of the electoral college the district of columbia is treated like a state . so electoral college  is the reason why some districts are called a state why take this type of college away if this has such a big role in alot of things to do with the congress . with out the electoral college they wouldnt have presidents or any thing . in every election the electors are always there in every president election every president have their own group of electors behind them . they are joined by a canidates political party 
This hurts victim family members by your mistake of texting and driving and killing the innocent. 
He also states in paragrah five that NASA is working on a methid to buuild on Venus by having large floting blimps that fly over the death and missery of the planets serfice. 
After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            
If you take your precious time and read all Par. 1-8 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely over-afflictionated method is used when determining our next president.  Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people. 
The students environment will be great for the students with the hot weather, great light, and more day time. They could also communicate with one another to talk about the summer project since they are not in a school zone so they are not restricted from using any cellular devices. 
Their children might not come and visit them and help them. So they want to be really happy if their about to die or their really sick. You will also feel good after you do something good for them. 
i think this idea is pretty cool 
Giving students summer projects keeps their brains functioning. Some schools require that students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. 
we can even make going too tutorials a community serves 
"Hey Generic_Name what do you think about this new video game?" Generic_Name asked. "Dont ask just me because then you might be getting a bad opinion from me!" Generic_Name replied. "Okay, I'll make sure to ask someone else as well to get their opinion, thanks Generic_Name!" Generic_Name said 
Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. 
do teachers know that the black community haves like twenty persent of our students in the class room are not going to do the project to help a student during a school break is to go to the student home a give him work or notes to studdy over the break. 
Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it 
it was a natural landform and not an alien monument after all 
So why not do one of them. Why not? Because your scared that your democracy will fail or not win. But whats more important you or your nation?    
But i do believe that if you were to schedule field trips where we were able to go to a national park or something of the sort, students would be more enthusiastic about helping to clean the environment. 
Summer projects are frowned upon by most students. Although some may disagree, schools should require summer work for students. Students not feeling lost and keeping a influential mind set during summer is essential for a good school year. Teachers assigning the projects and learning their students writing and learning methods is key for helping students in the future. Summer projects are useful for students, but are frowned upon because they don't let the students have as much freedom as they want. Some projects may seem unfitting and unnecessary; however, they keep the minds running and working efficiently. 
This is coming from a middle school student who takes algebra 1 in 8th grade and is recommended for English honors for high school next fall. That isn't pleased with a single b in any class that gets straight a' s. 
allows for a more unbiased response, 
But they said venus is like the earth twin. So do you think that it was once life on that plantet before in the past and the sun ruined it so there no more life everything is excint on that planet. 
Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. 
Not only does a classroom have abundant learning materials and information, but it also has students who help each other grow and prosper in their learning environment. For hundreds of years, the traditional desk-and-chalkboard schooling system has been used, and over those years, people are still excelling and test scores are still rising. This is because the school stimulates the mind like nothing else; it allows children a place to let their curiosity wander and lead their education. To take away the school will take away the stimulation. 
If we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. If you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority's vote. 
Therefore, yes i think this new technology would work because the three-D model can detect the true feelings you have and calculate it 
some people own cars some dont some take bus but some work so they can own there own car. there has been a large drop in the percentage 16-to 39 year olds getting there license and other people who already have there license are renewing them, kids get jobs so that when there more older there able to get there own car without asking there parents to take them places . 
In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to effectively retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult. 
To start, the Electoral Collage helps in deciding who is gonna be the President 
The "Evening Star" or otherwise known as Venus is a very dangerous planet. 
Developing leadership skills for the future are offered through student-designed projects. 
Summer projects should be designed by teachers 
people can not survive the landing, 
See we will never uncover the truth if we dont break out of our shell and go exporing to the unknown we have to do it. Nobody esle is going to go out into space and find out what is really up in space. 
These cars aren't safe to drive in conditions like these. The smart car isn't smart enough to be driving in different types of weather or situations. 
Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed. 
It has the hottest surface temperature. 
I beleive that we should throw out the electoral colledge and not use it anymore. Today it is irrelevant and it does not help out the elections, in fact I think it only causes trouble. 
In my oppinion I think the people should vote. 
To some kids even care about their phone cause they are business but when they a free time they maybe use their phone also kids are smart the teacher wont notice we are 
If I was a scientist on Mars with somone who thought the face was formed by aliens, I think I would disagree. I would disagree because aliens are not real and why would they just made a radom face into the ground. I would say that the land in that area is just deformed 
In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms for students. They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. It will help students and teachers understand eachother better. Overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all. 
I think this is a good idea because say a student was having a bad day at school, the computer can tell if you are having a bad day and so the teacher wouldnt ask any questions, try to make you stand infront of the class reading a book or doing a math problem on the board. 
In classrooms, the teacher chooses the pace at which they go at, and students have to follow it even if it's to fast for them and they get left behind. With online learning tho, it allows students to pause and rewind videos or even go back and understand something they didn't fully understand. Students could play videos again and again and review the videos as many times as they need to so they can understand, something that can't be done in a classroom. In classrooms, the teacher will just say things once, review it a little and explain, then move on. Online learning would allow all students to be able to fully understand and grasp a concept. 
First off, it's important to acknowledge that accidents happen on the open road every day, with the primary cause being mistakes that drivers make. Therefore, manual vechicles are not necessairily dangerous, but are not as reliable as an automatic vehicle. Think about other practical additions that help consumers, such as a lifeguard on a beach. If they weren't there, would we be as safe? Probably not. Therefore, if the addition of driverless cars ensures that a safer option is available, then it only makes sense that the advantage should be taken. 
I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. 
Asking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes.  
This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. 
The argument that isn't even factual.You are going off of a guess in your mind. 
For instance if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry, they would go to Congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes 
It is the 21st century new things are coming out all the time every one has a cell phone or ipod or something you would think that we would be able to take our electronics to school by now 
Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home 
We wouldn't have anything bad happen to us because we discovered life on Mars we would get rewarded for discovering life on Mars so why would we hide it? 
Reaching the final conclusion is up to you. Is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not? 
because in online classes there is no teacher to explain you clearly how to do the work that you are studying. 
because even if they are the most studious person in the world that temptation to become distracted will still always be there. Someone who demonstrates this perfectly is my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name is probably one of the most hard working people I have ever known, not only does he take high level courses for his age but he also does track all while being home schooled. Not only will he deny every offer of a hangout but he will also stay up way later than he should just to finish his latest assignment, but even though he does all of these things I will occasionally catch him logging into Minecraft when I know he shouldnt be, and because of this he usually has awful time management skills. This just goes to show how distance learning not only makes it easier to become distracted because of how convenient it is but also how it enforces bad study habits because of the lack of a classroom. 
I believe that we should change the election to the most popular vote instead of keeping the electorial college . The Electoral College was a good idea proposed by the Founding Fauthers , But i believe that it is time to kind of switch it up. 
Second in the artical it said "it spotted shadowy likeness of a human face" which can mean that when the picture was captured the camera could have of captured some shadows to which can create an illusion of a face when in reality it could be the showdows. 
It is not unusual for these landforms to occur. It is just the certain shape that sees to have cought everyone's attention. 
I would like to comment on your recent school policy that stated that students must have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities. 
with the teachers you learn more because they tell to you to try to do it in your own and you have an idea to what are you going to do. 
NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentful anc radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions. 
In the passage, they talk about how a google cofounder, Sergey Brin, evinsions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. How relieving would it be to go places, especially at night, without worrying about the next car to get wrecked? Some people say that such cars will fundamentally change the world, as said in paragraph 1. 
The choices someone will make are usually decided on their point of view, meaning that their decision are based solely of what they think. When someone goes to multiple viewpoints, they can see the different perspectives on how people view things. This will lead them to be more open-minded on what they choose to do. Having a more open-mind can then lead to better choices and wisdom for the future. For example, if someone knows that a specific company provides low quality items, they can know that in the future they should not buy items from that company. 
Why? because there will be less fights and arguments it will be all up to one elector to pick a president plus all the people that voted. I think it should be a llitle diffrent the elector should vote like a regular person but hes vote costs 500 votes so it will be half fair and helps the president he wants a little. The bad things are that people wouldn't think it's fair and the elector will have alot of pressure. The good things is that there wont be arguments or fights and thats what its all about.            
Community service will change people's lives and attitudes for the better. They will be in a better mood, and they will live a more happier life. 
I've been in minor car accidents due to teens or adults on their phones not paying attention on the road, I've also seen many of my older relatives go on their phones while on the road. 
Many students struggle during the school year because of missing school days, whether it's due to weather or due to a family situation, and distance learning would be a great option for those students to be able to stay on track with the school curriculum while missing school. Offering online learning will help a student continue their education, prevent them from falling behind in school, and create less stress for them to catch up on missed work; therefore, I think online learning would be beneficial for students and that schools should implement it into their systems.  
Just imagine if on every single issue every single person would have to vote on the outcome to pass anything would take such a long time. Including the elections, the electoral college makes a short sweet way for voting, the population votes and then they vote for what we voted for (most of the time...) 
There are many things up in Mars. Some , well many, that we do not even know about. Now many believe the face on Mars was created my aliens. But, how could it be so? 
For years, students have gone to school in a typical classroom setting; however, an increase in technology has led to a rise in the amount of students opting to take online classes. The argument is whether these online classes are as beneficial to a student as a traditional classroom setting would be. 
Ther is some like this one in the west. ONe is the middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. Some people say that nasa is hideing that there is life on mars and they say there is not. 
I think that in the next cople of years people well be able to go there an resurch and get the stuff they want from there. Like studing the rock and whatever ese they have up there. He made a lot of good statments about how we wouldnt be able to get thst close because the remputer is so hot. Even if you whernt thst close it would still be 170 degrees and that is still really hpot and can hurt someone. they would have to figure out a outfit or suit that can make it do its not so hot so they can go up there and resurch. They would have to make a rocket that could float because it the rocket touched Venus it would melt and they would die up there. 
The benefits of switching to popular vote really pays off. With popular vote, these issues adressed would not be a problem at all 
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers. 
The citizens of your state are crying injustice, but nothing is being done to serve them. The Electoral College goes against the Bill of Rights opening words of "We the People". The current system of electing the President is more complex and less beneficial than choosing our leader through popular vote. 
you would know excacly how many people actually picked the president of the united states. 
According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years. 
Asking different people advice on a certain subject will provide you will an immense amount of stuff you didnt talk about and or stuff you didnt even think about. Bringing in different point of views into a two or more person situation will help you decide on whats the best choice to make. Talking to other people will also allow an opportunity for the other person to give you important key facts to your situation. They might bring up past experiences they have had or that their friend has had in the past, they might even be in the same position as you are right now. In the end no matter how hard or difficult your situation is its always better to get extra help and advice along the way. 
For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. 
like ''mom i just got accepted to a concert in band'' or ''mom there is a crazy guy in school and we are in lock down I'll call you back when you can come pick me up' 
to insure students are expanding their learning throughout the summer, teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects. 
every day and every night and even when the presidents done being the president they still have guys protecting them from danger. 
some people may have experience in the decision you are trying to decide 
Somebody would hopefully be kind enough and ask if there doing okay or if they need somebody to talk to instead of just having to go thruogh it them selves, just like a child going thru depresion at the end of the day you want to look for those children and help them 
Maybe most teachers feel that if students really cared about learning and school, that it doesn't matter when the project is assigned to you, you should just do it. Also, teachers may think with all the time during the summer, students should have plenty of time to balance managing their summer fun with their summer projects. In some teachers head, I think they may be saying if you care enough to learn and keep your brain and mind focused during the break, doing the projects when they assign they should be no issue at all 
If i had to pick one activity it would be student council because i can help people like if their going through tough times. 
However, many argue that the student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, for distance learning would encourage laziness and create a communication barrier between students and others 
which means the tradition have lasted for decades and it shall not end now it shall remain forever. 
I think that every student should do community service 
The author claims that the limits of these terrifying endeavors should not be limited by the planets harsh conditions. The author also claims that the planet is hot enough to melt most types of metal. 
Imeag you could tell if someone is facking a exspressen or forceing it with this tec we could. 
A student who is knowable able about history may design a project about Ancient Egypt,but if they already know the topic,they aren't learning anything. And while having the students create the projects may allow for more originality in the type and topic of them. That dosen't give the teacher the view of the student that they are meant to give teachers. Most students will design the project if given the chance to be easy so that they can have a good grade to start the year out. But that dosen't let the teacher see their strength and weakness,and the puts them at a disadvantage because the teacher wont know were the need help till it might be to late. If a student knows they have an English timed writing in Ms. Generic_Name class when they get into school,and they get to pic the book they analyze for it. They will pick and book probably that is on the easier side and that they understand. But if they are assigned a book by Ms. Generic_Name, she can see what skills they need when they do the writing. 
If a real person is reading this then you will understand what I am trying to tell you. Also if you were wise as well then you can understand what I am trying say by, "you can never trust if the item will work or not." 
Another thing is the disaster factor. 
but Im just telling the truth. 
Our opinions are shaped by other's opinions through out our lives. In order to build an opinion to take action or maybe to just keep it to ourselves, we must learn new angles and learn new opinions. 
venus would be a nice planet to study because i feel like is has alot of interesting things to know about like whats in it i would study a planet like venus and the size of venus is simular to the earth so it would be nice to know a place close to the sun 
See there is your proof. 
they have credibility in their subject 
For example, one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor.He enjoys it a lot, especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them. 
different people from different cultures can have other ideas. 
We are the that have to live with this president 
that object that was found on mars is only land built up that looks some what like a face and not a statue or remains of a living person or creature. but something that was a different landform a long time ago before it became what is know as the face on mars. 
The photo just happened to be taken at the right time, at the right angle, by a pilgrim piece of technology. Further pictures, such as the ones taken in 2001, reveal that the "face" is just a mesa, with next to no details that resemble that of a human complextion. Think of it as the"...Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..." (paragraph 12) 
It can help if you have a friend or family member you can trust that has a strong opinion, because sometimes you need it. There is always going to be a couple or strong people in your life that's going to help you make right decisions either if you are going down the wrong road, or if you are doing the right thing in life and you just need motivation. If a person was struggling in high school and they really needed to step up their life and grown up more, they would really need to good influences or somebody to tell them where they are going wrong. People that can step up with their own voice on the situation that has known the person, and that could really help them get their life together. Personally, the type of people everyone needs is somebody that has strong beliefs and values and that would care for their loved ones. That could especially help in benefiting someone's life going toward the future 
less smog or pollution 
So that is the reaons I think we should not have the facial action coding systems. 
Traveling to Venus isn't imposible 
All in all, driverless cars are unsafe and an illogical invention. The lack of attention that is needed when not driving a car will result in mass accidents and injuries when a driver is needed. Entertainment systems in cars only add to the danger in driverless cars and are unnecessary. Crashes and accidents can not be settled or avenged in court because there is no clear cause to the incident. Though the sensor technology incorporated in the driverless cars gives an advantage for braking and controling the vehicle, the bad outweighs the good in this situation. Driverless cars may be a thing of the future but as of right now, humans are not ready to hit the road without a person behind the wheel. 
I think community service should not be a requirement ,but strongly suggest it to the students. 
I believe that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school, and use them when they have free times. examples(lunch periods, and other free times.) 
Limiting the use of cars can bring less stress to the everyday driver. 
So please, please allow students at least that much time to use their cell phones.Please go with policy 2.Besides, maybe if you allow students at least a little time to use their cell phones maybe, just maybe, they won't break the rules by using them in class anyway, so all I'm asking is just please take this letter into consideration. 
The people who ,not only want to play sports or other activities but are willing to do good in school will do better in school because of the worry that they might not be able to do this anymore. 
When the viking took the picture it was 1.56 meters and when the vikings were not around no more Nasa took the picture again and it was 43 meters per pixel. 
Students should be able to attend classes from home 
In conclusion, the "Face on Mars" is really a mystery. Many think it is a natural landform while others think that it was built for a reason by aliens. The "Face on Mars" is a natural landformation becuase of the pictures presented, the Internet, and the location on the landform.   
The face on the planet is just a weird land marking. It was not made by aliens it was only just luck that it was there. 
There is a disaster factor.  According to "Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people. 
If we are voting for president the majority of thr votes goes to the president who earn it which says that these people of the U.S need the president they voted for which is the president who won 
I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
Is the Face on Mars created by an alien? No, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. 
But a face from an allien, that sounds, and is unlogical. We have done so much reasarch towards this landform. Shadows give it the look of a face, and thats why we can only see it sometimes. In fact mission controllers even said you had to capture it at the correct lighting. But, if it were a real face, you could see it anytime. 
It is a very stressful situation for those students that have fallen ill to catch up to their peers. Missing out on a proper education due to something that could not be controlled is a very stressful situation in it of itself. There are parents that force their kids to go to school despite being sick, putting other students at risk of illness and not giving the sick student a proper learning experience. It gets even worse for those unfortunately inflicted with terminal illness, who must miss school for long periods at a time 
I think this technology which is called the '' Facial Action System'' is valuable because it would help out teachers and students. 
To state senator i'm argue is that we should keep the Electoral College 
if you really think about it becuase it won't take 30 mins wasting class time on to log in to a computer if you scan your face it would be alot easier to sigh in and get straight to the lesson. 
Do you wanna take care of horses,young cows,and mules? Well if you do,Join the Seagoing Cowboys in taking our adventure ot help people anad places bombed in World War ll. 
For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in wich they have a car- free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting trasnportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, resturaunts, and shopping districts being created. 
When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party. On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process? Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning? Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student? 
Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice 
Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, "I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step. 
Some people think that the Electoral College was unfair back-then 
Its equal rights and justice. 
Some things that bring conflict to this whole process is that some peoples votes wont have effect in the voting for who becomes president next or not. 
would make attending class easier by not requiring students to wake up as early as they do and prepare for school. 
If students could create their own assignments, they would actually do the work to get it done. 
This is one thing that makes this form of voting very unfair. Obviously it is smart to give somestates more representatives because of their population but that completly defeats the purpose of making it fair because the small states stand no chance against the densely populated ones like Florida, Texas, California, and New York. 
Like it says in the article Does the elctoral college work?, states that "when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for candidates electors". like seriously who are these "electors 
Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important. 
you can't believe anybody that has no evidence 
If my principal had decided thatALLstudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports, work on the year book, or serve on the student council. I would strongly disagree 
The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones. 
we could recycle our paper, cans, and cell phones or ink cartages. 
There were a lot of failed missions to the moon and now look what we know about it. We learned so much because people decided to risk their lives in order for us to learn more about the universe. We can do so much good with the world and if we have the choice of trying to go to Venus, shouldn't we try? The only way we know we're going to fail is if we don't try and not trying would be a diservice to people. 
Another reason is, most of them would not want to be picking up litter 
If someone is given two options, they will likely take less time thinking over the options and choosing between the two than they would if given multiple. 
This attracted the publics attention and it became a huge pop icon that appeared in books,magazinse,radio talk shows,and even in grocery store isles for Twenty-Five years. 
If they want to do it that's there thing . that what they want to we should force them i know you have the right be they have there own right.Now if they want to do community service then ha who stopping them. 
really they are still learning 
students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, 
Like Garvin said its a type of landform that happens in the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho 
Although some may disagree it would be more beneficial for students to participate in online classes. 
Extracurricular activities provide lots of opportunities for students. You will make lots of memories and friends from joining these clubs. Many students have joined activities and enjoyed being involved so they kept doing that same club every year 
Doing little things like walking your neighbors dog, or help babysit your cousins is enough for students who have extracurricular activities, and boat loads of homework. Many students do participate in community service, and many also do extracurricular activities. 
it is helpful because it will make you see your problem in a different way. It gives you reasons why you should do something and why you shouldn't something. It gives the person who is asking for advice two options. Let's say you broke your moms TV remote and you don't know how to tell your her so you ask a friend what would they do if they were you. Your friend gives you their feedback and you still aren't sure if that was good advice so you ask some other friends and they tell you what they think you should do and you come to your answer. Asking multiple people on a problem will help you in many ways because they can give you a reason why you should do something and give you their feedback and they try to help you. 
On May 24,2001 NASA sent Viking 1 in to outer space but what it found were still trying to figure out could there be life on Mars. The Viking sent back pictures of mars carved into it was a illusion of eyes nose and mouth so let me say again can there be life not just on earth but on Mars the question is still to be answerd. NASA says the have witness alot of things up that we dont know or could even imagin there could be life on every plant and if there is I know we all want to witness it one day. I know I am not the only one who would want to explore through out the box through out the earth but may I say the question is still out there for me for you for the future. So let that be known that you and me and what ever is out there are alike curious to seek and craving for advanture. You and me both will fly out of here hand by hand sister to brother to find whats on mars in the future qustion that is waiting to be answerd will be seen head smelled by the ones who are seeking that adventure to answer that qustion that we all what to know. Is there life on mars.   
I think that all kids should do community service to make their lives and the community a better place. 
One of the highest point of this people who supporting the students are taking classes at home is. The student will have enough time to do many work than students who are taking classes at school 
Another reason that we are completely sure it's a landform is because we can't spot any sign of life on the face 
it can provide different perspectives, 
Alote of people say its unfair. Mostly because of the winner-take-all system. 
There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..." that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents. 
The use of mobile devices while on the road leads to distracted driving which means that the driver is less likely to notice road and safety signals, Pedestrians and the signals coming from other vehicles. Failure to heed these signals has led to injuries and death that could have been prevented had the driver not been using a mobile device while on the wheel. In the U.S., there are laws banning the use of mobile devices or the act of texting while someone is on the wheel.The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving ("Texting and Driving Accident Statistics"). Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high and can pose serious safety risks. You can be charged with murder for texting and driving. Texting is the most alarming distraction sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for a couple of seconds. Using a cellphone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries onU.S. roads. In 2017 alone 3,166 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes including distracted drivers. Texting and driving is against the law ("The Dangers of Distracted Driving"). 
Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. 
Online distance learning would not benefit students because it takes away the option of direct communication which is key when it comes to learning new curricular. The chance of cheating and laziness increase with taking online classes because its based on your schedule and you learn from your own computer. Also it takes away from socializing with other students and making new friends to spend time with and also losing the option to try after school activities. Also students could have many issues accessing the lessons which would ultimately disrupt their learning. Some schools may offer the option to attend classes while at home but students wouldn't benefit as much as attending classes at school.         
With the electoral college way of electing a president voters arent actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors who will then vote for the candidate. There are so many things that can go wrong when electing like this 
prevent them from learning about their identity. 
Think back to the last time you attended school and how tedious it was progressing through each day. Chances are you quickly grew tired of the monotonous cycle every week, and would prefer to have an easier and more efficient way to learn. Luckily, students have no need to worry over this with the recent introduction of a new learning method, and that is through online or video conferencing. This outstanding idea has allowed an immense amount of people to learn even though the numerous amount of obstacles facing their way, be it poor health or even just being away from school for a definite period of time. With this new way of processing the knowledge one would normally learn in a school environment, it has proved itself to be a great alternative to the normal learning process 
The face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. 
If the student is some what shy or is trying out something new, then they can open up with others and would try to be comfortable with the environment and the way they cope. 
People in the toss up state are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide who gets elected. They are the more thoughtful voter and they will give more attention than normal. So people who care about who gets elected should get their votes in. 
Luckes claims helped me choose to convine people to join the seagoing cowboys program by you get to see all the historical places and get to see whats left in ruins. 
Overall, students should have access to a path of learning that is catered to them. This path should accomadate for teachers and learners ease, saftey, and the students social needs. Home is the best place for a student to learn away from the school campus especially when point-blank bullying and mass schootings are taken into consideration. However, the students social life will not be diminished in anyway with the aid of group video conferences. The students online acedemic career will reflect how they learn best.  
some parents and teachers say alllowing the students to design their own project is care less and they will make horrible choices. 
The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a "messa brutte" 
allow students to go at their own pace 
Everyone has a right to vote for who they would like or trust as president. 
showing others you care . 
The author absolutely makes no point because you still are basicly puting in a vote for the president but just not directly. The Electoral College  is the way America organizes the voting system. 
In a school there are hundreds of resources at a child's fingertips: libraries full of books, teachers full of knowledge, materials full of the ability to educate. While the home may have educational resources, the vast amount does not compare to that of a traditional school. 
"This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency." This means that the President who gets the most popular votes is less likely to win over the electors votes. It seems like the electors are never agreeing with people's votes because, usually the popular vote never wins 
In paragraph nine,  the text says, "... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. 
This could help it so much. We could change people's lives by doing this. This is a important job for people, because it could keep people from dieing. 
Overall the Electoral College is one of the brightest decisions that America has made. For one the Electoral College gives people a fair chance in becoming president. Also the Electoral College helps make the voting process a lot easier. 
In conclusion Mr. Senator the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational because it is unfair to voters, there could be a tie in the electoral vote and the voters are merely voting for a slate of electors and not there president. 
There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which of would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. 
Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better. This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects. They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to. These connections are important since they provide useful information. With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would. 
Incase you have not heard the "face" has been spotted on Mars, a small landform with some facial features that make it look like one. 
because there are many dumb drivers without phones in their hands and the good drivers turn worse with one in their hands. 
Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in California. 
if the NASA cameras did not see any people/aliens. On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world 
Lots of people try to figure out her history on her emotions. Someone uses a 3d computer and he figures out that she has 6 other emotions of herself. 
I think this idea it great it would be a good invention of soemthing to read people's emotion it could happend because unconsciously imitate another person's felling and also facial experssions. 
The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. 
We all have a choice for diffrent things, 
students at school and adults at work can get distracted bye a cell phone. 
Yes, some students might not be as devoted as other students to get their work done 
Larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because of the majority vote in the particular state. 
As a child grows, so do their interests and beliefs 
Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience. 
There are advantages to this way of life 
Building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. When you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. This will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help. 
I think it can be good for them, make them get more involved, and good to participate in extracurricular activities, are all great ways of showing how students should participate. 
After the Presidential election,your governer prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respected electors. the Certificate shows that the winning Presidential candidate in your state and shows which will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. 
So the best thing is to pay attention to who everyone in the United States is voting for instead of the Electoral College. If we keep voting like this sooner or later everyone is going to get fed up with it and do something about it themselves. 
some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze. 
With all the easy fixes, solutions and prep planned for Venus, the author's claim is overwhelmingly supported. The author proved Venus is certainly a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
Although the intentions behind distance learning have just reasoning the widespread implementation of this type of learning would have detrimental effects on students across the country. 
I know you set high standards for us to achieve and you will get those soon, but in the mean time, I believe to participate in sports you should at least have above a D. 
Distance learning has many benefits 
Yes, also true the electoral vote keeps other parties who are not sufficient enough to run the country 
People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green. 
Another thing great about the Seagoing cowboys is that if you like helping animals you should do it. 
Last but not least school conciol. The school counciol does a lot of things here are a few. 
learning your social skills 
People are dying because they wantTheir girlfriend/boyfriend to think their cool. We are also hurting ourselves by putting us and a badCrash we are getting hurt. 
Honestly helping someone would feel great. 
But with almost 30 years of technology being developed since he was last in a classroom, you can theoretically instead do it online and cut out physical school entirely from your educational life. This development has potential to change education for the better of pretty much all of us. 
the grades will be higher, 
it allows you more views of a topic 
That is more than half of the United States population, therefore we should get rid of it. I believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. Also, it will make choosing the president of the U.S. up to the people. 
Beacause the founding fathers etablished it in theConstitution as a compromise between election of thePresident by a vote inCongress and elction of thePresident by a poular of qualified citizens. We would not want to change theConstitution that are great founding fathers had once made before 
But the other student they dont like to do any of that but they are being focus to do stuff. 
Many students don't want to do anything school related over the summer. By assigning them projects, they have to take time to do something they don't want to do. However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves. These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests. They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher. 
the Toyota Prius that uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel which would allow you to estimate how far away or close you are to a curb or another vehicle. 
I'm not saying that having phones during free periods and lunch is a bad thing but it may be in some situations. To be specific they might text during a test or maybe in the middle of class and its embarrassing not only to them but the teacher. The class may think its funny but some people just find it aggravating if this does happen i think that the students phone should be taken away. 
the writer says that Venus, "has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." These features are exactly what earth has as well. 
But there is one problem there is no oxygen up in space so those up there would die in a matter of seconds. 
this is a method in which only states with a certain amount of people allowed to vite. this is an unfair method because, for example hawaii has only a little amount of people and cant vote. also many other states cannot vote because of there population. this is very unfair and should be stopped. every state should be able vote. and again there is only one vote for each state and this method should be voted by state but by people to get a better examnation of what people want. since each state only cast one vote it is the senates job to pretty much vote for the elector. we should let the people vote the people vote themsleves so there is a more accurate vote,than just a single vote for the whole state. 
cats wag there tail but my cat is happy when he wags his tail what dose that mean than?My dog growls when he vplays what dose it mean? Maby later on they can move on from human faces to other animal faces. 
some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from by way of online or video conferening. I think everyone hsa different ideas about offeing this option that stuednts attend classes from by way of online or video conferencing. I am completly disagree with this offer or option 
Taking part in a extra activities requires many resources which some people can't afford or simply don't have. 
I think that students should be able to perform community service 
such as simplified electrnics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface . So far they have lasted for 3 weeks in these conditions which is more than enough time hopefully for them to be able to grab enough information. Their other project that they are working on is using an old technology called mechanical computers. They are powerful, flexible, and quick. Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces 
some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. 
So i think we should keep electoral college because it's a process not a place. 
What I need are some people that care to do some of the community service 
the cost 
One reason some people chose to have the electoral vote is because the president is winning everything. And the electoral college requires a presidental candidate. 
I dont think that the principle should be able to make the students do an extracurricular activity that they dont want to do or like doing 
Although it is essential for students to continue to actively use their brain during their break, it is essential that the project should be student designed, 
Texting while driving can limit your response to someone coming out of nowhere, whether if it's a child, an adult, or a group of teens. When having less time to respond to something in the road while texting and driving it may lead to many accidents and deaths. In addition, the usage of your phone while driving can cause a dangerous environment to the people around you on the road. Anyone can walk into the road at any time of the day and staying off your phone prevents anyone including yourself from getting hurt. In the same way, texting while driving causes many dangers risking not only young teens lives, but also adults lives in future accidents. Texting while driving "causes own deaths and others, and need to pay attention to what's going on". Meanwhile, while driving needs to be taken more serious you never know what to expect on the road. 
Just like the Google cofounder Sergey Brin, I too also visualize a future where cars just aren't much of a use to the world much anymore. 
But now i see we need to have a change and just start walking and finding another way other then our cars 
The author only explained the risk involved in exploring Venus, and not why we should, despite the risk.An example of a random fact that does not back up the authors suggestion: Spacecrafts that land on Venus never come back and only last about two to three hours. 
looking back at the two planets history, 
So in conclusion replacing the electoral college would be unfair to former presidents, unfirmilaur to people who have used the electoral college, and and everything we've achieved would be changed.    
For example you just got a new book from Target, a lot of your friends have had the same book for a couple of months now and so has your mother. The first person you asked was your mother, you ask, "I've been wanting to read this new book for months and you're one of the best person to ask since you've just finished reading it." Your mother replies in a gloomy tone,"To be very honest with you, I did not enjoy the book that much. The plot was very confusing and I also didn't understand the theme of the book that well." The next day you go to school and you ask your best friend Generic_Name, " I need your opinion on the bookDrama that I just got." Generic_Name answered with excitement, "It was a very interesting book, i'd read it a million times if I could. Every detail in the book was absolutely amazing, the pictures that were apart of the comic were brightly colored and beautiful." During lunch you ask for friend Generic_Name how she felt about the book. She politely responded with, "I didn't find that book as interesting as many people did. It had beautiful pictures but other then that it was kind of boring to be honest with you." 
each state gets the correct amount of power 
Also the principle should help them see how hard is for other people to live so they will relice that they are lucky have parent or to go to school because there are people who do not have anything. 
Many students in the United States have been diagnosed with a learning disability. Whether is be reading, understand, or they just generally struggle to grasp a concept, these student have it hard. They are already given a disadvantage when they enter into the learning ring. Many of the students attend summer programs to assist them with their disabilities. Many teachers do not take this into account which leads to upset, angry, and stressed out students who truly can't help it. However, with them in control of these summer projects they could make something that conforms to them. 
Online classes also helps because some students have a hard time waking up early in the morning to school which causes you to be late everytime,being late can lead you to detention,saturday school and other things. 
Psychologist Erik Erickson developed the eight significant psycho social stages that outline the common conflicts experienced throughout a lifetime. In his seventh stage, known as "integrity vs. despair," he describes the adulthood stage when people look back on their life. Many adults in this stage scroll through their overall progress and accomplishments. They decide if they spent their time wisely and lived a fulfilling life. If they look back at life and conclude that it was spent efficiently, they experience a sense of integrity. On the other hand, if they feel as if they did not make the most of their time on earth, they develop a terrible feeling of despair. It is important that students, being at such a young age, recognize the value of time. Although everyone remembers the saying "life is short," many people forget to practice what they preach. If students are given teacher-designed projects, this will ensure that they efficiently spend their time during summer break. 
So step by step, we should start shaping the future of this generation and the future of the United States by doing community service!!! 
The student would be working on their own time and not on any teachers'. During the summer when people are on vacation and need time off its a great idea to allow student's to get work done, but also have time to do what they desire over break. There's nothing better than working on your own time, having fun, and still getting things accomplished. 
the best option for society is to not have driverless cars because, they promote less disciplined actions with teen and adult drivers, they would not benefit the economy, and finally these driverless cars put safety features at risk compared to having an able-bodied human to do the manual functions when presented them. 
Every student should do at least 2 community services. Maybe one at home and one at school 
But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled.If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together. 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant. 
Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that "Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.          
Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot.  Heidrun Walter claims " When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much mappier this way ( In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3)." One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles.  In fact "70 percdent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her (In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3)." These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch. 
Driverless cars will bring benefits in a way, but also many complications. Accidents are most likely to occur because humans are not driving the vehicle, but the vehicle itself is driving. There would be uprises on who you can actually blame since the driver was driving but the manufacturer created it. There would be no point in getting a license if you are not driving the car. Driverless cars are going to be pointless to even own if you are not driving the car yourself.        
Helping people in need is really what matters in lfe 
The people say its unfaire the way the vote for president. 
As the times have progressed, cell phones have become extremely prevalent in the daily lives of many. To add on, cell phone usage has also increased substantially. From playing music in the shower to using phones to keeping daily tasks organized, cell phones have grown to become an essential part of human life. It is hard to deny that cell phones have become so infused in our daily lives. This has caused many to pose the question as to whether or not cell should be allowed to be used in any capacity when operating a vehicle. While a total ban of cellphone usage may seem unrealistic,using a phone at any capacity not only poses a threat to the driver or the passengers but also other drivers on the road 
The creation of these seeming easy cars would actually make everyones life harder, not only on the roads, but in the court rooms as well 
Overall, attending classes from home does not benefit students in the long run because there is an absence of guidance, personal connections with teachers, and social skills. All of these ideas are critical in a teenagers life and taking online classes prevents this. Schools should steer away from this new way of teaching and should attempt to maintain the current standards of teaching. The education of a student is very important, and the school system should do everything in its capability to improve it.           
Also if a student is bored this will make the lesson not as boring as it is for the student. 
if you do good in school that mite do the trick to. 
If we could actually have technology that does that like when a add pops up and you get mad then another one pops up and your happy then another one could pop up and it could be innapropiate. 
Students taking classes online will be very beneficial. My overall reasoning behind this is a lot of the problems that students face is because of the students and the teachers in the building. Online education eliminated those factors. Students distractions will be limited. The environment will be safer. It is sometimes necessary for students to take online classes at home therefore it should always be an option. The big picture is to make our next leading generation more educated than the last. Whatever makes that easier should be employed into our school systems.  
Hello, my name is Hannah. I am a scientist at NASA who has been studying the "face" on Mars over the years. Today my close friend Mason had asked me about any imformation I've found out recently. 
Venus has dangers it despites, but can be so interesting to invest more on. The author thinks Venus may be the most earth-like plannet in our system. It is like Earth's 'twin'. So, if it's similar to Earth, why not look more forward to studying Venus. It is important to know what's surrounded in Earth.   
Sometimes everyone can be stoborn. And when certin people dont get whet they want then they can do bad things 
It is best to get advice from more than one person 
These are the reasons why i think that the electoral college does not work. Anymore in todays modern times where it is all out dated.    
In conclusion technology that scans your face to read your emotions has too many ethical questions, financial problems, and no personal connections for this computer process to be acceptable in the classroom. Although this advancement is impressive, the classroom setting is most definitely not the right place for this type of computer process. 
For example, if you ask a random student, "Would you like to help me pick up trash?" they are most likely to say they have something better to do. If they were told they have to, it would get done and if you added something that is entertaining to that person they are more likely to come back and help again. 
The streets of some towns not just Sparta are not always clean. If the kids start to pick up the trash on the side of the road the streets will get cleaner. It could also effect those who through their trash out their car window. For example, they might say wow look what I'm making these kids do. I'm making them cleanup after me. This could get someone like that to stop throwing their trash out a window and start putting it in a trash can. It could also inspire them to help out or support the cleanup. 
it looks like that something has hit the face and causing it to destroy it and to me it looks like a metor hit the face 
Your having a problem in yous relationship,and you want to work it out but you dont know whats going on. Maybe your not spending enough time with your husband or wife. So you go to a friend you can trust,and yall talk about what to do,then you go back home and work it out. 
You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, "The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do." Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture. 
1.) What is the Electoral College' A electoral college is a process, not a place. 
I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do 
However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression? 
In work talking to your boss for any reason is very difficult or scary. 
We as humans can not let fear stand in our way and give up on our evolutionary duty because we are afraid that someone else will hurt us for it. 
Luke Bomberger used to be an average teenager working two part-time jobs. Then his friend, Don Reist, came and asked him if he wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.   
so they would have to leave the team and go write back to getting worse grades agene. there parents were so proud of them and they were really starting to get there live back on track. now its all messed up. 
NASA has explored the moon and that's how far we have been and we never wen't farther than that. It's good to learn about Venus and it's ways and were it is located in our solar system but trying to put a human being on planet that has servre weather, temperatrue changes, and not the right oxygen can be very dangerous. Despiteing danger can be bad because that person will ony focus on the good things they heard about that planet and what it was like. They never focus on what the danger part of going on a such a dangerous trip. NASA should could do more reasearch on Venus before they go anywhere. It cool to strive for a new challlenge in Earth historty, but if this mission was succesful trip people will only focuse they would'nt focus on the flashbacks of putting other people that have families life on the and the have chance of dieing on g this jounrney to Venus.       
For the past few hundred years, school systems have consisted of one specific format, where students go to a place of learning and are taught by teachers. But now, with easier access to better technology, this school system is changing. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This new system has gained both positive and negative attention. 
Everything that has restriictions, or policies on drivers and their driving would be pointless and useless. 
Every four years a new president is elected to run the United states of America. Which is caried out by a process called Electoral College Process. It is a meeting of various electors,in where they vote for President and Vice President. 
they will actually want to do it, 
Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars. 
from that i experienced that you should not care only about your self but care and about others too. that is the reason that i am willing to help because i know how people need help and in many ways that is why i want to help. i know it may be a hard job but it is worth all the work. I know that it feels good 
this system of voting is unethical and not right. 
A possible cosumer concern might be that with the current model of semi-driverless cars, which still require some human effort, people may get tired or distracted waiting for their turn to drive. 
NASA took a picture "3 times bigger than the pixel size." So if there was an object like a airplane on the surface of Mars, you would be able to see what the object was. Turns out that the picture showed a butte or mesa. 
If schools are already making it stressful for students think about how it might impact on their mental health and grades 
On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions of Venus are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. However, peering at Venus from a ship or orbitting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere. 
Also that it can still be a elcetion, "it is entirely possible that the winner of the election vote will not win the national popular vote," so I believe its fair on both sides. 
Voting has been a legal write of all people since our country was established, but is the way we vote recieving some resistance? The electoral college is the way we vote now and the way weve been doing it for years. So why change it? For the sake of fairness and accuracy. 
Imagine you're on a cattle boat about to dock. You are helping by giving the animals away to poor people. Well Luke Bomberger did just that. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 time and the Pacific Ocean twice to go help peole that were stuggling. 
For example,in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote and I am sure that the african americans and the women and even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. Of course if we had the popular vote system today,the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who are excluded wouldn't like the system at all. 
Beside that reason ,it would make grading a lot more easier for teacher by having the online course do the grading for them 
That school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet 
Meeting those new people and having that special diversity will bring lots of students together and form unimaginable new bonds, friendships and relationships. 
Some people may believe that the curriculum is the most important part of school and that is why the teachers should be designing the summer projects. They would argue that some students would fail at the task of designing their own projects. 
Thus, it is possible for students to create a project that addresses important parts of the material they will learn 
Hanging out with friends, going out for a coffee, or watching a movie are among the minor things that relieve stress from the life of an average teenager. School can undoubtedly be physically and mentally draining. Therefore, spending a couple hours per week socializing and hanging with friends can help a student immensely. However, these minuscule ways of staying happy can all be taken away when a student is required to make time for an extracurricular activity 
This is one of your students at your school. 
There are a lot of great reasons to join the program. 
The electoral college is unfair very outdated and irrational. Many people today preferr that the congress changes they way voting is held other then hoping people vote for the same people you want to be president (Quote) Abloish the electoral college! ~ Bob Dole.    
I believe that students would benefit significantly from being able to attend classes from home 
From being able to pick their topic, a student accepts the responsibility to create a project and execute it over the summer. This new found responsibility can encourage a student to create a planner to organize a schedule, make sure the project is relevant and challenging, and also that they can get the project done over their break, splitting their time doing fun activities and being able to recognize ones priorities. Students learning responsibilities like these at a young age can prepare them for their future careers. Since responsibility is such a big part in everyday life as an adult it is important that students learn how to be responsible now than in the future when it is too late. 
Also if they are designed by students it can keep people off the streets. It can also bring people together and stop a lot of bullying. And when students come together they can make a big impact on the community and influence other to be smart. 
The perks of this job would be the trip and if a cow dies of old age it is a steak cook out and you can see more animals you thought possible in a bout. The sea is a inportant part of the job and if you are scard of water then this job is not for you 
Finally, I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see different people's reaction's to the situation 
Now you see why you shouldn't change the average levels. It could make a huge difference in the students and there love for the school. 
Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor 
To begin, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote. 
Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about. 
if we got everyone in our school to help by cleaning up parks, recycle and also get other people they know like friends and family to help out in the cause, it would help this planet so much. 
Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. 
Martin Luther King Jr. created a " I had a dream..."speech that explained his struggle with racism and segregation. M.L.K. Jr. wrote and executed the speech in front of a live audience on his own, later making him the leader of the civil rights movement. The speech gave him a name worldwide, everyone knew "Martin Luther King Jr."During the holocaust time period, a young Jew, Ann Frank kept a diary for people of the future so they knew what happened to all the Jews who were killed by the Germans. Her diary is now a famous book and in the Holocaust Museum in D.C. Ann Frank's diary was written herself, before that she was just one of many Jews, but because of her words, everyone know's who she is. A student-designed project would set up a teacher idea for how much their students know and help them to learn about their students. 
It's a more accurate process and who knows what people running for office has up there arm. The electoral college voting has a repeated tendancy to vote for the state of electors and that way they end up voting for the President. People prefer to vote for exactly who and what they choose to vote for and Electoral college isn't the way to go for it. What would happen when we run out of electoral votes just stick and choose a President? In what world is that fair and accurate? 
Choosing the topic allows the student to truly express themselves and talk about something they enjoy. They won't feel as if they are being forced to do a topic they do not want to do. It will allow them to speak and explain something that they are passionate about. This will later help teachers learn more about what their students are interested in. If they are doing a project on something they enjoy it is likely they will put more effort into the project to make sure it is good work and not just some garbage quickly thrown together at the end of summer. 
The Face on Mars formed to be a natural land form, so scientists told the people that there was no alien life form and that they were safe from harm. 
Second reason, i think it fair if we use our phones cause i bet all school in this world teacher use their phone that is a other reason. 
Who knows maybe some of the presidents woukd have been different because the electoral college could have changed some peoples votes. Say some wanted Obama not to be president but the state elector picked him that could be a game changer. It is suppose to be a democracy the people make the choices this is not a dictatorship. 
it gives the student control over their individual situation 
I would want you to keep The Electoral College the same for its been up to Congress and popular votes from the citizens to elect the President and Vice President all this time. If we change The Electoral College , we might end up having to change a few more things. 
I do still believe that students should design their own projects. 
I think having the most popular would be better because then most people wont get mad or cause problems because they got to say who they want so its not picked by other people stating that there opinion doesn't matter when really it does. 
The electoral college.This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United States' foundation 
The last opinion my sister got and the most important one was Beyonce. She has been a family friend for a while and my sister has always really loved her fashion sense. So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider. I think Beyonce was the best at giving her advice because she has to do it all the time with her music and what she wears for all of her performances. 
what i mean by that is most of the time no one cares about your opinion or theres and asking them for their opinion can really impact their life a lot because you probably brighten their day by putting a smile on their face. 
The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer.  
In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody 
I think it will distract the students 
Its not like we can go up there anytime we want and cheke for ourselfs! The bad thing is that we will never find out for our ownselfs but thats just the way things are! 
provide a more comfortable environment 
People in the Electoral cCollege sometimes go rouge and vote for the other party 
make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. 
If they have to work on a project that is designed by a teacher, how would they ever feel motivated to actually learn from the project that they have to do? If a student gets to design their own project, they can pick their own project that it is interesting to them, and take their time to actually learn from it. Myself for example, I learn better when I have more fun, and when I find ways to make it more enjoyable. 
I know that there are some down falls to this technology what if the student or the person doesn't have a problem and just has a face that makes it look like he/she has a problem. 
they will make transportation easier for the standard person. 
In my opinion, the development of driverless cars should be supported because of it will bring efficiency and safety for the entire human race. 
For example, if everyone did community service a lot of people will be helped. 
Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. 
Ill be sumerizing the article over venus and why it is not we can not step foot on this planet. 
why would you change that thy can't be in sports because they don't have a B average inside class that's just plane out dumb if some of the teachers say that a C' s ok then that mean a C' s ok i know your a principal and all but you must understand that most of the students with a C turn out to be a really good athlete 
it helps our school as it not only provides students with a ambition to help their city, but it shows them how good it feels to do something helpful. 
The connection of fun and learning can lead grade C average students to achieve higher grades and do better in school. 
Venus was probably coverd with large oceans and could have supported varrious forms of life just like earth. Venus still has some features that are similer to earth. Temperatures would still be very warm at 170 degrees fahrenneit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Radiation would not exceed Earth levels but survivable for humans. Old techtology called mechanical computers were first envisoned in the 1800 and played in 1940s during world war 2. It make calculations by using gears and levers and dont require electronic at all. Which on venus it will be some time intell electronic will be there 
and when you are voting for a presidentioal canodent you are actoly voting for a slate of electors. and it is posible that the winner of the elector vote will not win the populer vote. sorce richared a. posner.    
Students are not gonna be distracted by their classmates, so they can concentrate in a better way. 
In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down. 
like al gore even though he was popular he still lost the presidency. according to bradford plumer over 60 precent of voters would perfer a direct election also,how are we sure to trust the electors anyway? is texians vote on john kerry they might not lisin and vote on whoever they want out of spite 
In this case who could you blame for the accidents that occur with the driverless cars? 
The final reason is that it'll just make them feel good about themselves knowing they've helped out their community. 
This system of eletor votes is very useful for picking the country's leaders. 
i get why some people dont tell their real feelings because they might not want them to see them down. 
they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject 
The summer is a break for students to relax and not worry about school. School projects take away from that, but the student-designed projects give more flexibility than those made by teachers. Therefor, summer projects should be student-designed in order to grab students' interest and not impede on their break. 
You are deciding whether to make students perform community service or not. 
One president could be the favorite among the voters but the electors the president has to back him up with electoral votes could maybe not be as big as another presidents electors and its pretty much, in many peoples eyes, giving the least popular among the people president an easier way to become president. 
1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting while driving and in the United States over 1.6 million car crashes occur annually. That means that every year over 400,000 car accidents result from texting and driving 
We have been using the electoral college method for a long time now. It has brought us our ups and downs, but everything has it's cons. 
For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice 
From my experience helping your community will make you a better person in life and you could feel that you have done something important for your community. 
people are saying that its aliens are probably telling us to go away and that we are being watched by alleins, But in reality its just formed by natural landform and its just an illusion happening. When they launched the pictures to go up on their JPL website probabaly thounsands and thounsands of consiracy theroists thought that it was made by aleins and not by natural landform changes when they told the whole world that it was natural landform changes. 
voters can't always control who there electors vote for but they can sometimes, if they know who there electors are voting for. And they also sometimes get confused about the electors and sometimes vote for the wrong canidate 
I strongly agree that online classes would be beneficial to students, and education in general 
First, when we sent the" Mars Global Surveyor" it arrived in eghteen years in September 1997. 
Therefore, it would be best to choose Policy 1, so as to not apply a distraction to the school day, and allow students to be more social face-to-face, rather than through technology. 
From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. 
How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. This is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote. 
the elecooral college is unfair to all the U.S voters. 
The Electoral College is a great way to elect a upcoming President. The Electoral College was created by our founding fathers. The Electoral College has 538 electors. You would need a majority of 270 electoral votes is needed to elect a President. 
how it is very similar to Earth. 
disten lornin is a good idia because no all the time wi can go aut sayd or have the mauch time but tha is a good idia 
Also back then they did not have that great of cameras but now they do 
I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving. An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay. 
because is our planetary neightbor. Venus is a Earth's twin. 
When a student has depression, anxiety etc., they often find themselves unable to attend school for a full day, or even at all. Likewise, if they are present, they cannot focus and by the end of the school day, they are so mentally and physically exhausted that they cannot get their homework done. Their grades suffer as a result. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace, taking the necessary breaks when needed. The individuals would not be concerned with falling behind, because they would be able to do the work when they were mentally stable. Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses, and the act of physically going to school can be detrimental to their health, and to their grades. Online schooling would allow them to achieve a stable well-being, and a higher state of learning. 
Another reason why school have online course is that it would reduce the amount of paper. 
and are sometimes unhealthy because of the lack of exercise 
If a candidate has a regional appeal they are not likely to win. No region (South, North, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example Romney was in the South and the South has no incentive to campaign, so he gets no electoral votes. 
Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all wanted to get rid of the Electoral College. 
A lot of people perfere to drve a car because there probably too lazy or something lol, th reason they like driving because its the fastest thing to go somewere quick, 
there are numerous different groups that even pick the electors in the first place 
The electoral college are made up of human beings and they will say no to ideas they don't like. I don't think that the fate of our country should be resting on the idea that if one person doesn't like someone they will reject the idea. Obviously, the electoral college might reject some ideas just because they don't like them. 
Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with. 
Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. 
There are those who argue that phones should be allowed while driving. 
This would help the students and principals/staff in the school because they won't have to deal with the drama. 
So i think that you should make them do it but to make it more fun to make them want to come and invite friends to help. 
that what i think advantage of limited car like i said every city and county are different and have different cost.    
After school activities might give you some hard time, and might put pressure on you to do a certain something for them. 
In my opinion you should just leave the Electoral college system the way it is. 
The challenge to explor Venus is becuse Venus is the second planet from the sun so it is to hot to go to do to how close the sun is to the planet. 
The most difficult part of this project is come up with good idea to do. Coming up idea can be hard and stressful it show that student put a lot of thought into their work. While student work on their design something they think what would be great to put into their design like color if so what kind would be best, picture if so what kind,and patter. After they finish student need to check if they like it or not and they have to check if they any mistake. When you look at the work it show student put a lot of thought in their project. 
it needs to help not cause any confusion and not take away important needs in life 
"Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. 
I think we should use that technology to see students emotions 
Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most. 
First things first, only a few states have taken action towards my claim. Those being Maine and Nebraska. These states have made a "proportional representation", which is unlike the "winner take all" that the other 48 states have adopted. The text states "Most states have a winner take all method system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate" (What Is the Electoral College 
There was a study done at Workman State College where scientist studied students who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied students who actually went to school for the whole day. Both groups of students were learning the same material, the group at home got a video of their teacher explaining everything exactly the same as what she taught in class. Half of students at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home, meanwhile, the students at school had many conversations with other peers and teachers. Throughout the day, the students who stayed at home lost 10% of there overall social communication skills and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that was being taught by their teacher. This study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lessons like peer project and even just normal conversations that are experiences that can strengthen you socially for the future. 
It seems to me that it may or will cause alot more accidents than texting while driving or drinking while driving. 
In the 2000 Election Al Gore won the popular vote meaning more people in the USA wanted him at President than the winner. Should'nt we give the people what they want? A poll states thart over 60% of United States voters want to change or get rid of the Electoral College for this exact reason. The state sends people to represent the State not to represent the people. The state or people in office could totally defy whatever the people want in that state. 
Not alot of people will have good advice for what you're looking for 
In the article "The challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy to go explore from the dangers that Venus has. 
is because they don't see them as life threatening and that why some states still have fatal car accidents such as Georgia they still have fatal accidents because a lot of people have their phones in hand which causes them to swerve in the roads 
Although extracurricular activities are just as beneficial to a students educational experience as in-school classes, students should be able to have the option to choose whether they would wish to participate in the activities. 
Since this planet has a rain season and has a very windy winter, it could've been made by weathering and erosion. Another thing that makes me believe that the face is just a rock is because the dark eyes, nose, and mouth look like shadows from the camera and the sun. One last thing about the face is that if alien lifeform made this why woud they make it 2 miles wide? This has just been one side of the argument, I will write the rest. 
is a more realistic way of voting. 
Students are already required to be at school and work for 7 hours a day and 35 hours a week. The extra activities at the end of the day can add on up to 4 hours of extra time to the already long school day, making it up to 50 hours per week. Some sports practices even go until 7:30 PM and also require students to meet on the weekends. Students are already exhausted and unhappy with the current school day, and forcing an extra 15 hours a week will have a devastating effect on the previously unhappy students. 
So i look at the picture real closley and i also look at what i see in the back grown and i see all the little holes that are there 
The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well. 
There is pressure for running off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure which would complicate the presidential election process is reduced by the electoral college which produces a clear winner. 
This reading selection takes me back to my fifth grade, and everyday my friends and I would help some kindergartner's read and sound out word. Books like Green Eggs & Ham, the Cat in The Hat, even Nursery rhymes. Later, on that school when i graduated from the fifth grade me and my friends were rewarded for our help. Right now i have a cousin that just graduated from high school last year, and tutor from grades 1st-5th. He's been doing this for 6 years. Most of the kids he tutored are now in middle school and still talks about him every time I see them. 
Car use can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it, but most of the time people have strong opinions on car use. 
Being on a team, you know that people have your back during a game. After being involved with the same group of people, you start to form a bond that makes everyone so close. Having an outlet with people that you know, and are close to, can really have a positive impact on you're life. 
How do you feel about the Electoral College? Do you think that we should still keep the Electoral College or should it be changed by election of popular vote for the president of the United States? 
Community service is a good idea because it makes you feel better about yourself when you go somewhere and you see that the city is all clean. 
But, if you would like your students to try and work more efficently and coopretively, then this policy could be the right the thing to enforce in the school. 
I think we should ge rid of it because if people vote for a preident and then they dont get what they want there gonna get mad and revolt aginsit the government 
Many students might have a' C 'as an overall average, but taking away sports isn't really fair, 
There are a lot of advantages on why we should limit car usage 
you get to hear the different pieces of advice and which piece is most recommended 
They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars. 
teacher-designed summer curricula enable the student to learn and apply their knowledge suited to the general teaching style. 
Attending school from home means students can sit in bed in their pajamas and work on assignments, and the lack of interaction between students will cause them to lose their social skills. 
but a lot of the time, they don't get help with it, making harder on them self. 
Banning phones in school is the right choice because school is a place of learning. 
In addition to not using your phone in an operating vehicle there are a few reasons on why you should. Well first off the driver should not be the one to hvsicallv use the ohone ut a resoonsi le ad It should. 
my mom maybe love if i take class onlines because she work all day 
if the students at our school would help those who didn't have as much as they did then they would be more grateful for what they have and maybe think that school is a good thing because of how they could end up without it. Our school would be better if the community liked us more and we can get the community to like us if we help them. 
If we had school community service we could make Bensalem look like a better place to live. 
you could get to see many unique places all over the world. 
I think students would benefit doing school at home 
Our society's reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.Mobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver's. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence. 
Yes it might work in classes like drama club, Happy day club or other clubs but other than that i dont think sobecuasei in just a regular classroom it would be weird as i say 
Image this, Your a person who doesn't really get out much, you don't talk to that many people, and you just generally keep to yourself. Now, think about this next question I'm going to ask you. If you were like that, would you be jumping out of your seat to do an extracurricular activity? If you were in this position, you would most likely say no. For some people, they need someone to help them take that step, and get out their and meet new people 
Some people may not be able to make A' s and B' s in school so they try there best 
This self driving cars elders can still do the things they need to do such as go to the store or visit family with have to relie on other people for tranportation. 
Plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team. Plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit. There is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world. There could be no real world implication 
"Honey, could you go to the CVS and get me some nyquil.I'm dying here," mom says."Yeah, I'll be back in a bit."I grab my keys from my pocket and head outside. I unlock my new driveless car and climb in. "Take me to the CVS," I tell the car. It roars to life and backs out of the parking lot. It's been not even two miles and this thing is starting to glitch. "You will be taking possesion of this car in five minutes, ma'am," the car commands. I panic and take hold of the violently shaking steering wheel. Traffics harsh tonight meaning there's some kind of party out in town. The driveless car just unexpectedly starts going in the wrong direction, making me go in shock.Before I do a full turn I see a lady talking to her baby inside the car. I try to brake, but it just won't budge. I pray that I won't do any harm to them. Unfortunetly it does. I run smack into the front rear, making me black out. They say that before you die, your life flashes back through your eyes. But mine didn't.I instintly think of mom, dying there in her room, waiting for me to come back. But I won't and this is all because of this driveless car. 
An Electoral College is just what we need to keep the poeple safe. 
Second,"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. "So computers need to understand that, too." 
Cernaint of outcome basically decides everything because it doesnt allow to be a tie. 
I personally don't like this thing. that is because it is so outdated and unfair. 
One of the idea of NASA is to seand peolpe to Venus. People will hover throw space. In the text says"our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over may storms."In phragraph five. Flying aroud Venus is not placent. Dispice that Venuse is very hot,bing above is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is lower like the sea leveal. Resiving infromation in venus is limited becouse of how much lights it gives. We can not take anying from mars frome a distance. NASA have not founed a way to get far in to Venus. With this problem NASA takes it risky or as a challeng. 
Another thing FACS can recongise what your face is doing face. In the article in paragraph 6 it says,"if you smile when a wed ad appears on you screen, a similar ad might floow. But if you fron, the ad willl be different. "A classrom computer could recongize when a students is becoimg confused or bored"(6). 
Education like many things has had a traditional way of being however, like many things nowadays that tradition is prone to change and it is for the better. Technology is one of the most important and useful tools in todays society and schools are already utilizing it and it utilized even more so by home schoolers. Since the courses are essentially entirely online, teachers can use many online softwares to create fun, educational, and dynamic learning activities rather than simply assigning worksheets or textbook work. The online systems can help students with writing papers and with calculations in math all while explaining why things work the way that they do making the teacher's job even easier 
3 big points why the electoral college should stay the same 
NASA should stop taking photos of the face because they already have enough pictures of the face to look at. In 1976 the took a photo of the face by using Viking 1. Nasa argues that they can get better views when take new photos. critics argue that you dont need that much of photos to figure out what the face is. In 2001 they used the Viking to take a photo of the face and they got back a good photo. 
Two,this method is more convienient 
If even when we the people vote for this person and he wins with us and yall want the other guy he wins thats not fair to him or us. 
When giving the students a teacher designed project they will ,most of the time, feel very unmotivated and bitter towards it. However, if the project is being designed by the students, it will allow for the students to learn more from the project and result with more excitement, motivation, and better work ethic. Not only will the students get more joy out of doing a project they designed, but they will also be able to apply a more creative side of themselves they might have not even known they had. 
Subjects including math or science require concepts to be retained because they build off of each other. For example, it is required for students to remember Algebra 1 to succeed in Algebra 2. This sets up students for success so they are not lost when they enter the school year. Going along with that, teachers don't always have enough time in the year to go over forgotten concepts. A lot of school subjects go at a fast pace and have a lot of content to go over. This doesn't allow teachers to go over concepts from prior years. Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities. Their confidence can be damaged when they don't remember concepts from the previous year which goes into learning new subjects. This hinders their ability to succeed in school. Making summer projects student-designed will help them remember past concepts, which will increase student confidence during the school year. 
Venus used to be covered with largely oceans and may have supported various forms of life. To this day Venus has some features that are analogous to those on earth. Venus surface is a rocky sediment. Venus also has some familiar features such as valleys , moutains and craters. 
when the are may poeple that vote for ether for the republican or democratic if the oponunt has more votes they won all the electors and the oponunt does not get any votes from that state so its like you didin't even vote. 
The articles also state that no popular votes determine the election of a president 
The popular votes allows you to choose who you want to be in office and if the person you voted for lost , at least you had your vote 
Have you ever come to the conclusion that not every student can even maintain good grades at school? For some children, it's harder to balance school work and their everyday life alone, but if you add an extracurricular activity to their plate of responsibilities, it may be too much for them to handle. For a principal to make extracurricular activities a necessity at school, is not very considerate. As an adult you must realize that not every person, let alone children, can handle the same work load as others can. 
My down time was not the most important part of the trip though. 
Using online learning for a teaching method would be very useful 
If you earn a degree from a school with no accreditation, you can find yourself with a worthless degree that will leave you in debt and no better prepared for the workforce. For instance, my friends being to attend classes and he studies online or video conferencing. Some question, he doesn't understand and he has no idea to do his work. So, he has low grade in his work. We need to building relationship with your instructor and classmates will require more effort in an online environment. 
the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. 
Ive came to the conclusion that the smart car is a great idea but I dont agree with it because it just takes the fun out of learning how to drive it seems safe but wouldnt you want a driver behind the wheel that is alert? 
You can experience adventures by going over the oceas. You can slso experience adventures by taking care of the animals. This is another reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. 
Well aliens can be rule if someone makes then and sand them off somewhere but not the point. 
allowing the decision-maker to choose the best option for himself. 
Online classes are cheaper, 
it can enhance learning 
Self-motivated learning is when the student has a desire to learn and therefore works hard to learn information without having to be pushed by their teachers. The truth is that while teachers can relay all the necessary information to students, if the students don't want anything to do with it they will learn far less effectively than students who do want to learn. By asking students to create their own summer assignment, it forces them into a new learning environment in which they have to take charge of their learning. Upon being put into this position, students will have to adapt to learn how to teach themselves information. This is a very valuble life skill that will be very helpful to them later in their lives, as self-education is needed for many things that are not taught in school as well as in the workplace. Motivating themselves is an important skill that can be taught through student-designed summer work. 
In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society 
It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. 
Around April 5 in 1998 Mars global flew over Cydonia for the first time and took a better picture of the icon for we can tell what 
electoral college should not be changed to election. 
The Facial Action Codying System (FACS) can be a good thing. It could solve so many problems inside and outside of schools. It can show when you're happy, surprised, disgusted, afraid, sad, and angry. 
Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. 
By being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. 
Shouldn't the citizens of this country be the ones who get to determine who the President is? 
the electoral college is the most lamest thing 
There is no doubt that doing online school is much more beneficial then public school. 
"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states." 
Those are my reasons i think regular cars are better, and driverless cars useless if you still have to put gas in it. Now write me a essay on if you think driverless cars are better then regular cars. 
back in time they did not have spaceships 
I don't, however, believe in forcing people to do something they don't have to do. 
Community service is a great way to teach and inspire others 
If I live in a democratic state and I'm Republican, then my vote is most likely not going to count because the electors are going to vote for the other president since the state is known to be a democratic state. Then we wonder why people don't vote; it's mostly because they know which candidate is going to win that state. With popular vote , nobody knows who will win the presidency because all 50 states have equal representation. No one state will be greater than the other. 
I feel like you can't just program a computer to pick what emotions you think students are feeling,a and what if the software system was wrong and thats not what the student was feeling. 
When it comes to any type of work there is a time frame in which it needs to be completed. 
Some of the negative aspects of the driverless car are much greater in numbers than the positive. 
At lunch or in a free time the students should be talking to their friends that are on the phones contact list or to others who may not have a phone at all and not calling anyone, but their parents, for example if the student broke their ankle then the could call their parents and tell them the situation and not leave them in the dark. 
Then, littering isn't my thing i have never just threw some trash on the ground. See I feel like i' m to intelligent or well mannered to just dirty up Detroit anything our should be trying to clean up our lovely city. 
but it is stil amazing because they wont have to do much just snap a picture and thee program will caulculate it think about how many crimes this will solve . 
Studying venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our sister planet 
More and more frequently, classrooms across the country are embracing technology. From laptops distributed to the student body to 3D printers, technology changes, and education changes with it. Today, the United States is at a point where it can safely be said that, most likely, every school in the country has computers. This is an era of communication unlike the world has ever seen. Some schools even allow distance learning via online and video conferencing. A common question asked is "Is home learning a good thing?" To answer that question, not exactly. 
I think it would be best to keep the Electoral College process instead of changing it to popular demand. 
There is another group that thinks that the voteing procesess should stay the same 
Our founding fathers feared democracy, and the is why they came up with this process. 
Students should be required to clean the community 
If students lose focus, they will fail their online classes. Online classes can make it easier for students to get distracted from their objects in their home. For example, my brother failed online school because he was distracted by the TV in the room. Online classes are a easier way foe students to lose their focus. 
Mandatory community service would be a great way to aid other people. 
you travel all over the world. 
Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emothins, but it also may help produce them 
Now my opinion is that all students should participate in some sort of community services and still be able to balance out there grades and conflicting schedules. Everyone needs to be flexible, and try to help out the community for a change. It should be required, and every student should be able to handle a little community services. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
Extra credit and rewards would be a nice way to encourage more students to participate in the activities. 
The face on Mars is probaly naturally made 
the electoral college doesnt go to good for people who dont agree to their sides view 
In addition, I think the principal should require community service because it is good for the community. 
how are we going to get help without our cell-phones 
I think that it does not matter if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the AFL-CIO all want to Abolish the electoral college 
The technolgy is good for seeing emotions in paintings I can see that but, my question is if we actually except it or need it at some point. What the story says has my attention but not quite everybody's. The FAC i'll Say its not valuabe because students wouldn't be really into that maybe some will but the majority will not. The object looks like something kids need in there life to learn someting new. That will motivate them for them to do great things and try to invent other things. I just writing what I know how to right this doen't really matter because imma fail anyways but this story wouldn't really valuable why because I know our generation and if we have it in our school no one would care. I wouldn't here one person say "hey lets check out the FAC" because I know what im saying I would like to speak the truth. The story had some interstesting facts about how could detect everything from the body (Alto, page 1). 
However, while some advocate for teacher designed summer programs, schools would provide summer assignments that benefit the students more if the assignments were to be designed by students 
Another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because you have to be responsible. 
but in all honestly, almost anyone can get atleast something out of online schooling 
I feel like we should be able to bring them 
Have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you did not have to drive as much. Maybe you didn't have a car at all. A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. 
but it would be useless in a middle or high school classroom and just cause distractions. 
it also can help build self-esteem, 
from the understanding that I'm getting,  I advise everyone to take the bus,walk,skate,bike,or hike just to get to where you got to be also you could just not own a car. Because either way, if u break the rules you are going to be to be fine or  they could impounded your car and thats would be a lot of mess  becasue you paid for a car but u gotta pay the fine and pay to get your car out the impounded. So EVERYONE just walk,bike,hike,skate,or take a train or bus.    
I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on 
No matter NASA tried to say it was rock formations but no one lisitened. No one lisitened to NASA because the conspirasicy theorisits of the world were feeding the fire way too much. 
but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. 
The individual student may not realize it, but community make the place THEY live in a better society. If it didn't it would be called, world service. Everyone doing a little bit can make a big impact in our community. 
The driverless cars are said to come, but with the technology that will be invested into this project, it seems to be out of reach from those who are interested. 
However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it 
Are driverless cars good or bad? Reliable or unproductable? Can they benifit us in the future? Or will it cause danger?.For many years scientists have tested cars that can make driving alot easier for us in the near future. 
There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces. 
but i feel thatelectoral votes are confusing and should be removed from a process of electing the president. 
Lastly,the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American Wests 
But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. 
This reasoning is highly probably and has never happened before.                          
It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out. 
Studying planet that can't help us is a wate of time, finding a planet out there that have air and can grow plants is a big find and we should study those planets. The auther has claimed that Venus has a temputer of 800 degrees no person a live can live through that so that planet is the worth taking time, resources and money to go out and study. 
Reduced of car usage can save money and reduce pollution. Limiting of car usage is great idea. The resources above tells about how was the life of other countries without car. The Resouces above have proved that reduce in car use can save a lot things for life.                 
I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial. 
Student developed summer assignments are better than those developed by teachers because teachers can eliminate the burden of students who do not complete the assignment, students can connect their interests to the curriculum, and teachers can cover a variety of topics to engage students. Summer is a time for students to relax and take a break from the heavy workload of school. However, it is also important for students to stay engaged by previewing course material for the upcoming school year. Although there are clear benefits to summer assignments, many students decide not to complete them. Teachers have to deal with an annual burden of students who do not complete their summer projects. This burden can easily be eliminated by changing the summer assignment to accommodate for students 
students may not make their summer projects challenging enough to learn new concepts. 
A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. if our sister planet is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface 
People shouldn't be able to use phone while they're driving, but at the same time people need their phone in case of an emergency. Or if their job requires using their phone and driving at the same time they'll have to use their phone 
for example like an ocean or a mountain he alos said there could even be some type of life form that could live there. 
Every kid does community service every day without even knowing that they are doing it. 
because they are more distractions 
What i think the author is trying to say is that Venus is very much like earth 
Therefore, if this porgram would be able to help kids to be more interested in a topic and be more involved, they may just have improved grades from this system. 
I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. 
That is why we must take action into our own hands to give the students at this school of learning an understanding of why we should stop littering. This school is already dirty why make it dirtier than it was before 
As a result, students are busy after school, students are exhausted from long school days, and students are not interested in the activities at school are all reasons why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. Students have lots of other things to do after school, students want to go home after a long 7 hours of school and do not want to be at school for another 1 to 3 hours, and lastly students are not interested in the extracurricular activities at school because they are boring.                               
Most people would argues that allowing students to have their cell phones would be a distraction well no not really 
Its important to do what is nesessary. 
allow students to share a topic that they find interesting. 
They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more . What im thinking is there had to have been a storm or strong wind for face one to be so blury. 
A lot of kids don't follow the rules at school but maybe if you let them have the privilege of having their phones they will end up becoming more responsible. 
the advantages of limiting car usage is that it helps the envirorment to stay healthy, help bring people together and make them more active by taking bikes, skates, and ect. and also cars have harmful chemicals, and gases that is bad for the air we breath. 
I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system 
him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work . 
This is all the evidence on why Venus is worth discovering dispite the dangers while, Scientists may have discovered a bit of Venus and a bit of Mars unfortionatly for now some of those planets remain a mystery while some are on the very peak of changing from the unknown to the discoverable. 
the law doesnt allow us to try things out with these cars 
because In the text it states that venus is actually a planet and venus is the second planet from the sun. The text also states that venus is simple to see from a far distant. Finally, it says that numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study in etc. If you look back in paragraph 1& 2 that's where I got all the information from to support my answer. 
However, when others also understand your situation, it is a lot less of a weight to carry. Talking to more than one person can help relieve the stress a lot more than if it is carried by only one or two people. For instance, I was very stressed about an upcoming competition and I could not focus on studying. I explained my situation to many of my friends and they helped me calm down and gave me advice on how to focus and study. Getting advice from many people helped me relieve my stress and do well at the competition. I felt more calm because of the support from my friends after getting advice. Making sure you are not stressed is very important because it could affect your studies and relationship with friends and family. By asking more than one person for advice, you will most likely be less stressed. 
Most people are either passive aggressive or just aggressive and this can change the way they do things. With my problems I tend to be more passive aggressive, because I don't like arguments or confrontation, but most of my friends are the opposite. In times where I would normally not do anything until it becomes a big mess, my friends would already haven confronted the situation a long time ago. That was some reasons why asking others what they would do can help you come up with what you should decide. 
taking multiple opinions into consideration is beneficial to all of us. 
To be able to land and survive on Venus, we'll need to find and test new or old technology. 
Asking for multiple opinions is a probably the best way to find out how to choose the best choice because all opinions matter. 
Also it says under nthe electoral college system, votes dont vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. 
Not only do online classrooms lack certain aspects necessary for a student to survival in the real world, but they also lack the accessibility of help when a student needs it. 
This can tell you if a person is lying or not, along with a couple other factors. 
By understanding and experiencing the challenges the class faced before and during the school year, The upperclassmen would be able to create a better summer assignment for the new students. throughout school, not only have i sought out upperclassmen, but underclassmen have came to me asking for advice on classes or help studying. Students for a bond with one another, despite the grade level, in order to survive in the educational ecosystem. Unlike teachers, students know what they need in order to succeed as well as regrets and mistakes they will urge the underclassmen not to do. What else would be better in helping new students for the year than a guided assinment created one of their own? 
And instead of ads they could be explanations on how to do a problem. 
through more direct, one on one learning with teachers 
The author backs up his or her point by saying how "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." The fact that at one time Venus might have been covered in water has convienced me that there is some sort of way to create life there. Not only does he or she mention how Venus might have once been covered in water, but also informs the audience that Venus has many Earth-like structures. Venus is made up of mountians, valleys, and craters. 
there are many important decisions you have to make in life. In order to make the best choice, you should consider many opinions. I say this because some people have more experience than you, everyone has a different opinion, and you can compare those opinions. Your point of view is not always going to be the best point of view. With that being said, if you seek multiple points of views, you will have the knowledge to make the best choice possible.  
I think we should change the elction to popular vote 
I do think it's a neat idea and a cool project that needs alot of time, and developement, but i dont wan't all human task, and responsibilties taken away. I don't wanna see the world turn into nothing, but robots, and automated machines. I want to see cool things, that are fun, and make life a little bit eaier, but still allow us to have do do things. Thats just my personal opionon.    
the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile while it shows how much this computer can do,imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad, thatll be really creapy once it knows how you're feeling. 
For example in paragraph 6 it says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" Dr. Huang predicts . "Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ." That is what the teacher is here for to modify the lesson if the student does not understand the assignment . Why let a computer take over ?  
Every year hundreds of thousands of people are killed in car accidents.Many of those accidents are a result of neglegence on the fault of the driver.Driving while under the influence, driving and texting, driving and making calls, driving and eating, driving and putting make-up on; all are things that cause car accidents that could be avoided with driverless cars. With driverless cars, passengers would be able to go on the road and not have to deal with the stress that comes with driving around on busy roads, or the stress that comes with taking into consideration bad drivers, other people driving under the influence, or just other drivers in general. 
your not alone on this trip if you want company 
It is the electors that elect the presidents, not the people. But each party selects a slate of elector's trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral votes doesn't win the popular votes. This happened in 2000, when gore had more popular votes, but yet he had less electoral votes than George Bush. 
Students who take classes online or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who have a busier schedule. 
Venus is considered the most comprable planet to our own, Earth. It is the closest in size and density, and sometimes the closest in distance too. There have been many attempts to explore Earth's "twin" with unmanned spacecrafts, but none have ever survived after the first few hours of landing on Venus. 
On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take another picture of the face,And this time the scientists angled it perfectly so they had the best possible picture to stop all the non-sense about the face on Mars. They took the picture and enhanced it three times the size. 
As you can see, there is no reason to change it so that the president gets his votes by poularity. 
their are some bad things about having projects during the summer but mainly bad things. Their are a lot of good things about having no projects in the summer. During the summer it should be for the students to have fun and not worry about school. The summer is a time when students should have to worry about school or test or projects being due. Im going for no projects during the summer they mess so many plans up.     
Students would also be able to get more sleep which can keep them awake and aware of the lesson they are learning. 
If students decide to clean up the community then they should be able to do it 
In conclusion, you get help. You get to have fun. Last but not least you ge to see a lot of amazing places! So, to sum it all up... you will have a blast if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.     
Well, you can awlays WALK to the public transportation area. Studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This leaves us wondering, "Has Obama passed peak driving?" 
my position on driverless cars is that cars should just be left alone. 
By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts 
Secondly, video conferencing with distance learning from home is not advisable and great because it brings distractions 
The electoral colleges has been an american tradition for hundred of years 
Other times the state conventions, the presidential candidates, and sometimes the sate party's central committee. Voters think it's unfair. They spend a bunch of time voting for who THEY want, but in the end it comes down to the electors. So in reality it doesn't even matter who the voters choose. They really just choose a slate of electors, who then elect the president, 
Reasons why I think it wouldn't be a good idea because in the text in paragraph six it says that "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus". In my own words I believe it is not safe because what if it doesn't last long ? 
We don't have anywhere else to go if we keep killing earth 
When it comes to summer projects, teachers should be the ones designing them. They are specialist in learning and know what further steps students need to take to learn. With the teachers clear design instructions and guidance, it will make summer learning much easier and efficient. Teacher designed projects aren't just helpful for students but teachers as well. When grading or examining the projects, that they designed, it will be easier for them to grade and compare to other students. So when in comes to whether summer projects should be either student-designed or teacher designed, teacher-designed is the way to go and will assure a continuation of learning during the summer break. 
A good reason for this is for advertising. 
Luke signed up for the program just to experience what the journey would be like and his friend asked him then they would have to ride with different kinds of animals like horses. Luke made nine trips and was brave to make that choice. But lukes friend decided to invite luke on this trip so luke was pretty glad that his friend invited him. then luke and his friend were asked to take care of horses,young cows,and mules.Luke then decided to take his traveling a whole new level especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Luke decided to play games on board like basball,volleyball,table tennis he was also fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. well being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. Luke had so much fun being a seagoing cowboy. and leading his family hosts a number of international students and exchange vistors for many and many years so when people bring up seagoing cowboys they can remenber that it is a jorney 
because what if the computer and sensors randomly short out or they mess up and send the car into a telephone pole, tree, ect. 
This will keep them interested in the project which will make all the grades of the projects go up compared to if it was a topic they have no interest in. 
Other than that popular vote is much more sufficient than Electoral vote because its much more fair and with popular vote everyone votes on who they want to vote and every state gets the same, equal treatment as the others. 
"A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does." Every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state, and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions. 
This would give them an opportunity to research something that they don't already know anything about.Often students cannot pursure their interests because of all their other responsibilities.Many students cannot take the classes that they wish to take becuase they have other classes that they are required to complete in order to graduate.Becuase there is no determined subject of the project, the students will have the rare chance to research whatever they want to.This could even be a time where the students could learn something that is not taught in school at all. This also applies to classes that they may be taking that they do not do many projects in.This would give them the chance to use and display the knowledge that they already have.Similarly to the style of projects, upon seeing all of the topics that interest the students, the teachers may be inclined to add some of the topics to their curriculum, which would once again encourage the students to be more interested in their classes.When one student is interested in something, it is more than likely that other students will be the same.Though it is important for students to work with topics that are already somewhat familiar to them, it's also very important for students to step outside of their comfort zone into something entirely new.When a student begins learning about a topic with an open mind and a goal to learn, they may find more than a project, they may find a passion.It's very important to allow students to explore new interests while still in highschool.Being in the smae routine for years may put a student into the mindset that they should not change what they are already doing, or it could even discourage students from pursuing new interests.It is important that students find these interests so that they will have an idea of what they want to do when they go to college, or when they step out into the world as adults. 
I have mentioned before, I am taking an online class. I decided to take this class for the following reasons: to experience online school and see if it was adequate for me and to get this class done this year so I could focus on more specific subjects my senior year in high school. I started the course through a platform called vision used by Generic_School, which is both an in-school class resource and a online class tool. As far as I have been experiencing this new learning format, I have found many advantages to it. The course i'm enrolled in is self-paced, meaning I can do my work when suggested or work ahead if I have the time, which I have had. This doesn't happen often to me because I always find myself stressed during school hours, not thinking of learning and working ahead, but thinking about the time I can get our of the school's campus and go home. This is something thousands of students in this school had felt or are feeling. I have made a research paper describing how decoration and lighting in a classroom affect significantly the learning process of anyone at any given time. This occurs because many schools, including mine, have pure white lights and walls which can induce anxiety, stress and overtime help mental health problems appear or worsen depending on the person 
venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. 
There are so many positive things on why to keep the electoral process and I also make room for the errors of it so dont think im on a one man train,because im not 
If they text in class they could be texting their friends telling them the answers and that is called cheating. Cheating is really a wrong thing to do, it shows what you know not your friend. Major consequences are handed out to cheaters that can cause them to fail or suffer in their career choices. Therefore cheating is prohibited. 
they know what they have truly learned rather than what teachers assumed they have been taught by other teachers, 
The electoral college is described in many ways. It is described as needed, useful and helpful 
Certainty of outcome can help 
I went to play basketball and i had a blast it was fun to play with my friends and me However, let's say you don't like basketball and you would rather prefer Track You can do that! track can help you in different ways like your running. Track is also entertaining as well There is also football who does not enjoy football it is a sport that i love to watch,play etc football is a excellent sport because 1 It can make your body healthy and fit. 2 If your extremely good at the game you can make a lot of money off it. thats why you should play sports. 
Luke's participation in the progran hays allowed him to experince adventures and visits to many unique places. 
Plus it would help reduce our garbage near and around roads, highways, schools, homes, work places, and public areas which would help make a big difference. If you recycled everything you picked up then you would be reducing greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere and making a small step towards a green planet 
Even so, that was the first time since 1888, as said in paragraph 16. 
Who knows if Mars has erosion or layers under it's surface that is able to move? 
If you look at these three images you will notice over the years we have been able to unblur this image and it shows there is no face on Mars. 
It's a week before your junior year starts. You're laying in bed, soaking up your last few days of freedom. Then it hits you- you have a book report due the first day of school. Panic sets in, chaos erupts. Oh, the joy of summer projects. Most students have been through the process of completing a summer project. In most circumstances, these projects are a strict set of directions created by the teacher. Summer projects are expected, especially when taking difficult classes. 
Some peolpe don't like it mabye it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is to scared to show they're depress and they rather keep to them self. 
Most students have a C GPA lower of higher. My opinion on this idea is good and bad. 
The atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus.on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than waht we experience on our own planet. 
I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said ", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor "sleeping". 
mainly people just want someone who is willing  to make the right changes. Like i said the leader's main goal is to get people to agree  and make them think that you are worth for the job. No one will appreciate someone making the laws without people agreeing the people would be furious and the word freedom wouldnt exsist anymore in the country. Freedom is all about peoples rights 
teacher-designed projects would be more efficient regardless since it could be more helpful to teacher because it could be based on exactly what the teacher wants to know about what the student knows to help them succeed for the rest of the school year. And most summer assignments are different depending on the class too. If a student is going into a class they've never taken before, how could they make up a student-designed summer assignment to help them when their teacher could just give them a direct summer assignment as a jump start for the school year. 
In summation, schools should implement distance learning as it serves as a vital benefit to students who genuinely cannot gain from traditional forms of education. By allowing for flexible schedules, distance learning provides a feasible alternative to students who cannot perform their tasks within the confines of traditional schools. By encouraging independence, distance learning empowers students to learn discipline and organization in addition to traditional academia. Knowledge is indeed power, and with the knowledge that educators have about distance learning, they must now enable students to experience first hand how distance learning can benefit them. 
"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." 
In addition, if teachers continue to design the majority of the students summer time projects, consequently, the project assigned will be either completed to its minimum rather to its maximum, and not to mention the overall quality would definitely be dramatically decreased 
When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time. 
and no one state has more of a say. 
They would make students more overwhelmed with homework 
This letter is to inform you of the idea of requiring students to perform community service. Community service is a good was to show others how our school wants to help out in our community. 
I think this is the correct option because, while at school a student's mind should be on the work he or she has been assigned and the job of keeping his/her grades up. 
Students preffer to do their work at home because they can finish it more faster that in the school. therefore in the school there is a lot students who just go to the school for play and joke,whitch cause other to not do their work. it make other students get distration by other. futher in the school there is always conflict how other students dress,and some make bulling to other. So, take classes online at home is more benefit to all students who want to graduate from the school. As soon as posible. 
In conclusion, community cleanup is a good idea. For one it will look good on kids diploma for college. It will also make more respected by adults and children. Lastly it will help make roads and sidewalks clean to walk on and no flying debris. 
which is a great idea. 
On April 8th, 2001 Cydonia became cloudless. And it was easy for NASA to see the mysterious face. 
The National Safety Council reports that, "answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field." Anything can happen while you're driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road. Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel. 
and in one specific case, it is. In the 2000 presidential election, between Al Gore and George Bush, Al Gore got more popular votes than George Bush; he should have won. But Bush had more electoral votes, and that was where is mattered. So, Bush won that. If Gore won popularity wise, he should have won, hense creating happier citizens, since he won the majority of their votes. 
According to the passage"What is the Electoral College" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral college is a process, not a place. This means that it is not in a certain place it is all over the United States.  The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualififed citizens.  The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
Being in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. 
If a student excels in a sport, he or she should not be limited to access of achieving their goals in this sport because they are not at a high academic level. Limiting their ability to participate in what they excel in can take away many opportunities. For example, one of your students has the skill to play on a professional sports team, but unfortunately they are not allowed to participate in sports at school because they have a C average. A C average today in math class doesn't determine their future as a MVP. 
Citizens votes should be the votes counted for electing presidents and not couted for electing electors 
Dr Huang was a smart person in the facial expressions he was the one that was trying to found out things about the human communication for technolgoly. 
summer assignments for math tend to review previous subjects that will be used for a harder math course and will help expand on this knowledge. A summer assignment that I have done is one for Precalculus with Trigonometry that not only reviewed previous math skills but expanded on them which helped to prepare me for the course. Students have voiced that these projects are too hard and can never finish them in time. That is why assignments are given at the beginning of summer to allow exponential time to do them and are made in a way to teach and prepare students for what they will learn in a harder course, making an easier assignment will not be beneficial for these reasons. Summer projects can be made with different variations, having them based on a teacher's plans allows for an preparedness and an expansion of skills. 
To wrap everything up, the single best arguement agains tht eelectoral college is what we might call a disaster factor. 
Some good things about online classes you can get on when you want you can be out of town and still have the option to get on 
I think that the electoral college should have less power, but not be totally rid. 
The Face was originally discover in 1976, by the photographers aboard NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In the picture taken in 1976, you can clearly see a face in the landform. But in the picture taken in 1998, the atmosphere was extremely cloudy, so if there was any indention in Mars's base, you couldn't see it because of the clouds. Because of this, scientists went out on another attempt to capture a good image of The Fcae on Mars, and they succeeded. 
NASA has had the Mars Global Survayor fly over Cydonia and take pictures to prove it 
NASA has came up with a ¨solution¨ of the problemof gaining knowledge of Venus which is for a vehicle to hover over Venus and scientists would safely observe the planet that way. 
What it is just a landform that has formed to look so simular to a face or moument of the martians. But mars is like earth it forms things just like it so what it really is is just a couple of rocks and thier shadows to form a face like thing. 
In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future. 
Next this brings me to is emergencies 
Voters should be alowed to directly vote for who they want to be president and not rely on the lectoral college.    
"The electoral college requires for a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal." 
students would not be given the chance to develop certain social skills necessary for their success in the real world. 
What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there. 
Second of all, if we were able to use our phones in lunch periods or free times then what will be the point of students getting in trouble all the time because of cell phones. 
Can you emagine being able to use this like for more than just polotitions like maybe the presedent or a school teacher a dilinquent or maybe even a spouse. 
they have more time 
Do I believe this is a good idea? Yes 
The other thing about the electorial vote is that who are the electors? who picks them? 
cause they aren't doing any work just relaxing with friends and eat talking also catching up with old friends so at that time they can also use there cell phones. 
Other people do not need to know what is wrong with you, rather you are upset, sad, angry or happy. 
The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. 
Another good reason would be that we would be helping the environment, 
all of us need some advise at some point in our life. We ask for advise to get through rough times, bad situations, and even life itself. 
In conclusion, Venus is interesting, helpful, amd safe. Venus has been tested out and has been experimented on. By the experiments people can tell whether its safe or not. After finishing the passage, Venus is an environment which everyone would enjoy. 
Cellphones have advanced a lot in many years from flip phones to smart phones but as the years have gone by we have come more and more addicted to them and its causing a problem to us humans especially when it comes to driving us humans are at fault for driving and causing accidents on the road due to our cellphone addiction. 
I feel like people don't want to show they feelings a lot of people want keep things to they self. 
Community service has been part of many peoples lives in this world. Many people do community service to help others and better this world. 
Luke reason he joined the program was because he had two part time joby and his friends where going and they asked him if he wanted to go. And Luke could not say no so he went. And he would be missing an opportunity in his life time. Lukes 2 part time jobs where working at a store and a bank.It was 1945 world war 2 Luke and Don signed up to feed the animals. They has to fees 335 horses. They also had to feed cows, and mules that they had to feed.It was August 1945 , The boys just recived their order reports to new Orlans.Luke is now 18 year sold Luke said that they had a sight seeing of Europe and China. It took 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. And It took a month to get to China.Luke surved as a night watch man. He had to feed the animals every hour. So that way they did not have to starve. And cry all night for food and water to eat and drink.A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.He was happy to be alive. But he couldnt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.Luke also found time to have fun and he got to play volleyball, table tennis,boxing and fencing but this happend after they unloaded the animals then they got to have fun and enjoy their time.Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and he crossed the PAcific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2.                                                 
Help with the winner-take-all system, it just the oppisite of it. 
So yes i do think that students should be helping out by picking u garbage so ti can help the community and help the planet and make are school a little more better than what it is. By helping the community i think that we can make the environment around the school better such as other places at home. 
but, studies showed that a lot of students who got their education online had a hardtime adopting into the colleges. 
Yes , the Facial Action Coding System is needed for schools and worth spending some money on for schools all over the world 
I don't believe that aliens are real 
I do not agree that all students must participate in a extracurricular activity because not all students have the time to deal with a extracurricular activity, and students have less time in their regular classes. 
If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college. 
As everything else in life, there can be a good outcome. I believe learning about what is surrounding us outside of Earth is very important. Not only will we be infromed, but there has been said that there was life in Venus almost as much as we have on Earth, they don't call Venus "Earth's twin" for simply no reason 
everyone should know how they feel that day or how the felt becuase we might be able to help them. it can also see mixed emtions for example in the artical it said " the software can even identify mixed emtions". it saying we can see if they are feeling happy and mad or sad or mad together. it can identify what feelings are going in together. 
Electoral collage is not a bad option but Im in favor of voting by popular vote for the president of the United State . 
like the whole nixon thing,and Kennedy pretty much cheated on his wife with Marlyn Monroe. but,this can be stopped just with a simple petition to get rid of or change the electoral college. then,this could stop some presidents before agreed with me like Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole, and groups like the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO according to source 2. Al Gore didn't win because of the electoral college,even though he won the popular vote! 
The evedence that supportes this artical is when its talking about how NASA is getting involved 
For example, a teacher can design a project for mechanical engineering, biology, political sciences, Algebra 2, or more, allowing multiple choices for the student to choose. Also no matter what project design a student receives, the topics will be broad, giving space for creative thinking. The teacher-designed projects won't just give students space for creative opportunities but also flexibility with their decision. 
Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968- these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World- the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representitives- without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy? 
the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. 
I would keep the Electoral College because it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
Hi my name is PROPER_NAME and I work for NASA discussing with someone who thinks that the face was created by aliens 
Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks "in the dark!" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with "2020 Vision Software", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology 
I think it would also be alot nicer if they could get around that stuff on there own too. 
Keeping the Electoral College in order to elect our president every 4 years is certainly the best idea. You see an electoral vote is technically a voice for the people of the state depending on the population of the state. Many states are large in size meaning that opinions, beliefs, and needs are not all the same. That's where the Electoral College comes in, they voice the votes. 
cause a better environment, 
In the article it states"Some people think the Face is Bona Fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists." People think there is life on Mars. They dont believe that the face is a natural land form. Many people I bet still wonder how it got there 
The Electoral College is right but not fair, althought it has its benifets, its has its defaults as well 
some people are blind,handicap etc Those people have really problem to walking , who can;t walk this distance learning help you every single movement of your life. these all are the benefit of distance learning which is provided from school. i am positive for distance learning education because it its best way of study theroritacaly and practically. sometimes doesn't have answer when you need but distance learning have a different types of answer form. distance learning t is not only for handicap people it is good and beneifitablefor everyone small kid to youngest people all over the world. so i am positive with distance learning. 
Technology has given education a new pathway for young people to learn and grow their future due to distance learning; however, taking classes from home is not as beneficial as learning in school 
Driverless cars have the potentiol to drastically reduce fuel usage. 
I also do agree with the other side of the argument. I agree with the other side because like me many people are very busy with school already 
Then they can choice what will be most beneficial to our country and what will in the long run help our great state and country as well. 
FACS can be used in school for knowladge. 
Obama recived 6.1 percent from the electoral vote and 51.3 percent for the poplar votes. It was an uncertain vote because the college don't know what the people would pick as a result. but many people think that it should be like that because they are voting for a slate of elector and not for president.(sourse 2) 
When you get older in life and you need a job or you want this collage to want you, then having community service will look good on your application for the collage/job 
Already there is many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades. 
or something make happy that person, like in the artticle say " In fact, we humas perform this same impressive " calculation " every day . For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." this mean that most people can show feelings on their face. Of course some people have trouble to describe faces because some people doesn't show feelings and other do. 
distance learning can still cause major problems when you actually look at it. Home schooling, distance learning or whatever you want to call it is really allowing are kids to be lazy when it comes to learning. We are literally giving our kids a crutch right before our eyes and we don't even see it. 
We used mechanical computer in 1940s dring World War II. Scientest think that we can make the parts immune to Venus's harsh conditions. They could be made to resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. This is one of the of projects that will hopefuly beat Venus's challenges. 
The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates 
Online learning would provide a more preferable environment for learning, which in turn, will reduce stress and improve general moral. 
If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new. 
After reading the article called, "Making Mona Lisa Smile". And about how there is a machine that can actually read peoples emotions and put their emotions into percentages. And how they used it to find out how the Mona Lisa was feling when she was painted i think that is truly amazing. 
online classes are an additional option for students to take. 
Online classes are a huge benefit that provides students who are sick with an opportunity to keep up with their school work while not putting others at risk. 
People that learn from home do not know what is converse with people around them, 
It can help senior citizens and young children and people with disabilities.It also could clean up some community parks or playgrounds.But mostly I would just stick on making a club for volunteers.That's some of my reasons for not making community service a required activity to pass school. 
In conclusion, I think we should change the electoral vote to the popular vote because the majority of the voters should get what they voted. I think it is unfair for all the people that vote and does not really do anything unless there is tie in the electoral vote. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational to all the people.     
Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. 
Many of the projects that I have done were mostly teacher-designed and they were easy to understand and finish without too many hurdles. If there were to be any confusion it would be much easier to contact the teacher about a question than a student. When there are less mistakes in the project it would be more time effective and one would be able to finish the project faster. 
Driverless cars are another one of the world's technological marvels, that not only take away the prevalent nuisance of driving for long periods of time, but in terms of safety and efficiency, prevail. 
With only a few hundred electors a rich person could bribe them into choosing who they wanted and it could be someone who got no votes. It is unfair this country has 100s of millions of people and to leave it up to 370 people is proposterus. 
Just for 40 minutes (lunch) of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time. 
For example, one student may not be able to color, paint, or draw, while another student is really good at coloring, painting, and drawing. The student who isn't as good at doing those things, may be better at using computers to create things. So that student should be able to complete his/her summer assignment, on his/her terms. Some teachers assume that all students are capable of doing only one thing, which is very untrue and unrealistic. Students should not be limited to doing one thing, in one way. It's unfair that some teachers grade based on how artistic the assignment is, or how technological it is. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Teachers should look towards all their students specific strengths, instead of aiming at their weaknesses. Plus, teachers should be very fond of students' creativity in their assignments, and grade them based on the student's hard work, the assignment criteria, and their creativity. 
The ride would be long 
Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city (Source 2). Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there  were about 4,000 drivers fined (Source 2). It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals (Source 2). This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better. 
people who have voted for many years would have to learn about this new voting system 
They have everything, they have all information for us to look up if we need which very helpfuf our works, and it makes our work become easier. From he text states, "'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts." 
it is unfair to the other elector becuse they have no chance of winning the election. 
To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. That's why i would never change them for one computer at home.  
My seconed reason by reading the article it can change feelings. 
Second how much does it cost? Is it the same to build it as much as a lamborigini or as much as a pencil? Third, how long does it take to build it. And how long does it last for. 1 minites or 3 hours. How long does it scan for. 
The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back. 
The cost and risk of exploring Venus is not worth the infromation we would achieve. 
There are many people who believe that it is the better way to go about things given that the electoral college is a waste of time or so some may say. 
In my opinion this is a great idea. 
i think we should do community service don't you? 
I understand that one believes that by not allowing students to participate in sports or other activities will limit their focus to school work, therefore allowing more time towards education 
People make up lies and stats all the tiime to get where they want but the never do good. Let me put it this way would you like someone taking care of your faimly whale your away driving your car, kissing your wife making the dissions then when you get back you act like it does not happen? No you would probable freak out yeah. You spend years makeing these system and trying to let the people be what they want but systums like these do not help on any level. 
If you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once). 
Who are the elcators who voted for him? Who are the electors at all? Well that's something for the state to decide. The state picks up to three people to be the speakers for those states. 
A well known student at Generic_School, with above average grades, had chosen to take Physical Education online. Due to the unfamiliar feeling of the absence of a teacher in her presence, she received a D in the course. This shows that without having a teacher in one's physical presence, it is very easy to get lost. Compared to attending a real high school, online classes have less resources in times of confusion. Real high schools have thousands of students and near a hundred teachers who may help preventing one from getting lost, while virtual classes have maybe fifteen reliable sources. 
Mercury is closer to Earth's sun, yet Venus is the highest temperature planet in the solar system. This temperature has presented many difficulties trying to put a person on the planet. Landing someone on Venus has not been succeded yet. Many scientist and astronomers are working on creating a spacecraft that will hold together, although all of the dangers that are presented 
Scientist are interested in exploring Venus but they find it very hard to explore it. Venus has high temperature that make it harder for them to be able to get a closer look at it which makes it a challenge for scientists for to even get a closer look at it. If Venus is Earth's sister planet why is it so inhospitable for us to live in it. 
This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, "Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote." What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it. 
because they have to call your parent when the school is end at 3:50". or if you a emergency u cant call your parent 
Vehicles without human drivers is the next big thing in society. 
I think because, some students are silent and this option help you. 
Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? 
But it's really dangerous in Venus. 
Students could enjoy their summer with this project because they are doing something they're passionate about. This will benefit students because they tend to put more effort into something they want to do. Also for students doing something they want to do, they strive to succeed and they'll choose something that they're comfortable with. In addition students could still enjoy their summer because of the stress it takes off of the student for them not having to go out of their comfort zone to complete another project subject that they have no clue about. The stress taken off students for the summer is beneficial because it gives them an energetic start to the next school year. 
When people place their vote they belive they are putting in a vote for the president they choose, not for a slate of electors. 
i am saying this b. cause we have all day with our phone. 
Sure it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may not be the best way of geting potential voters for a candidate, 
When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. The Electoral College has a better chance of having an outcome than the popular votes. " 
In conclusion the computors reading emotions are a best idea in time and only time will tell if we can create artifitial intellegence to the computor for the best in the world. 
So we don't hurt our planet, animals, and other things like our population . 
NASA whats to get information about Venus. 
Yes, sometimes people do not know what they are voting for and why, but that is because we have no say, it is not up to the people who is going to the president of the country of we live, because the electoral college will not let us choose who we want. 
are being dishonest 
Asking for multiple inputs for the topic of advice, hits very close to home for me.After I moved from the United Kingdom to United States of America.I was sad and had the feeling of anxiety of talking to and meeting new people as I had made so many friends in the UK and no one in America wanted to talk to be or be my friend.I felt like I wasn't meant to be in this world, but then my dad took me into our formal dining room and sat me down.I talked to him about the whole situation and told him about my worries and asked him for advice.He gave me advice on how to cope and to deal with situation.I had suddenly felt a lot better.I then started to be more open about my feelings and talked to multiple people like my school consular, mom, brother and even a classmate.Now I have a lot of friends that I can rely and depend on because of the advice I took from multiple people.Therefore, asking for advice from more than one person can change or have a huge impact on someones life. 
For example, if a child had a sports elective before his final math exam, he could use the sport to distract himself from being nervous. Once he got to his next class, he was not nervous, and he did well on his test. Performing non-scholastic activities can help performance in scholastic activities. 
The Electoral College also avoids the disaster of which no cadidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A good example of this is when Clinton had only 43% of the popular votes won, yet he got a whopping 370 electoral votes, which made him president. 
Your phone could get stolen.You could get it confiscated.If phones get stolen there will be accusations and there will be some students who would fight because of those accusations.There could be more fights and stolen properties and parents would get upset and they could press charges to the school or the person who stole the phone. 
The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. My question is "Why not use all of the electors votes instead of using only anout 55% of them?". We say that every vote counts but if we are not using all of the electoral votes then that means we are just contradicting our statement. 
So if i was you i would start exercising early so I can be haelty when im older. My princeipal has decided for all student's would have to participate in one extrourrieular activity. In if you do not participate in one of the extourrielur activity you would get in big trouble with the princeipal. I do agree for these so student's would start getting in shape in really healthy. 
in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year. 
If Venus is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing visits to its surface. Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may have been much like earth long ago. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallies, mountains, and craters.Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the the planet itself. also because human curiosity will likelylead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
the student wouldn't have enough sleeping time 
Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, less worries, and the best of all. . . SAVE MORE MONEY! 
A popular vote can be a better source of election because it gives the people of the state a better chance to express themselves and have a free, independant country. 
please reconsider changing your policy of our grade average. 
Although there are people who have the belief that working from home isn't actually a job because you aren't considered to be working; 
And the teacher should have that technology to help student 
It should just be up to the citizens to chose who runs for president so that way there isnt such big arguments over who became president. 
I even think that that we could not live there in Venus cuse of the climates. 
The Electoral College is fair to everyone 
this story was about diffrent plantes and how eveything is set up also hoe everything be taveling in the earths eveviorments a ns solar systems. 
Also, the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. 
This all leads to concluding that the author made a most valid statement and provides evidence that provides wonderful reasoning as to why scientists should explore Venus and the benefits the exploration would provide.    
With these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. Another quote that can support my claim is that "Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication," "so computers need to under stand that, too." What this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them. 
No, the author did not evaluate his idea good enough there wasn't enough supporting details to support his claim "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents". 
Dear state senator, I am wriitting you this letter to argue about removing the Electoral college. 
and seem, even now, to be going out of style. 
You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation 
Some students, need go school for the understand better. Some students need go school because if they are stay in home and they want home schools maybe in not listen to teacher or make copy. For friendly some people is unsocial and need make friend in school. Ithink school good option for this studnets. 
as it helps foster creativity 
I do understand that there are students who just don't understand the work, 
The only problem i can see by allowing this is if you drop your phone, leave it somewhere, or its been stolen. 
Also, because in paragraph 4 it states that "Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit" 
A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a "Web ad appears" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are. 
There are consequences to driving with a person on his or her phone but in some states they should not even if there should be. 
The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. 
The thing i disagree with is the car driving by itself because if that does evolve to regular society, then I think we will have something else to deal with. 
No, that is not entirely true. A way to fix this predicament is to have consequences and tutors. 
Lets say someone is being asked a couple questions, if they asked the person if he broke into a house recently they can tell if his stress levels are high. 
allow them to also prioritize hobbies and passions 
Next, the author gives possible ways to study Venus safely, and effciently. 
I believe that community service is extremely important and that all students should be required to perform some community service. 
When i was little they used to tell me that you learn something new evertyday and they were righty i leaen morwe and more everydsy that the electoral cvollege is unconsitional in my eyes 
I think that you need put off the Electoral College,and let the people pick for the presidents that they want. 
They are some Schools offer for Students to Lerning as option for Students from home 
The act of physically going to school does not benefit everyone, therefore, online learning would be a beneficial option. Distance learning would still allow for those to achieve an education, but in a more peaceful environment. It would allow students to spend more time on their work since travel time is cut out, and would also permit those to have a balanced life as they spend time doing extracurriculars, being social, and spending time with family. It would greatly impact those with mental illnesses, as it would allow them to work when they are in a healthy mental state, and allow them to work at anytime. This would result in a higher level of knowledge, a more stable mental health, and better grades 
While being at school you do not just learn about how to solve for 'x' in mathematics or who won the Mexican-American War, students subconsciously grow and learn more about their community throughout grade school. There is this whole other community aspect of learning going on that most do not even notice. 
Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea. And remember it only takes a few people to make a difference! 
Venus is the second planet in line to the sun. Earth's twin is Venus, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and the size. Earth, Venus and Mars are neighboring planets they all orbit the sun at different speeds. No man has been on Venus NASA has tried to send spaceships up to Venus but the ships never survived the landing some did but they didn't make it past a few hours. Venus has never been touched by man. 
I disagree with the principals actions 
but summer projects are once again just about assuring that students are learning and usually not followed up on as true assignments. The question of if a student learned the same thing as everyone else should not be as important as them just learning something relevant in general. 
That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars. We should stay with what we have until we are 100% sure about things. 
They will not constantly have to talk to teachers or other classmates about work, or have to work on a project in a group, which can help them tremendously with people skills. They generally will not make friends or see any of their friends because of them being at home while their friends are at school, which can cause anti-socialism. They will not be in class interacting with other teachers and students, which can lead to them not having confidence in talking or not wanting to talk to other people or students. 
which would reduce the complication process to produces a clear winner". 
There are dangers to Venus but there are also some good qualities to it that could help us in the near future. 
Lets face it many students do not or would not opt to participate in community service, its just unavoidable 
A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happend in 2000. 
I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit. 
The college is widely regarded as an anachronism. The Electoral college despite its lack of Democratic Pedigree. 
But so far, Google cars aren't truely driverless." The idea of a driverless car may put a person to ease, to where they aren't paying attention to the road ahead. The at ease person may become stressed when the car signals to take over. They might not even be ready to take over the wheel. This is a risky thing when coming to complicated traffic issues. 
When you narrow ideas down,you'll be more certain. All of the ideas will be narrowed down into one single idea which would be your final choice. When you ask your friends for advice,they'll help you. With their help,you might just know what your choice is going to be. Some of your friends might have been through the same thing or know what you're talking about. With their knowledge you might find your choice easier and faster and be more certain because they've been through the same thing. Asking your friends for help will help you out a lot because they might have been through the same thing so they know whats up 
In this short story the authoer is sayiing thet it is not woth you time to study venus. it not with the time but it is a star that shines bright inthe sky at nigh time 
I wouldn't let the students have the phones all day because that would effect their learning skills 
You should always seek another persons point of view or even advice because sometimes they may have a very valid point or a reasonable opinion. 
Some may argue that student designed projects will benifit the student more than a teacher designed project because of the chance of an easy grade. 
You should participate in the Seagoing cowboys 
but the students that don't want to do it that's up to the not you may be the principle but you can't make people do things they don't want to do you don't have that power. 
so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important! 
they need about 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes for our president. The electors equals the number of memebers in congressional delegation. Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pureposes of the elctoral college. any of our candidates run for our president. It runs how they act and how they are with the people that they have. The presidential election are every four years. The winner takes all and be's the new president. Our governer talk to us like a big long speech. They do a recoding of the new president. The electoral college, they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after every thing. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. This year voters can expect another close election.  Voters vote not just for there president, but for a slate of electors. The people would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors. The american people are lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest ellection. The voting takes place in the House of Representative and that are we vote for the president. 
For example,"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy." This evaluation of emotion is from the painting of Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. Even though it was just a picture or a painting, this technology identified all sorts of emotion. 
If someone wanted obama buit we got ramny when evryone voted for obama then people are going to be very mad becuse its wrong that we didnt get the presendnt that we wanted. riets could stgart and armys could form just because its not fair how the president is choosen. 
Peoples emotions can be kept to themselves and shouldn't be told to someone with a device instead they could just ask. 
Throughout reading this article I thought it provided very good and extensive research. Although I did see some major issues with the leading point of the passage. This author provided very good research but the research and evidence throughout the entire article controdicted their main message. 
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus" mainly supports how Venus is worth the riskand challenge to explore to see if it's as much like Earth as it's said to be, 
Some may argue that assignments should be student-designed because it allows the student to express themselves creatively through their work. By displaying their creativity and thought process, it makes the idea of having work over the summer more enjoyable. 
I hope my reasoning will persuade or atleast give you second thought on changing the school policy. I am one of many students who believe it is wrong to change the school policy . 
In the artcle the author says, "Hold on! Can we actually "calcuate" emotions - like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to espress how we feel?" (D'Alto 2). 
It's important that it has it so that it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. According to the article Does the Electoral College worksource three states,In the 2012 election,for example Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elcetoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney 
I'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great. Let those individuals choose what they would like to do. 
The use of cell phones and other handheld devices make daily life in the 21st century easier and more convenient than it has ever been 
very four years there is an election.  The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years.  The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections.  The articles "Does the Electoral College Work?" and "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use.  On the other hand, the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. 
Many times, people voting for a candidate get confused on who they are voting for, and often get confused. 
It would make much more scence instead of the whole Congress blah, blah, blah, and stuff. I mean I know that this was created by our Founding Fathers and should show respect, but popular voting won't take as long and much faster too 
Venus is a planet in our Solar System, Venus gets often referred as the Earth's "Twin" due to the density, size and occasionally the closets in distance too 
Kids need these phones to communicate with their parents while still on school grounds so they don't miss the bus or can't get home.Also, if children have free time it should be their choice what they do with it.During free block phones should be allowed because kids might not have any work to do, answer should be able to choose what they do during their "free" time. Projects that are done as a group would be easier to complete if cell phone use is permitted. If the kid wants to use their phone to communicate with a person in a different classroom they should be allowed to as long as it is not disruptive to other students.One way to avoid this is to require all phones to be set on vibrate so that the rings are not disruptive. 
Second, just like Earth Venus has mountains and valleys. 
So I think having the new technology in school can be really helpful and useful for everyone but most likely the teacher's. 
It wouldn't be fair for most of the students to not be able to participate. 
But if it works than the researchers can not take samples of rocks and gas or anything else. 
It makes no sense why you would believe that aliens would have make this landform. You should believe me I am the scientist at NASA. In conclusion just trust me, the scientist at NASA, and just believe that this landform is natural not made by aliens.   
like in the article it talks about how your muscles movements move, ''For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your're surprised; your obricularis oris (around your mouth) tightens up your lips to show anger.'' This shows that with these movements of characters it can show what kind of emotion a student is feeling in a classroom. 
I also think that middle school kids shouldn't be handling elementary children. We are not certified and do not have a license. Some of the students might also not know C.P.R.. Which eigth graders are learning C.P.R. and are learning the techniques to help anyone. Knowing C.P.R. can decide wether a child lives or dies. I mean everybody knows that kids in elementary school like to chew on toys and sometimes don't chew there food all the way and they start to choke. The middle school children if they don't know C.P.R. they will be scared and will not know what to do. That's why i feel a middle school child should not be handling a elementary child by themselves. The only way that they should be allowed to do so is that they have the child's parent or an adult they know to help watch the child so nothing goes wrong. 
Not only would the driverless car be safe, but it would also be efficient. 
its a very important process of how we choose the president. If we just put our say in the votes some people might feellike htey amde the wrong choose in the voting 
Because everybody has a way of learning some students adapt quick and others learn slowly,but taking this one on one course helps you adapt really quick because you are alone in a quite environment which is going to help you adapt really quick! 
even though it will be really hard to get anyhing back from there 
I dont think it is a good idea at all. 
policy 2 i don't under stand why u guys don't allow in on school grounds when you know people will still do it 
Sometimes you got to lie, so you could be left alone 
Teacher designed projects allow no room for creativity nor responsibility because there are guidelines and an examples set in place by the teacher,students have to follow. Thus, resulting in one hundred or more projects that all sound the same and lack any indication of the student's voice. 
I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school around free time and at lunch periods. 
According to experts, more than 3,000 teens die to texting while driving 
because with the electoral college not everyone is getting to vote like they should be doing. 
Another example is if you want to adopt a new pet but you don't know if you should adopt a hamster or a bird, so you decide to ask your friend, who has a bird, if you would be a good bird owner. Your friend could tell you that having a pet bird takes a lot of time and you need to be able to give your birds the proper care and attention that they need. Whereas when you asked your friend who has a hamster if they need a lot of attention she said no because they are nocturnal .You know that you're a very busy person so with the information your friends gave you, you can make an educated decision to not get the bird. 
This technology can help with keeping the kids concentrated and help them learn better 
they know what they will teacher in the following school year. 
There are many things us as students can do such as 
I agree with Policy 1. Text in free time, lunch, and at their lockers. A lot of people would love to text people during class. I don't think they should call in class because they could be texting answers to there friends who wasn't in that class yet. That's why there should be off when they are in class. After school would also work to like when they are walking to there bus or to there car. I agree with policy 1. 
Students should, 
Also most of us will probably know how someone is feeling but some of us will not and that is were the Facial Action Coding system kickes in. 
Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced. These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand. But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus. 
I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides 
It's good to have multiple opinions, 
Even though technology is a huge part of the world today to help with certain problem and can be really helpful to people. The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. 
Moreover, the author gives reasoning that "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannnot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective." Researchers could also not be able to take any samples of anything from Venus from a distance if NASA were to proceed with the blimp-like plan, 
I pretty sure most of the voters or the states don't know this but did you know when we the voters "vote for the presidental canidate" we're actually voting for a slate of electors? 
The electoral college is not a place, but a process. 
My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home. 
Natural landforms, created by aliens no one will actually really know what they think. I think it was naturally formed not created by aliens there really is no real evidence about it created by aliens. There could be thousand possibilites that it was form naturally or created by aliens. There are plenty reasons to believe that it was natural causes but not as much as it being created by aliens, after all who doesn't love a good mystery. 
The process of voting through the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers.  
If someone is looking for advice and they get multiple answers on what type of advice to take, they'll ask other people if it's good advice or not so they can narrow down if they want to take that advice or ask for better advice.Another way getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is if they are making a bad decision getting multiple good opinions on why that decision is bad could help them stop doing bad things and make them do good things. 
we students have to choose which activity we would like to do. Maybe you don't like any of the clubs or classes that are provided. Then they would have to choose a club that they do not enjoy, and would most likely not gain anything from their experience. Students will not gain any experience from the activities because it seems boring to them and they do not pay attention. I don't take any clubs because of the lack of time. There are some days however that I feel that I have no homework and I can do whatever I want to do. I try to join a club and there is nothing that interest me. I don't play any of the insanely popular sports, neither am I good at chess or other things. There is one club that I am interested in doing but they are only open on the days that I'm busy. I can join other clubs that my friends are in, but I will feel awkward because I don't know anything about certain topics. 
Teacher-designed summer projects can prepare students for the coming year by addressing upcoming subbjects and topics students have previously struggled with. In addition, it prevents students from learning information wrong or doing the project incorrectly by giving them specific guidelines. These projects also ensures that students are challenged and learn new information. Teacher-designed summer projects would be more beneficial for students. 
because doesn't have the sufficient oxygen to survival. Thoughthe austronomers are fascined with Venus because is the most similar planet to the Earth. But this planet obviusly have a differents to Earth like, the surface on Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees that is crazy and impossible to survival and in venus are present Volcanos eruptions. 
Also students that know their topic are going to be more aware. Student-designed projects are coming from the students therefore, students are going to know all aspects and components 
Many states have a law saying that if too many days of school are canceled due to inclement weather, school days will unfortunately have to be added onto the end of the school year, so students can complete their education for that year. This can cause problems for many students as they might have a summer vacation already planned that'll have to be adjusted due to the extended school year. For instance, there was one year where my county had to add school days onto the end of the year due to additional snow days and that had messed up a lot of student's plans for the summer. Personally, I was able to adjust my vacation plans; however, I had many friends who ended up having to miss the last week of school due to this. If schools offered distance learning on these snow days, where students can still attend class online with their teachers, they can prevent additional school days at the end of the year due to weather. 
The Electoral Colloege has helped avioded run-off elections by reducing the complication of it all. 
On googles driverless car there radar system for one car cost two hundred million dollers. Who realisticly has two hundred million dollers to spend on a prius. With cost like that these cars are mor of a televison fantisy than a practicality. 
At ther most basic level the Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the Winner take All syaytem in each state, because of this durning the 2000 campain seventeen states did not see there canadates at all. The Electoral College is outdated and unfair. It is also irrational.  
In the first source its explain what a Electoral College is which is not a place it's a process the finding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a Congress vote and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the eledtors where they vote between a President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College has about 538 electors a majority of 270 are electoral votes is required to elect the President by which your state entitled allotment of electors equals the numer of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of the Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word "state" also refers to the District of the Columbia. 
"The EC is widely regarded as an Ananchronism"according to the article posted by Richard A Posner. Once again yet another reason to Abolish the EC 
First of all let me explain the passge, the passage talks about how we can use technology to identify human emotions. How is this technology valuable, well it's very valuable. 
I think we should in take concideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. 
students having inadequate knowledge of content, 
Nothing is the world is ever made perfect forever. The Electoral College was clearly a great idea when it was made or it would never be put into action. The Electoral College does have slight problems that rarely happen. The best thing about it though is that people could vote and change details about it if it was that big of a deal. 
Like i said if we just have a popular voting going around it doesn't make it fair for the Candidates running. We vote for the Slate of electors who then go an vote for President. I think this is right because some people don't understand political things and make the wrong choice of President. If we have people who are in the government and know how to be a good congress we should trust them to make the United States a well place to be. No one is ever going to have which ever Elector they want. Some people may just vote for one of the candidates because their bestfriend voted for him or her. 
Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college. 
In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face. 
Despite how many set backs people have had with trying to land rovers and other machines on Venus, people are still trying to find a way to gain further knowledge about the planet. With the temperature being set at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that could be enough alone for human do die. That would be like going into a fire. Even if they managed to build something to with stand higher heat, the atmosphere is made up of 97% carbon dioxide. The planet is practically burning causing carbon dioxide to blanket the whole planet. The atmosphere still stands at a 170 degree temperature. High enough temperature can metal some metals and most materials or burn them. 
Something else that is credible is that no life form has been found on Mars yet. 
From Luke's experieance he know's that he is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a "Seagoing Cowboy" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.Being aSeagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,"It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs." And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever! We are very lucky to live in the USA becuase we have many more oppertunities the anyone else does.      
because it causes people to die and get into car accidents. 
Ooh and if whoever is reading this or if your grading this be remind ed if this was getermining if I were to get out of entsive reading or not for next year i really wouyld try harder. Because we both know this isn't. And im cencerly sorry i havent prepared a better passage for you to read. But im pretty sure you don't read all of it. 
Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms. 
I know for a fact that once every student does community service that our community will be showing a great example for other students at other schools. 
First on every Monday no one can drive their cars do due to smog so they're trying to reduce the smoke in the air. Second on that same day people with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31$ fine. Thrid almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to reuters twenty-one people had their cars impounded for their reaction on the fine. Frouth Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.First in Bogota their is car free day spinning into a big hit. Second they pay for you're ride so that you don't drive you're car. Thrid so their turnout was large,despite gray clounds that dumed occasional rain showers on Bogota.    
So if there were thnings that were made but non natural then they would be able t o see all the falts andpices you can tell that were not naturally made 
would be unsuccessful due to teenagers lack of motivation. 
Throughout grade school we all had a hard time adjusting to diffrent teachers as well as their teaching methods. However, if every teacher were to create a summer project to match thier teaching methods, students would be able to adjust to diffrent teaching styles which, not only would benefit the student themselves but it would also their raise their grades dramatically. Studies have shown that a student will perform better with teachers who he/she feels comfotable with, boosting their grades and overall academic perfomance. 
You can tour big places while you are there. That is one of the big reasons I joined the program 
For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. 
Venus is too hot for us to explore. Landing a spacecraft would only last moments because of how severe the weather is on Venus 
However, despite the worries and concerns that some people may have, the Electoral College is still the best method for voting. 
In this article, the author is telling it's readers that traveling to Venus can be risky. 
As stated in source three, paragraph one ,"The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." The meaning in this is that people vote for the people who vote people. 
I think you should have the school adopt a road and help pick up trash that people have left behind. 
I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.  
Scientist figured it's a martian mesa 
Well, if they tried distance learning, those students wouldn't have the troubles of the system lingering over them, and they could just get the work done. Sure, one would say that it takes away valuable social time, but if one thinks about it, it could also leave some free time to hang out with friends. Having that option, they wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they're precisely following the rules, if they're causing too much of a ruckus, or simply about what others might think of them. 
saving paper is extremely important. 
At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. 
You can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming. This is why this is just a landmark. There is a lot of landmarks on earth and this is one of them on Mars. There is no evidence of any of this so don't believe what everybody says.              
My claim for this story is people are trying see how are people feeling in a picture and trying to hdie thir emotions 
Like, what if you could play a mean harmonica without even knowing it? You wouldn't have a clue unless you signed up for an extra activity. You might even be a good chess player. Im pretty good at chess and I wouldnt have known that unless I played a quick game with a friend. You could even make new friends with your newly discovered skills. Some activities can help you later in life, like if you need to knit a rope because you got lost in a forest, or you need to know how to jump start a car because it broke down on the side of the road, well no problem you already know how to do it because of the activity. 
For example barrack obama should not have won and wouldnt have won the second time if it werent for this scrub system of voting. 
sports help with physical strength 
one can reach the decision of a choice by a majority of one's peers. 
You also must know that the system has its faults 
Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. 
In conclusion, Science play an importent roll in technology and technology have created machines that can tell your emotions. We are humans and by the advance of technology, future then might change the way we act, think and possibly live our lives.               
Kids and young adults that go down wrong paths can change. After school or extracurricular can help that 
f you look at the first one, 1976, you can see the face clearly. In 1998, the face is starting to get a little blery. Now at 2001, you barely see the face, in fact there is not a face anyone.If this face was man-made or made by aliens, the shouldn't the face be more clearly in 1976. If man did make this face, how would they get there in the first place. 
They are common around the American West. 
Student-designed projects would show more creativeness, and is more helpful. Second, they can show how much one has learned. While teacher-designed projects are much more stressful, one will have to do it rule,by rule, by rule, one little mess up can lower your score by a whole grade. On teacher- designed projects the teacher also won't really tell who learned more, because they will all be very similar. Teacher-designed projects are also boring, because it's better when you can use your own ideas instead of someone else ideas. Teachers most of the time always give the people with the most perfectly organized project the best grade, when they dont even have good facts or anything about the project, while the people with not that good of organization but a lot of good information on the project get a lower grade. 
When it tells of how it could modify the lesson when it recognizes a student becoming bored sounds reasonable, when you think about it, having a computer changing a lesson simply due to possibly a single student becoming bored with it, would not only make the lesson longer, but maybe even worse off than it might've been. 
Scientist have thier studies. My question is how did this alien form this pop up form. If u say it was a alien does it live under the dust. I don't think so,because it adventually is going to die. This is nonsense to belive that aliens walked on Mars and formed a type of shape. It is just a natural form. 
Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable 
Luke wants other people to join the seagoing cowboy program. He wants people to join it so that persons life would change 
A student designed project would allow the student to be more creative with their learning process and with the finished product in general 
Hi, I am My'Ajah i am a scientists at NASA i am here to talk to you about the false claim about a face being on mars. At first i myself thought there was a face on mars me and my team thought it was very cool. And the attention we (NASA) got was tremendous, but we still had to look into it because if the world found out it really was not a face they could call us a fraud and we could lose much money. 
not only the enviroment 
"The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a  majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. That's enough electors to vote wether or not the president should be this person or that person 
if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.          
I would say it is time for a change and let the American people's voice be heard. 
The facial action coding can be used in good ways and in bad ways 
The electoral college is definatly something to argue about but in my opinion it should be kept. The Electoral college may seem a bit unfair but its also the most easiest desion making tool when it comes to electing. Its been around for years it would make no sense to get rid of it.    
In conclision NASA releases the picture to the press in 1976. Therists say thats NASA is trying to cover up their findings of this civilization. NASA finds out about what people are saying about a cover up .18 years later they are going back to Mars to take another photo with abetter camra 
Then they would end up not going to work and jobs wouldn't be getting done. If jobs didn't get done then we wouldn't have any new technology and we would slowly die out of the human race. No one wants that to happen do they? 
Most of the people who dont like this system of voting will most likely say that we the people dont really know any thing about who we are voting and that most of us who are voting for someone are just voting for them just because we have heard good thinds about them 
My Friend Generic_Name, had to do a project over summer during middle school. Her teacher allowed them to do it on their own and see what they can do. At first, she was startled because she didn't know what to do. She asked me for help but i couldn't cause i was struggling as well on what to do. We started planning one day, and remembering what we've learned over the past year. The thing she remembered most was in her history class, her teacher taught her something valuable and it was " You work hard enough, you can achieve anything in the world." That stuck with her for 5 years and she still remembered it. So for her project she did something based on that quote. She designed a poster where it shows the quote and little pictures of each class and showing what she liked about it. 
minimize the chance that students feel they are not being given a break. 
there are still physical distractions that schools cannot stop. 
For example, a person that is 15 might not have that good of advice for, let's say, parenting. Their advice is not valid because they have no experience. However, going to someone else, like a person in their thirties to forties, would have a much better advice that would help you in the situation, because they have had at least five to ten years of experience behind them. 
some people say the classes online, home , or video conference that not good 
yet it still resembled a face so conspiarators still beleived that there was still life on mars or that there was life on Mars. The people that weren't saticfied said that The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of 1998 which is a cloudy time on Mars 
In my opinion i think that they should use The Facial action coding system 
Cutting back on sports and raising the grade point average is causeing obesity in teens all across America 
With my AP English teacher this year, 11th grade, I had summer reading to do and an assignment she attached with it. This book ended up tying into other books we discussed in class and fit into the curriculum very well. This shows how it benefits the teachers a lot with workload, and even students, because the assignment actually means something and isn't just a bogus last minute project they could make up and waste their time. 
Because of this, students may have to seek out additional resources to fully understand the material that is being presented to them. 
I suggest you go with policy number 2 unless you want to hear complaints from angry parents, choose believe. 
So i ask you in the nicest way i can please let the kids play sports and get involved in other actives with a C average. 
School already takes up a large chunk of the day, but by requiring students to do extracurricular activities, kids are forced to stay for one or two more hours doing activities that do not seem worth spending time on. If a student chooses to join an extracurricular because they wanted to and not because it was required, the activity wouldn't seem like a waste of time. For the other students, however, those few hours could be spent on homework, catching up on sleep, connecting with friends and family, or pursuing their interests outside of school. Many students are on sports travel teams, and they need the time to practice with their team. Some people take classes outside of school or just prefer to do activities they like at home. Although these students are not joining school clubs, they are still doing extracurricular activities and should be able to continue doing so without worrying about running out of time for homework or missing out on sleep. 
And if we didn't have community service then the community would be devastated. 
An explantion of the evidence is that Venus is to risky for astroughnaughts to study it. Really the only I say this that Venuses surface is the hottest out of all the planets. Venuses surface tempature averages 800 degress Fahrenheit. Alson the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to here on Earth.                       
Well that is what I think about seeking multiple opinion. I hope you know some benefit of seeking multiple opinion . Whould you like to seek multiple opinion from different people ? I also hope you learn smoething from what I think about seeking multiple opinion.                                 
can you imagine if instead of looking at those "4" electoral votes we had to look at each persons vote per state. Instead of knowing within a year or a couple months we'd know by the time the presidents term is up. Americans don't have the patience to wait all that time, "Time equals money." Electoral votes are much quicker and the certainty of the outcome of what you as a civilian want living in a certain state is very likely. 
I disagree.  
however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national populr vote. Yet that has happened in 2000, when gorge had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes 
Students should not be required to do community service because it's unfair for the students who don't want to clean or pick up trash 
A main factor in people buying cars is if they are safe. 
We took picture ten times more sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site,revealing a natural landform. 
If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count. 
While having the best intentions, public transit is often unreliable and falls short when needed. School buses can be later than they claim to be, resulting in students waiting outside in harsh weather, buses can come earlier than planned, leaving students deserted, there are times where substitute bus drivers, that aren't familiar with the streets, stray from the route, and even instances where students have to walk long distances to simply reach a bus stop 
Many scientist are trying to explore this planet despite its inhospital conditions because it is very identical to Earth. 
I would rather be around friends, than by myself. 
Although this is my oppinion many other's agree with what im am trying to argue. I also agree that these are natural land form's and are soon going to be wiped away. 
Here is my evidence to what I think about this situation. 
During the project they will learn stuff about the software. Later they will know what to do if it breaks or when they will creat a software. 
It shouldn't be a priority for students to help. It should be a decided thing whether the student wants to or not. Kids all want to have fun and most students don't want to spend their time doing community service. So why make them? Let kids have fun, let kids decide whether or not they want to do community service. Its the right thing to do. 
"Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original Vikings photos. 
 it leads to more discussion, 
After all those years I stopped, but I still remember the adventure. Most of all I remember it was a chance of a lifetime, all the trips we made, and all the fun we had. The trip was definintly worth it. 
The author asks us a very good question. He asked, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?" There will people suing the companies because they expected the driverless car to be a safe car and be able to drive itself because it's a driveless car. 
Lots of presidents have won by electoral college not by the voters. These presidents that are elected by the electoral college can possibly be the presidents to bring the United States to the ground. 
For most students, summer means the beginning of a much needed months-long break from school. For some, however, the stress of school never fades away. Some schools require that students complete assigned summer projects in order to continue learning, even when not in school. The importance of continued education is rarely argued, but the way some projects are planned out might not always result in engagement and time investment from the student. 
I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future. 
and it is also very helpful to the environment around you. 
it would be a good thing because people get to see the sea. 
These cars are very fesable 
This results in being able to see how others actually feel. Someone else might see something in a totally different way then you see it. They might show something that is completely obvious that you never saw. Better ideology and reasons might be received as well. Doing so opens up new possibilities for different ideas. Asking others for their opinion certainly gives multiple points of view. 
Belive it or not some of the electors dont even vote for the president they are representing 
All in all, the cutbacks on the usage of natural resources, the advanced technology used to increase the safety of the driver, and the many built in safety features advocate for the production of the driverless car.   
Finally, where the "face" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. 
While we are driving we spend so much time paying attention to the road, but what if didn't have to? We would have that time to do other things, like maybe work on a new great project that could change the world. With driverless cars, taxi drivers wouldn't have a job. That means that they would have to find something else to do. They could become doctors and bring us back to health; They could become officers and protect us from the dangers in the world. 
Generic_Name lives in a low income area of where he lives and his education is not going the best but with online schooling he could receive education from elsewhere. There are millions of students just like Generic_Name that just want a better education, and with online school this is possible. This isnt just low income areas many schools in higher income areas give poor educations too. Generic_Name lives in north Dakota and there are NO schools in his area but with online classes he could attend online school in a different state. Rather than living near a low quality school Generic_Name dose not live near any schools at all. With online schooling Generic_Name could get the education he needs to be a success in the modern world. In conclusion online schooling give learning opportunities to those who would not normally receive them. 
I strongly agree with Policy 1. I strongly disagree with Policy 2, kids would get mad more kids would test the school to see if they are serious and then find out the consequences but do it over and over again. 
Finally,the electorial college is unfair to voters 
After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument. 
Sports are based on levels of fitness, not brain activity. 
The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there. 
Students should have the projects be teacher-designed because if students designed the projects they would be easier than if the teachers designed them. 
The thing they should do is that all students have free time at the same time so that they do not try to cheat in class. 
one day I would love to use this meachine. its just so diffrenet from looking at your friend and seeing what you think their feeling that actually feeling what they are feeling. In this article they were testing da Vinci and they named a code for it. it is called "da Vinci code." 
Community service allows the community to become cleaner and better by students helping 
In the bottom of paragraph seven it says that " Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin 
For an example on the 2000 U.S. Presidental race, Al Gore recieved more of the individual votes than George W. Bush, but Bush only the won election because he recieved 271 electoral votes than Al Gore's 266! It wasn't fair that    
The required summer assignments should be teacher-designed by the students upcoming teacher 
it would allow teachers to know when students become confused 
the youth of tomorrow are taking it as serious as Gun control, College Debt and other pressing matters. Allowing us students to work and talk about problems all around us would be a pleasure to spread awareness on these subjects. 
Finally. Venus is a planet close to the sun, its even the hottest planet ever. Nobody wants to go to Venus because its hot and you can die by going into Venus and knowing that scientists don't want to go put a foot on the planet because they're scared they going to die or anything bad is going to happened. 
Not only is this dangerous, but the cost of the vehicle will increase because the product is new and "advanced". 
Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception. 
My conclusion to all this is drive safe because I don't want to look on the news and see anybody getting hurt because of you are on your phone. If you don't care do it to save the other people from driving and I see why they are pushing this to be outlaws so there could be less accident on the road. I hope and thank you for reading my essays.   
This can be compared to a well known classicMatilda, a movie about a little girl who has very high cognitive abilities, making her a child genius. She takes the public library as one of her primary resources for learning to read more books than any child of her age; however, Matilda was born into a family where intelligence and manners were not appreciated at all so she was shut down from her true mental capacities. If a child like her had these many resources, including an online system for lessons, she would've gone further with her learning in less time. She could have also done many courses herself to not be pushed aside by her family and made fun of for her desire to learn. 
Summer projects often receive mixed opinions among students and teachers alike. There is an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. 
The auther has good pionts he claims the average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees and that the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. 
Swing States. 
Finally students should be able to help our community out cause it will help them in school by bring their grades up or by getting an award from your principal. 
students will put in little to no effort in making the project meaningful. 
I Think Policy 1 Is Better Than Policy 2 Because phones Are Useful for Everyone. 
Then there are some that will. So we have to come together and make this happen 
When assigned a project during summer break, don't you wish you could have control? 
I understand why people may not want to do community service, because they have there own life to take care not pick up after other humans. 
A lot of people think that they don't want school but first you gotta think about your future what you want to be. 
Also , community service would be a good idea because it can also show kids how to treat the environment with respect , 
The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This new software has a promising applications for a variety of industries. "Can we actually calculate emotions, like math homework?" "How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?" 
And The elctoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism. Its hard for a democratic to win it. The Electors that elect for president not the people. This is another why this needs to be change. 
Some may argue that online classes have the ability to engage its students with insightful discussions with their teacher and peers online. 
From what I read, it is pretty high tech and they know what they are doing. If they ad these to classrooms to tell how boring or fun they are and how to make them better I think some kids would actually want to go to class. 
because Venus was once like the earth 
One reason I believe this would work because there is so much danger and anything can happen and we could use extra protection. 
Although many believe that these projects should be driven by the teacher, students should be the one to design these projects 
it's a distraction to anyone, no matter how skilled they are 
you worry less, 
So far The Electoral College has kept this country great with its voting way for President and Vice President. Changing The Electoral College will break its original way of the Constitutional compromise between the election of President and Congress. The original way is what made this country the way it is today. 
The shifts of car business in America have gotten car dealerships to worry about how many people are buying cars from dealerships due to the fact there's hybrid vehicles coming out which  lowers the use of gas and pollution on most vehicles such as the prius. There has been studies to show that young people that drive have decreased by Twenty three percent. Also another reason is that kids are able to carpool with friends or take local transport such as buses or taxis which limit the needs for a car.             
Venus is often reffered to as Earth's "twin" on paragraph two. It is also the closest planet to the Earth where 7.6 billion people are today. Each planet orbits the sun in different speeds and when the Earth fully orbits the sun, it is a brand new year! Every time NASA tries to explore Venus with a space prob or something familiar, it would never end up touching the ground of the planet due to a mailfunction with the gravity most of the time. 
I think you should consider the idea, and take in the fact that students have other important things to do 
Also at free times like in between classes and at lunch you can just go talk to your friend without using your phone because its not like you never see them unless they go to a different school 
To start with,the president of the United States should be elected by the popular vote of the people. 
Mars has plenty of landforms and its normal for landforms to creat a shape or face. 
First off I want to let you know that Electoral College is a process and not a place. It was established by the founding fathers. Process consists of the selection of the electors, the metings of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President. The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The amount of members in its congressional delegation, "one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two of your Senators". The candidate that's running for president in your state has it's own group of electors. They're generally chosen by the candidate's political party but that state law varys on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. 
it ensures it is, "Everyone's President" 
Not only does it keep the popularity vote out of check 
Only a few scientist thought it had something to do with aleins. 
Keeping their attention will attract them to finish. Many topics would not satisfy all variety of students so in order to keep all students interested and willing to do a summer project, letting summer projects be student-designed is a brilliant idea. 
Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers. Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead. Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year. Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break. 
. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. 
Also if you don't have phones at school and a parents tells the student that they will be here at three but they were late, then the student would be waiting outside for a long time until his/her mom or dad came to pick them up. 
How come everyone doesnt vote for who thy want by themselves ? Maybe someone whats a president frome another state instead of their own .According to paragraph fourteen , It states that the electoral college is unfair , outdated and irrational and i agree one hundred percent . As Bob Dole Says Abolish the Electoral College . 
Besides, the technology make us a lazy and affect on our body. For example,when we use our smart phone it so bad on our an eyes. 
Today we will talking about The challenge of Exploring Venus, what's is venus, where is ubicate venus and why is important talk or learn about this subject or who discovered this mean. 
I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future. You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks. You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do. You should be able to have your own choice. 
The landform on Mars is quite interesting, and there could be many thoughts on how it came to be. With already known knowledge and knowledge that is soon to come, people like to guess 
In my opinion popular vote is messy, controversial and just down right uncalled for there is a plan within the electoral college and i think that they should keep was has been working. yes we are evolving as a whole but somethings are left to be the same and not tamperd with 
In the passage the author states that Venus was the closest planet to earth. 
When teachers assign work to students, its not for their own benefit. While most people think that teachers enjoy giving work, they're the ones spending countless hours correcting and grading their students assignments. By the end of ones long hot summer, all of the long nights and amazing memories are not only something special to ones heart, it can also be a kiss from an enemy. The amount of work that was constantly being inserted into a students mind disappears and with the new year approaching, the time it takes for each student to remember all of the hundreds of hours worth of information can be spent learning new topics. Summer assignments designed by teachers are most effective for each individual student because it implements previous information learned by students, allows students to find required tools to complete assigned work without a teacher, and finally prepares one for future occupations that work a students mind constantly throughout the summer.  
To be honest I don't like playing sports because I am really bad at sports well some of them i am good but most bad. so you wont be seeing me playing any sports, only the sports i like to play . but you really should let the students who have at least a "c" average to in the sports you say that's aloud to play at the right tome of the year. 
According to, "The Indefensible College", by Bradford Plummer, Americans lose out on more than just an acountable vote. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they are certain of having no chance in winning. Logically, candidates only spend their time in the "swing states" where they could possibly steal al of that states eleectoral college votes (lines 13-20). Shockingly 17 states didn't see a single candidate during the 2000 election (lines 20-21). We sure did suceed and ignoring hundreds of thousands Americans there. 
In my oppion they should use the Electoral college to desied who wins the Election. 
because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students 
staying active 
by listening to just one person, you may only get that one person's opinion about what he or she believes is right. It is important to listen to what many others have to say in order to make the best decision for yourself. Recently, I got a bad grade on a math test. My grade hadn't gone below a 98% in Algebra so far. This test brought me down a whole letter grade. I didn't know if I should retake it or not. I knew it probably wouldn't bring my grade up much. However, I still didn't know what to do. I asked my Math teacher, my parents, and a few of my friends. Each looked at the situation differently. After listening to all of these perspectives, I put them together and formed my own decision. As long as I did my homework and got a good grade on the next test, I would be back up to an A and not have to retake it. I was helped a lot by getting different opinions of people with different backgrounds. 
So what is the electorial collage you might ask well what happends is voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas and voted for john kerry you vote for a state of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. on the off chance that thoes electors won the statewide electon they would get 34 electoral votes and kerry would get 34 electoral votes.                 
Attending after school clubs and activities can give you a place where people with similar interests and hobbies all come together. 
If a student is failing a class or classes and needs points to pass their class require them to do community service. 
The third and final reason the author wrote about in the passage was written in paragraph three as it stated, " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. 
Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . . Democrats in Texas, for example , or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect , tghey have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. . . .            
I Write to you about the Electional Colleges because, i beleive that it is fair to change it to which ever runner has the most votes will become president. 
Although some may ask, why dont you just ask us how we feel in this class 
Some people may think that the Face was created by aliens, but it was not. 
Summer break is meant to give kids a break from school and the constant teacher-chosen workload. 
I think that we should get rid of the eletoral collage and switch to a popular vote system 
The face on mars is just a lndform 
That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. 
When a parent give a child a cell phone they act different they don't know how to put the cell phone down students go out of hand with it they go play on people phone they bully other children. 
''The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery'' said Dr,Huang.Dr. Huang and his colleague experts are developing better ways for humans and computer to communicate. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscules. It haves Six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associasted each with characterisctic movments of the facial muscles. 
I agree with this because I like to be that guy that helps others with no cost. 
learn what to do. 
In total, the electoral college is an unfair way to choose our presidents. The method has a lot of bias and doesn't give a fair voice to all the states and its voters. The method has a lot of flaws and is a non-democratic way to elect our presidents.      
it can introduce students to something they've overlooked or have never heard of before 
You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities. 
In conclusion, if these "driverless" cars are allowed to continue to be tested and improved upon, countless lives will be saved and human efficiency will increase. As this fantastic technology is improved upon, the negative aspects of trial and error, restrictive laws, and cost will only decrease. As for the future, human culture as we know it will change to alot this new technological enhancement into our everday lives, and in the process, potentially save thousands of individuals with ever purchase of a new "smart" car. 
In the last paragraph it is said that "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." 
Community service is a great way of helping the community become better in a whole. 
"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight racs in the "swing" states." 
So that kinda makes people think that NASA is lying about the "Face" being a natural landmark. The Government and NASA are keeping secrets in Area 51. So they must be keeping this whole "Face" thing secret too. That it's not a butte or a mesa. But that it was created by life on Mars. 
"the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor" this sentence from the "Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" explains that it is very peaceful because theres no noise, 
In "THE CHALLENGE OF EXPLORING VENUS" the author of suggests that studys venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger it peresnts. 
better understandings of the situation 
Society is no longer in the era of the stereotypical paper and pencil. New advancements in technology offer a wide variety of options for a student's education. With internet, there are limitless opportunities as far as how and where a student needs to be in order to get a proper education. Home-schooling is a new trend that is gaining more popularity throughout the world each and every day. Other than the people that would be in a school, this system provides the students with all of the necessities that a student would have access to as if they were in a school. 
it is likely those people probably experienced the same things as you, 
In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author gives their support to the idea of exploring the planet Venus. 
I fell like the author is correct about these staements because Space and the other plants are not safe for humans to even step foot on. 
Some students won't be able to understand what they are supposed to do. based on not understanding what the project is about they will end up giving up and not doing the project. Students making their own designed project would mean it would cause them to have to think more. They would have to gather a lot of information to make sure their project is good and filled with details. 
I agree with him on alot of things that hes done that's why i support him, he tries to provide healthier weapons and materials that would be safe to use. When he intervented this it says that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to distribute the forceful interaction to our capability of the since of Venus 
a less stimulating environment, 
If you also ask one people and it gets to an adult, then you would have to explain your problem to them even if you didn't want to. Then word would get around that you snitched to a teacher and then thats how bulling starts 
Studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers 
n conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback. 
These cars are a waste of money. 
All of these are great ways to get involved. i think the idea of enforcing community service is a great idea. 
As long as it might take to gather, more opinions matter. Multiple opinions matter because it show the true opinion of the ones involved and affected. Bandwagons must be considered into data because some will choose the side most picked. Choosing the best choice is interrupted by bandwagons that should be acknowledged into a final choice. When collecting data, make sure to collect from only those involved and effected by the decision. Seeking multiple opinions is a key part of collecting rich data. 
The votes should be runned by the people and they should have a say if the person running to be President or Vice President should run at all. 
can cause serious problems such as rumors and gossip. 
In the passage it reads under the 23rd ammendment of the constitution the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral Ccllege. But if you ask me me I'll be saying and asking you or in other words the congress why do you guys have to go through all of this just to get to a president election  and have a president of the United States .It's just some things the world have gone though are totally dramatic and this is the very first thing a person's going to say "the world's a very corrupt place nowadays"but in my eyes i say that the world can become a better place if the people cooperate togather and stop trying to always slice eachother's throats about a stupid reasoning over a dumb presidential election that the house of representatives have put togather and now they want to act as if they had no par-take in the action going on. So I think the people on our own should be able to vote fo rour own president and not have congress put in there who they think is fit for the position of being president. I state this because the one who always look peaches and cream aint always sugar they say things in the campaigns to get us americans on either sides but when we vote for that one who said he going to stop this and that and then when he get in the chair of being president,they don't do nothing at all 
The point is most of the kids just don't commit or have time or family events, everyone is different you can't just expect every kid just to go.So no I dont agree with what the princlai said at all and it should be there for kids to choose it or not for them to force it on the kids. 
there won't be a hands on experience. 
I think you should at least have up too a D grade point average 
I beleive that students will benefit in many ways from more schools offering distance learning as an option to attand class from home. 
If their is a run off election the people might think the election was rigged or unfair. 
It's a great way to assume how it happened by comparing Mars to Earth, but it could also be irrelevent. 
The electoral college process is very fair since which ever candidate running gets the majority of 270 electoral votes. 
in clounsion ,this is the best choose for students because they would get more time to sleep and get more time to eat a healthly breakfast. At the same time it is gonna be better for kids to work in there own paces and to finish doing work late when yoy have all the time you can at home. Its gonna be better for school because they are gonna have less costs at school for the students . 
A reason Venus is a dangerous place is the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. 
The technology we need to survive on venus 
It would be pointless for adults and teenagers to get lisence. It would be pointless to have rules of the road. 
In "Does the Electoral College Work" Source 1: What is The Ellectoral College? written by the office of the federal register states that"by a popular vote of qualified citizens". This displays that we the peoplewho are suppose to be here in The U.S qualified and a citizen are allowed to vote four our people because those are our rights. So Mr. Senator please keep the ellectoral College by helping to keep it for the people of the U.S just like me 
Many students have a hard time grasping a topic. If students decide to ask a colleague before a teacher, they have the chance of getting incorrect information or no help at all. For example, many students in the AP Computer Science course have to figure out problems of which have many different solution. Students who don't want to give away their specific answer will try to help students figure out a secondary solution. Unfortunately, most students will not be able to figure out a second solution, because they don't have enough experience. Once the student asks the teacher for help, the teacher will be able to help the student find a solution because of their expertise. Therefore, teachers can offer a more valuable source of knowledge that will stick with the student. 
In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney." 
The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
To begin with, the Electoral vote has a job to do. For example,if someone wants to run for president and the electoral vote has no voice in the selection there is a probability that the person doesn't get a change to talk to the people. As stated on(Source 3)"..... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors." 
Like when Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority in Electoral college. 
I would pick policy 1 
The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. 
The first reason why students should not take online classes, is that it causes room for distractions. 
I think that people shouldn't have to do community service unless they get into legal trouble such as a fight, and they are charged with assault. Or if someone steals something and they are charged with stealing. 
We need as much students as possible.Helping people is one of my hobbies.We can also provide different interesting stuff that students can do during tutoring time.We can provide sports and other things that they want.We can make it as an after school program.We should also provide buses to people that are going to stay. 
Venus has conditions that are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth 
It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiosities and that holds the most relevance to them. During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. 
The candidates have no regional appeal using this process. 
And that is unfair, I think we should change it to popular vote. 
In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents 
Whether people know it or not, sometimes they give bad advise. 
The peope of American should let their voice be heard. Why should we rely on the electoral college to pick our prisendent? In fact if you're going to rely on the electoral college to pick our next president why let civilized American citizens vote? 
Venus is the closes planet to being Earth-like. 
I also feel that this will give all of the lazy kids an opportunity to not be lazy and get up from the couch and make a difference for there community, my community, our community. 
students work best when they can do their own project their way 
you can make the decision faster. 
In Conclusion, the Electoral College is a process of election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I strongly believe that state senator should change the election by popular vote for the prsident of United States because electoral college is unfair to voters and it can cause problems in your state. 
This is why NASA is working on a wat to approach and study venus, 
Lastly, I will talk about how they are cheaper. 
Last,Our Muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's feet around your eyes, in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorious. But, to an expert faces don't lie; the muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. 
i recomend that the electorial voting should not be changed. 
I think that driving is a lot of fun and if we take away peoples ability to drive then we will miss out on a lot of fun and skills that can help in everyday life. 
error, 
I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. 
On Earth we have rocks formed naturally, or fossils were made using the imprint of dead animals and plants, but still formed naturally over time. 
other people may have more experience with the topic, 
A extracurricular activity is useless for some of the students. 
In the article it talked about trying to travel on Venus. I would say to my best opinion one day we will have the technology to travel to Venus and stay their for my then a couple weeks and be able to learn more about Earth's sister planet. What i like a lot about this article it that it makes sure to talk about a lot of similarities it has to earth and as well as s lot of differences it has to earth as well. What I found the most crazy about this was that no robot or anything we sent toVenus could survive the harsh conditions for more then a few hours. 
The author supports his claims by providing pros and cons on "The Challenge of Exploring Venus." 
Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. 
A school is the central point of socialization, whether it is working together to complete an assignment, or just conversing during your lunch break. Many long lasting relationships are established within a school environment. Home-schooled students cannot relate to in-school students in this sense. Not only is it important to form friendships, but it is also important to get comfortable around large crowds of people. Talking to people is an inevitable fate in everyone's life, this might be giving a presentation at work or publicly speaking in college. While it is a burden to most, starting earlier in life will provide more confidence for when you need it later in life. 
Imagine yourself as a teacher and one of your students clearly skipped your class yesterday and is lying about where they were yesterday, and all you see is a smirk, well what if you could teel if they were lying by a device that could read their facial expression 
In the world like the one today, reliability and consistently are key. People today enjoy things that are useful and fun. The children of this generation especially want that. Before the children can age and make something with their lives, someone along the road has to teach them 
Maybe if you tried other ways of asking people to volunteer 
being more accessible to public transportation is 
Some people say the class for students in the home , online, or videoconference is benefic for students other people say this is the bad things for studednts because they no learn more expecific and they dont practice in the clasroom because in home some students not have apropiate thins for stade. 
I think that as long as someone does what he is supposed to do then it is okay that they don't have to do community service. 
Furthermore, another way in which keeping the Electoral College would be disastorous would be seen in the case of a state sending two states of electors. Bradford Plumer reminded those in favor of the Electoral College that this has happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, enormous downfall was avoided because Vice President Richard Nixon, presider over the Senate, validated his opponent's electors and did so "without establishing a precedent." However, America may not be so lucky the next time this may take place. Senators in each and every state must open their eyes and really see what is happening in their country. The U.S must change its elections to the popular vote system, where all of these impacts will be avoided. The Electoral College does nothing for its citizens, and states may send two states of electors to it, and for these reasons, America will face a very unhappy situation if we keep this system. 
many teachers prefer that their course be taken online at home anyway due to the course's content and structure because it can help the student perform better. 
because it would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman, 
The research on these cars is significant for people in the future. Many years ago we would have never known all the important things about technology that we know today. By researching and testing the technology of the driverless car, we have produced more efficient knowledge for the future. Driverless cars need sensors to operate similar to a human driving the car, which is important to creating cars 
They say the facial expressions for each emotion are universal because even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, the new emotion are facial movements for example the painted face from the Mona Lisa, we can identify a lot emotions as Vinci's masterpiece. Each expression is a neutral face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,sad,etc. 
When students see their teachers everyday or every other day, not only do they learn about the subject matter, but also about each other as people. When students have a good relationship with a teacher, they seek advice from their teachers, ask for teacher recommendations, and talk about their successes and shortcomings both within the subject area and outside of school. The impact of this type of relationship can often be felt long after graduation. In addition, it is also much easier for a student to discuss with or ask questions to someone they feel comfortable around. A teacher that is unknown or only seen through a video conference feels foreign and awkward, making communication and understanding difficult. Then there are relationships between students: close friend groups, couples, study groups, and lab partners, all important parts of high school. Students build relationships that foster discussion and learning, as well as support each other emotionally. Musical ensembles, honor societies, volunteer organizations, sports teams, and student government, among other extracurriculars, would not be possible without physically meeting. Activities like these build close connections by bringing together people who share similar interests and impart specific knowledge outside of the core classes. Overall, collaboration between students teaches vital communication, teamwork, and leadership skills that are necessary regardless of profession and can only be gained through shared experience. 
I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. 
A human would swerve out of the way, speed up, or slow down. When something happens, the driverless cars "alert the driver," (Driverless Cars Are Coming) so that he or she may take control. In the short amount of time that it would take for the vehicle to alert the driver and for the driver to take control, disaster could be avoided, but due to this lack of reaction time, accidents could be unavoidable. Drivers must be alerted to any accidents that don't even include the car, forcing the driver to take control and navigate his or her self. 
Anyways if you really think about it we could make the world a better place, if we all stick together and help save the planet by doing the community services we are required 
There is also no completely proof that it is alien proof, and making a face on a planet would not be the best way to comunicate with humans. 
It just looks like a regular, normal landform, or it could of been from a meteroid that fell. If they think that aliens made those mount, they need to prove it with images of the rover going around Mars, 
summer projects should be teacher-designed. 
also to the health of people 
Another growing problem we have is laziness 
Some students learn better in an enviroment that's more quiet and a place where they feel safe such as their own home. Doing school from home is not for everyone, alot of students do homeschooling because they don't like school or if they dont feel as if they are safe and sometimes it's just too distracting for them so they make the decision to do school from home. Everyone learns differenty, it just matters how you apply yourself in your schoolwork and how you work. Many students struggle in school because they are worried about their grades and there is a lot of distractions that keep them from doing work sometimes. 
Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home 
there are many different advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution, many different acts of transportation, and because of Car Culture. 
but that's their call the VOTERS call, if they don't want to participate in the voting it's partially their fault the candidate they favor doesn't get selected. 
theres also some things thats wrong with the electoral college...1 : is that under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors, 
This system could be valuable but some people may see it different. 
Over the summer, many schools assign projects in order for students to continue working and learning year round. However, It is an incredibly heated debate as to whether teachers or students should design these assignments. 
Although some may believe otherwise, students benefit substantially when they attend classes from their homes 
If a student is unsure if their parents can pick them up from school or not when they aren't taking the bus, it is necessary to contact either their mom or dad to see if they can get home quickly after school ends. 
There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. 
it would stop social issues at school 
like when vice president richard nixon.  who was presiding over the seanate validated only his opponents elelcectors thats not right or fair he made sure to do so with out establishing a precedent what if it happens again the nations doseant need that . 
I think that if your going to make Congress's choices , able to rule over the peoples , then there shouldn't be two sides of the voting. 
driverless cars promote less disciplined actions with not only adults but with teen drivers. 
Continuing on, bullying has been a serious issue in today's society. It has come to a point where students feel unprotected in a place where their parents and teachers may think they feel safe. School is portrayed as a safe environment and should be. Although, in some situations it is not and many students have dealt with bullying in a learning environment. Bullying makes it difficult for any student to come to school focused and feel comfortable with who they are. Adding on to this reason, school shootings are another very important problem for why it is safer for students to attend online school at home. This dangerous act shatters the idea of any school being safe knowing someone could get hurt or worse. Attending online school helps avoid these kinds of situations. 
At first the scientists thought the face on mars was just another Martian mesa. 
However, in extremely serious situations distance learning is able to be beneficiary for students. 
You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related. 
The first thing is that everybody should be able to vote the second time not just ten people from each state. If those five outta ten people choose the same then that state wont count and thats not fair at all. Some of the people outta the ten that were chosen either didn't vote the first time or they have no idea what they are doing what so ever and they could possibly mess up the system or they could mess up the votes. 
By continuing to extracurricular activities, schools will positively benefit students by providing balance in their schedules, building new friendships, and giving them the opportunity to try new things. 
Its not like they have their ring tone blaring or anything. Teachers all know that we remember to put them on silent. 
The last reason the author supports this idea is in paragraph three when he states, "Even more challenging are the clouds of the highly corrrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere." 
There is no prof that and alien could have done that. If they think that they need to have prof that they are right. I might not have evidence that an alien could or couldn't have done that 
The Electoral College should stay our way of voting because with it we avoid run-off elections 
first its to distracting and the student wont be learning anything because he/she would be occupied doing something there not supposed to be doing. 
:it doesNOTallow for a simple method of voting, 
Both sides have good benefits, but traditional classes overtake online classes by a big long shot. 
I think that it would be expensive. Would there be only certin road we could us these types of cars on? The whole idea on have these types of cars amazes me but it would be kinda scary to try something like this out. 
Its spooky how looking at Mona Lisa picture can express yoiur emotions 
If it must be described as "emissions ... are choking cities" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with pre-existing respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task-oriented location that many go to with the aid of a car. 
voters in presidential rather than people who want express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
I know the Electoral College was established by our fouding fathers, but it is time to tart with something new and for something new to be established. I would honestly choose the popular vote because it also puts a suspence on people about who will win. The Electoral College may be widely regrded as an anachronism but when we vote we do not vote for a presidential candidate we're actually voting for slate electors. The college does not have a democratic pedigree which is another reason why we should use popular vote. 
Now as a quote this from source one this is one reson why we the people should be the ones who decide,"the electoral collage process consist of the selection of the electors."but now if you see in the end it can be proven that we are not the ones who get to pick its the electoral collage who gets to pick for us. but now if you look at anoher quote from source two it also shows more evidence that we don,t vote for the president but we simply vote for people who we think would represent us the best but 
It could let people have a different aspect on the community 
I do support this but ; however, there is some things about this that do concern me as a student. Some students could be angered by the use of this new technology and want their old lesson plans back 
I don't think u want to be leading a school of failing students. These students can do this on their own time 
The electoral college system is better than the popular vote system because every citizen should have a say in who is running the country they are living in. Also, if not everyone has a say in who their president is there would probably be claims of discrimination towards the government for not letting those people vote. There would,as well, not be a standard that could be set that everyone agrees on because the people excluded would not accept it. 
But I can certainly disagree and state that not only is transpotation through cars a great way to get around, but it's also entertaining. 
People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and the human race is known for making dreams into realality. For a long time driverless cars have only been seen in television shows and movies, but now big name companies are working hard to solve the probelms that face smart cars to make it come true. This dream is nothing new, and was first tested in 1950s by GM. 
I think you should let the students who have a C average play because when they have something to keep them entertain they will bring their grades up because they would want to stay in the sport they in. 
Gravin states that it reminds her\him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. 
The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that (under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.) 
but you can always change it if it gets out of hand. 
However, Students may still refrain from doing their projects. This is always true schools will always have some students who will not do their work especially summer projects. 
Some states have a winner takes all system, and what that system does is awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. But Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. after the prsidential election, our governor prepares a certificate of asertainment, l isting all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. 
the taxi service that drives you where you need to go, 
Even though there are some down sides to using Facial Action Coding System 
Just leave your phone at home and you can get it when you are going home. I understand if you are in sports and you have to stay after school or you have no ride home that day. 
I strongly believe students should make these summer assignments, allowing us to critically thing and be creative. Teachers want to make you critically think but their assignments are boring and always the same. We need students to put a fun and interesting spin on summer assignments. Leaving us with a brain full of knowledge and power. 
These things could make the student more willing to learn and be more excited about school. 
Driverless cars are a great idea but the dangers and other factors have not been depated yet. 
Some people might want to help out, but they don't have time. 
If it was human, in a couple of months or years (maybe), your body becomes rotton and turn into nun but bones. If it was human, then it would have body parts along side with it. There's no body parts near it except rocks and holes. Besides, the picture look like it was taking from a pretty far distance for the head is bigger then that boulder next to it. 
Personally, I believe that for some students, learning from home may be a much more beneficial method of schooling 
In conclusion, the facial action of recognition is some how bad, because students can act different if they know that there is a digital system recording them all the time, and can be good for them to pay more attention in class. 
In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to. 
Now you're probably thinking since our twin planet is so inhospitable, then why are sicentist even discussing futher vists to its surface? The reason behind is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus 
Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. 
That should be something you supposed to do on your own. 
becuase my first reason is becuase emotions matter alot. 
There is actually a myriad of benefits for students that results from them attending classes from home, 
maybe they have a job, friends, family, personal things they are dealing with or have to do, and making that change will push them over the edge and stop them from playing. Also a C is a passing grade so the students are passing their classes and keeping up with school and everything else while playing a sport they love, so there isn't really any need to change the grade average. It is just unfair to the students. It is just too much for the kids to handle. it will hurt them not help them. 
In paragraph three the text illustrates,"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat. 
The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. 
but not as much as the electoral college does. 
Third is you will have extra help than home or online. 
All they do is tally up the popular vote, and say "OK, im going to vote for Romney since that's what my people want."  Why can't we just vote for who we want instead of wasting our time! The popular vote should be the only way to vote. There shouldn't be a long and hard process to voting. If I go and vote, I don't want to have to know like 60 different people to vote for, I just want to check the box saying that I want to vote for 'so and so' and leave and go home. It is ridiculous about having a whole process to voting. 
Animals like , mammals , and reptiles can do things human beings cannot and will never be able to do . Reptiles may be able to poision its prey but Humans can't . Mammals can eat a human alive Humans cant do that ! Each group can do something the other one can't . One thing they all have in common is that they breathe air ! If aliens existed they wound not be able to survive unless they had a ' suit ' on the 24/7 . 
Do you think that the Unmasing face on Mars was created by akiens? Well my friens joe that i work with believes that the face on mars was. Joe and I are sciemtist for NASA, and we are here to discus the Unmasking face on Mars. So my friend Joe believes that the face on Mars was created by aliens. So here are some reasons why he believes hat he does on this theory. Joe said that "Scientist figured it was jst another Martin Messa, comnmon enough aroung Cydnoia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyption Pjaraoh. 
They also could be talking to someone very important. Like a cousin from another state or someone from a different school. 
Though machines have already taken away menial jobs, such as factory work, teaching is a career which requires a four year college degree and a license. Countless people aspire to become teachers, are we ready to take that away? Even if teachers were to work hand in hand with this technology there would still be flaws. Having a computer read the emotions of a student rather than a teacher would sever immportant student teacher ties, and cheat that student of the oppurtunity of a mentor relasionship. Because people are already capable of reading emotions, it would be foolish to replace that for a less precise piece of equipment. Because of the immportant role of teachers in the lives of students, the push for emotion detecting software in the classroom should be stopped. 
Throughout our nations history the majority vote has lost due to being outvoted when it comes to Electoral Colleges. Because of the majoity vote losing out to Electoral Colleges, people have come to believe their vote will not matter in the long run 
In that same paragraph it said that the same technology can make a computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery alos it said that most humans communtication is nonververbal including emotional communication. 
How many times a day do we talk on a phone or cell phone? Cell Phones have become a part of everyday life in the USA, so why does that need to change at school? 
so that the their teachers can make sure they include work from last year so they don't forget about the stuff they previously learned about, 
One of the main weather conditions that causes schools to cancel is heavy snow where ice would form on sidewalks and roads which creates hazardous conditions for students who walk to school and for school buses to drive on. The solution for weather cancellation issues is distance learning because students would benefit from having easy access to a mentor who would continue to educate them through the Internet while they are safely at home 
The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. 
One quick peek at your phone and suddenly there's a semi truck coming at you 100 miles per hour. It can happen in almost an instant. And the numbers are there to back it up! There is no way more than 25% of the people killed per year expected or saw the crash coming. 
Techonoly today becomes very important, and useful for all of the peoples in the world. 
Some simplified electronics made of silicone carbide, have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick. but it can be extremly delicate when it comes to physical conditions 
In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, "What Is The Electoral College," there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the canidates and the citizens who are voting 
Multiple opinions change surveys drastically. You may have received a data project at school or a survey for a new town project. These studies are most effective when more opinions are collected from. In order to make major decisions, you must first ask the people involved 
It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is "bona fide", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face. 
if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. 
and that there is no neeed to vote if their votes no longer count. 
as the author mentioned in Paragraph 3, Venus can be deadly due to the pressure and heat it holds. 
If you just get one opinion on something then you are only have one thing to go off of but if you have multiple than you can choose which one you think is best. This means a lot because the first opinion might not always be the best one for you. So go and get that second,third or maybe fourth opinion it won't hurt it will only help and you have many different people with different experiences in there life to help you. For example you could ask someone who dose not have much experience in what your asking but then if you get a second opinion they could help you because maybe they have had experience with it sometime in there life. So if you would have just got the one opinion it might not have turned out good as it would if you got that second opinion. So just getting one opinion may not be the best choice. 
As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service. 
The Seagoing Cowboys program is fantastic because you get to do a lot of things. This is a once and a lifetime opportunity. 
they're trying to bane car so that are eviroment get's better 
also less thinking into the drawings or other types of things that could involve using this technology. 
hey guys this is tyler, i'm a reporter, 
People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars." The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh 
I would say that if you do happened to see ANY student texting in class or on their phone period then you would probably have to take it. 
Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council.Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights. 
An increasingly common assumption is that pscyhological intuition, and creativity in some aspects, increases with age, thus students are less capable of designing a project, or most things for that matter, than adults. Several people argue that students may lack maturity, 
I think we should use them because since its free time its not gone to hurt any body to. 
Scientists believed the face was an alien artifact . It actually was not. 
The ability for children and teens to have online classes would be very beneficial because allows students to be at home, letting them have more time to act on their other interests. 
When creating these projects, students will be encouraged to work together. This will allow students to relate to each other, creating different ideas. 
When I was a Seagoing Cowboy,(Yes, I was!) along with helping other countries get back on their feet, I got to see awe-inspiring things 
Some of the people yet can't  vote but they watch the interviews the campains you make. What you are preparing for us for the future for our childrens parents and animals. For every single thing and we judge you the way we think is supposed to be we want our country to be better to be the best . We dont want some people we dont even know how they think to select something for us 
To me I still dont think thats enough evidence and detail to say I would stay home. 
To began, Taking Online class at home is help to take students time. 
Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
i think that we should cape the electoral college process 
it explores different point of views, 
,there are lots of reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Just dont join because u were ask to. They give you lots of opportunity in life that you many never get in life. If you join is program im sure you wont be let down.       
The opinion of people is that is a good form of meeting a President and Vice President the reason for is good an electoral college is because having of discussion the work and  your can see from who vote. 
Another thing is to review the important stuation of student who are taking classes at school. Given point to this topic is to analyzing the main result from students who are taking classes at home and the ones are taking classes at school. 
I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing. 
This is a system that makes sure that we know what kind of president we are putting in the white house and what are things to make this state a better state to live in and to have a good job 
Also, you would be able to go out and where a mask which many schools don't let you do that. If you are home schooled chance are you wouldn't catch a deadly virus as easy as a public school student. 
The author support the idea by showing us how studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. 
The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, " even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements." If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art. 
In conclusion, I think cell phones should be allowed in school during free times.If someone is using it when they shouldn't then they can be punished but let's not leave anyone in the dark if they are having a problem.If we help each other out then the world will definitely be a better place. 
One of the many symptoms of depression is memory loss. Since my mother had suffered from the illness, it was genetically passed down to me. Even as a child it was clear to me that school was mainly about memorization. When teachers talked about how we had learned topics in prior years my brain scattered through the many memories in my head but was unable to remember anything. Extracurricular activities aren't about your ability to memorize, but your motivation to excel. 
to have a nice grade and to succsed in life is to do your work in the class room and to always be something in life and to be respectful to others and to do a project when it's do the next day for a person thats always doing a project that will make your teacher happy that you did it over the break. 
I believe that the use of techonology to read student emotional expression is valuable. 
Assigning the projects to students can show the teacher many things. 
it is unfair for our American people 
Majority of current online classing has a system that allows teachers to record or stream lectures that explain the material. Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory. With this, students can make sure that they received and understood all of the content that they need to know for the classes that they are taking. 
If we helped out the people, it wouldn't only be a nice thing to do, but you could get some benefits as well. 
In paragraph 8 the questions, "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?" and, "Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?", were asked. In the same paragraph the author answers the question by saying, "We have to interpret the driving fun in new way." Manufacturers hope to fix that problem by introducing "in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."(Paragraph 8) These same ideas contradict the claim in paragraph 9 that says, "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acieved with alert drivers." How can drivers be alert if they are busy "having fun" before the car decides to hand over the controls to the driver. 
First up , by the people of the U.S.A. . What I mean by that is the poplare vote . With this system everyone's vote matter 
All country's have laws on texting and driving. 
The new emotion-reading technology could help in the classroom as it could make sure students stayed engaged in the lesson. 
Many cars are already having many problems so why make a car that can drive its self? 
Critics would argue that many students would get sick still. 
It's a good idea because it benefits the public 
You just cant count on some people that you dont know to choose for you. 
Reason are that because some student may not have time to do it student may plan out of town trips with family, 
Just because there is driverless cars coming soon doesn't mean that people can just drive them around whenever they feel like it, its same as being a car when you have control. You still have to watch out and go the speed limit, you can't take it and sleep when it's driving. 
NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. 
If we tutor little elementary kids that will help them improve their grades better in their classroom. 
Those are a few reason why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. Another reason is because it can cause stress by making the student focus on two things at once therefore bring the students grades down and make the student worried about if he or she will pass the year. Another reason is it can create a loss in productivity by slowing down the work rate of the student making them feel dumb or behind in class. The final reason to wrap it up is that it can overload a student by giving them too much work permanently putting themselves in a bad mental state at school just because of a little too much work. Those were all the reasons why you should not need a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. 
In addition, as far as being unfair goes, there are also unpredicatable scenerios that may occur in elections. These scenerios are far from fair to anybody. For instance, there is always the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that were to happen, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives where voting would be handed over to state delegations. 
First of all studying venus isn't a bad idea wanting to explore the deepest point of venus can change history and life, we can figure out many secrets that venus has and what kind of life form could be on venus because in every planet their's always something that hasn't been discovered. 
Kids would always try to text during class and on test if they were allowed to use there phone during lunchan 
If someone is injured and you have to help them while the car is moving thats another advantage. 
learning time management skills. 
First and foremost, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because this option is easier and much more convenient for students 
Some people like to talk to there friends about what happen over the phone last night and want to show them the text messages. Plus teenagers love to talk to people so when there friend is in another room they can text them what happened in there class. 
I do not think that online learning would be beneficial towards students 
I believe that the value of using technology to read students' emotional expression is important and it should be used. 
offer remedies to personal issues that stem from classroom learning 
As you see how other people are getting deeply hurt of what you are doing. Now am not asking you to abuse this opinion just to make people happy, but the main topic of what i am writing you is to think and observe around you. According to everyone else opinion, i am not only speaking for me now, but people are thinking to redo the election. People all country would like to vote for the same president of the U.S i know there are some states that have a president but like im saying, they want to change that. 
Presient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common; they won their presidencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote. (According to "In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Paragraph 22) Richard and Bill only won 43% of the popular vote against their opponents while they were running for office. 
In conclusion, the computer now encode different emotions if write down some simple instructions. This help us for can know if the Mona Lisa is smiling or had another emotion in her face. Not only with the Mona Lisa, can use that with anotner person. 
Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. 
Students get more free time to do online class at home. 
which some people get confused.  "...sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes..."  If people keep voting for the wrong candidate soon they will realize and the senator of Florida will be recieving more than one letter. 
the voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. 
the manufacturing could disfunction in the middle of driving. 
I believe that all students in school should take part in community service to help out their city, state, maybe even world. Students should at least have one day a week of community service 
plus i think it's a watse of time to try and collect every emotion of evryone who uses a computer 
There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, 
The technology is getting too advanced and people are starting to feel uncomfortable because they cant hide any secrets or any feelings that they have 
What if a police car or the ambulance is coming and the car doesn't pull over to the side of the road to let them have a clear passage to get where they need to go? Now you can possibly go to jail, but wait is that on you or the manufacturing company 
So i thing about what i told you you can know say that aliens did not create the face on mars. 
There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. 
With the elimination of a multitude of distractions found in public schools, students will find it easier to use the tools and technology given to them to aid their educational path. 
In conclusion,Thats why I think we need to get rid of the Electoral College and go to popular vote. Because of the meny people who want to get rid of the Electoral College I think its just a matter of time befor we dont have the Electoral College any more someday we will vote for the canadates we want insted of the Electoral College.       
all 44 major muscal in the model must move like a human muscles, six basic emotion happiness,surpris, anger disgust ,fear and sadness,even though indivduals often sshow varying degrees of expression like not smiliing as broadly.in real face or in the panted face of mona lisa. by weighting the different units the oftware can even identify mixed emotions, most of us would have troble actually decribing each facial trait the conveys happy,worried.the mona Lisa demonstration is relly intended to bring a smile to your face ,whike it just how this computer can do, putting on a happy face actually work,you can tell probably how a friend is feeling simply by the book on her face. the the mona lisa demonstration is really intendedvto bring a smile to her face, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomeing confused or bored. 
In my sophomore year I was assigned a summer assignment for world history. It was the same assignment given to the whole class, and was meant to be completed the same way as well. Completing it made it easier for my teacher and classmates to refer to as the year went on. Similar to a textbook, we all were able to use the same resource to make learning easier and allow the class to flow smoother. 
I know everybody has heard of a DUI , driving under the influence, charge. You get these if you are caught driving with a alcohol level over the state law , what happens if someone is completely drunk but the car is driving itsself? Does this give people the right to be intoxicated on the rodes because if somethig happens and the driver has to take control of the wheel they could kill somebody or theirselve. I feel like people would abuse these vehicals and do everything in them that they couldn't do in a normal car because at the end of the day they aren't driving. So this really goes back too the point that these vehicals aren't safe. 
I think NASAas our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms to go into space and explore many plants. 
For example" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence". The people that think taht it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says 
I'm not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I'm saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In 'Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog' by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it's polluted cities. Duffer shows us how "the smog" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding "smog." 
improve the emotional well being of students, 
because if you are Seagoing Cowboy you only have to work a couple hours a day. 
To get the students to help with the community then you should make community service more fun. 
When we know we could bring cell phones to school we could just bring them off and during our lunch period or free time we can turn them on and use them without fearing that the teacher is going to catch you using it when your not supposed to. 
I think the answer will be: yes, the computer they can read students' emotional. 
People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot people taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad. 
If we leave this problem as it is, every people will die because Earth is warming up year to year and we are on the crisis. 
The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this contery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president. 
The part about being in venus it is 97 percent carbin dixode its more. challenging then are clouds and it live closer to the sum the. the earths does. Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in the sloar system its hotter than mercury amd mercury is closer to the sum them venus is beyond hight temparture venus have powerful earthquakes it has alot of lighting streaks its seeking to the land. NASA wants to send people to venus to experiance venus. 
In the article it says that "The electoral college is a process, not a place and that the founding fathers were the ones to establish it in the constituion as a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress". 
I think that we should keep the Electoral College for five reasons. Number one,Certainty of Outcome 
Which is saying a lot now that we have'nt tried to change it just like we have changed everything else they had set in stone a long time ago. 
Venus is covered in almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the corrosive clouds that are sulfurc acid in Venus's atmosphere. The author decribes this by telling us that this is more extreme than anything humans have ever encountered. Since Venus has high pressure and temperature, it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author explains this by telling us the temperature and pressure of Venus's atmosphere. 
Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. 
The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in all the states, 
the kids would be working after school and they would be too tired when they got done working that they would go straight to sleep when they got home. they wouldn't be able to spend time at them on the weekend because the kids would want to have the time they could to play without having to go to work. Then the parents would be sad because they never have any time with their kids and the family would slowly fall apart. That's another reason why community service is bad. 
I think it will be a great program for computer to have. As long as you can turn them on and off at times. It would be a good way to get rid of adds.Dr. Huang thinks that Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint facial muscles precisly enough to coney specific emotions. The program would help the police with criminals becuse it would read there face and tell them what going on . 
Asking multiple people's opinions can also be a great stradegy for the work environment. 
then i feel lik that would seperte our world even moe ut this time is seperate from eachother from our closest friends and family because they would become our friends and they will become our family. i think if you want to end bulling and family problems etc. then is still not a good idea. like i said this still leads to segragation within ourseleves 
While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The general public has all reasons to be suspicious torwards the "Face of Mars!" Sounds like something from "The Twilight Zone. 
Summer is a time of relaxation, fun, and time to spend with family and friends. Summer can also be a time for a great off season for sports and a time to get better at your crafts. Many parents and teachers believe that the summer should be a time to really work on your mistakes or bad habits you've made over the school year. Whether its studying a subject, practicing a sport, or even working on your behavior. Over the summer some schools assign projects for students to do 
In conclution , i would like to make this argue because i think that we should be the ones that get the chance to vote for some one that i think we enough trust in please i hope that you understand the reason to why i am arguing in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by populor vote for the president of the united states 
This is why the policy of having phones ay school for emergencies, parent pick-ups, and the excitement for students. 
and the inability to distinguish home and work life. 
So if i pick my own decision it would be no changing policy and its good as it is 
It's like a disaster factor, and the system allows for much worst. and consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors. that those clectors could always defy the will of the people. 
Making decisions can be difficult when people don't have the confidence that their thinking is the best choice. This is why, when making important decisions, one tends to seek multiple opinions from others. 
reduce the number of car related injuries and deaths. 
Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts. 
Often after a teacher-designed project is finished, the only reaction of the student is relief that it's finally over. With teacher-designed projects, students often only work to completion, not to make a project they enjoy. However, if students are able to design their own projects, the reactions to their finished product would give them self-pride that they created what they believe to be their best work. For example, when I created a project after readingThe Road by Cormac McCarthy, I was able to look at my completed project with the feeling of pride and joy that I had truly created the best project I possibly could. 
expensive. 
They should have it as if you fail any of your classes you get more community service and then if you don't get the community service is results in bigger punishment. 
The school should treat students and teachers fairly. If there trying to be fair then the teachers shouldn't be aloud to use there cell phones during class either. 
and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it. 
This all changed his life, but for the better. 
I believe we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
As a student of your school i think that community service should be mandatory for all students. 
We can make this world a better place for the generations to come. 
Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels. 
for an example if you are doing community service and other kids laugh because its hours of work , well while your doing community service those kids can be getting into trouble for the stupidest reasons. 
Helping the community is a good thing, but people don't have to do it if they don't want to. 
Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve. Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project. 
This shows us that even the people that are fighting agaist the Electoral College are making random statements that either go for it or against it because they don't know what they are fighting to achieve. 
These things happen a lot, you can get a lot of diffrent shapes and sizes from natural landform this one on mars just happens to look like a really realistic face. 
Making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about. Some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting pal. 
Reuniting with the Seagoing Cowboys could be wonderful, you will have a great and adventurous trip. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you won't even realize that the time flies by because of the wonderful time you'll be having. I think everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it will be educational and you will help many people that need help and meet many people because, of the World War II and you will be able to experience outdoor natures that way you are not stuck inside the house playing video games or watching TVand instead help those that are in need. What places would you visit if you wnet to China? 
They are making technology to read the emotional expressions and that it knowns when your lieing. 
the elector college is widely know as a non-democratic way to vote for presidents 
What the author is getting to is that when we finally figure out how to get to Venus this could help us get to other planets as well. That is why I think that the author wants us to study Venus. 
Dear Florida senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been around for decades, produced by the founding fathers, it was made as a compromise between the two different ways the president should be elected. One way being by a slate of senators, and another by simply popular vote. It was made so that citizens could still have their vote, but more politically advanced senators could make a decision. 
Some think being able to have your car drive itself sounds nice. You could just sit in your car and listen to music while you wait to arive to your desination. Driverless cars would allow you to sit in your seat, hands on the wheel, but not acually driving. 
I also believe the school administration should create a presentation showing students that this can be indeed a very fun task! 
but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. 
in VAUBAN,Germany executives are making a big leap on forbidden street parking,driveways and home garages. it costs $40,000 to buy a parking space becuse of the retricans on cars. The reason for this "smart planning" is becuse 12 percent of green house gases in Europe come from tailpipes. David Goldberg qoutes that "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car and that will have to stop". In the United States the Environmental ProtectionAgency is promting car reduction becuse of pollution being at such a high polution rate. paris has the most smog out of any other European capital.BOGOTA,Colombia had a car free day and millions of colombians hiked,biked,skated or took buses. rain did not stop people from pertisipating in this event,for the first time two other colombian cities,cali and valledupar joined this event.president Obama ambitous goals were to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week. more americans are buying more and more less cars. Mr. sivaks son lives in san fransisco and has a car but takss bay area if nessecary. 
Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child. 
Community Service has always been a debated issue between students. Some find community service an enjoyable experience while others think that community service takes up too much of their free time. I agree with community service being an enjoyable experience. It is a relief to know you can make someone else's life easier and it's an exciting feeling to know that all the hard work you put forth will be appreciated. However, some students find community service boring and something will take up too much of their free time. I do have some suggestions of how we can fix this problem, 
The ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to Dr. Huang 
If they appreciate it more, they are also more likely to try harder on the project then they would have otherwise. They will also think it's a better idea if they formulated it rather than the teacher. People tend to love and appreciate their ideas more than other people's ideas. Even now, their are a lot of students who complain that they don't like the projects given to them. A lot of students blame the teacher if they got a bad grade on a test or a project but with this idea, they do not have someone to blame so they will be more pressured to do the project. Even though teachers have more knowledge and experience, students know what they themselves need to work on and improve with. Giving them control and a free opportunity to dive in deeper in areas they need more improvement in would make students be thankful towards the school. Some students may not take advantage of this but schools still need to keep faith that the majority would. The students who don't, probably also would not do it if it was teacher assigned it, but hearing "student made" is encouraging. Therefor, more students would get it done rather then if it was teacher made. 
Those emmissions are still rising. 
i wist we can help all the world for the little children can go to school they will me so happy ther dreem cambe real what day wish to du or gohave dome for demen that is all forme thank you.   
They have to get out the earth to come to another planet to just put your face on it out of no were. But if a person did put there face inprint on a another planet, I think they will turn into a alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tells that a FACE on a human body doing on a another planet they should be on earth. 
Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding. 
Along with having control over setting, students would be given control over how they use their time. Homeschooled students often have a lot of time to allocate for school and other activities. This is essential for every student to understand and master, as they will have the same choices when they grow into adults. Students who have other obligations outside of school will be allowed to modify their learning time each day, as well as take breaks from work as needed 
Summer projects are great for students and teachers alike, but should be teacher-designed because that way it is easier to follow a specific curriculum, it gets the students used to the teaching style of their new teacher, and it gives students more structure in general. All these reasons are very helpful for students and can not be achieved by student-designed projects. That is why all summer projects should be designed strictly by teachers. 
An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president. 
Electoral college is a huge part of history we've used electoral college for many many years 
We have gone on long enough with the electoral college, it is outdated and inefficient. 
Students miss school due to many factors; One of the main reasons why students miss schools is due to illnesses. Students who deal with very severe illnesses such as cancer are forced to not attend school for long periods of time. Which can hinder the student's future. Even illnesses that aren't very severe can still negatively affect students because most illnesses can be easily transmitted, such as the common cold, which can put other students' health at risk. To prevent this issue schools should offer distance learning by allowing the students to attend classes from anywhere whether it's their homes or hospitals. Students who suffer from health problems don't have to miss out on their education and get the same opportunity to learn like every healthy student. 
The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's "twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size." 
Using a phone while driving, be it calling, texting, or anything else, can lead to horrible and heartbreaking injuries and even deaths. 
I think that if you make the kids do it they wouldn't, you would have to punish them for not doing the community service so that would just make the students made at you. 
they also would provide many more opportunities for people all over the world 
it would be smart for the principle to implement that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others that have their same interests, students will get to meet other students that they wouldn't normally meet in normal school time, and the students will get an example on what it is like to work as a team and to prosper at doing your work.Starting with an extracurricular activity now will not only help you now, but it will help you later in life too.         
Kids who display anti-social tendencies or simply wish to stay home and away from the hustle-and-bustle of the outside world would prefer distance learning undoubtedly. 
Other opinions can help you choose because if multiple people give the same type of advice on what you should choose you should go with it. Although, you may think what if they're lying or what they say may not be accurate, the most important thing is to go with your gut feeling and if you do have the same opinion or idea as the person your talking with you should always go for it. At times when your not feeling the best connection with the advice you were given you should go with the other choice, there is never a requirement that you have to go with the advice your given when your not feeling it. 
Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? 
The teacher can focus on those targeted students spicificly, and not have to go over the same information multiply times. Knoledge is a great thing to have. 
Students know what they struggled with and what they were good at during the school year.Teachers can not always grasp what a student may need in order to keep improving. In order for students to recieve any sort of benefit from the summer project, is if they make it themselves.If I was able to make my own summer project with my classmate I would know what needed to be included in order for me to succeed. 
If you want a really excellent job, be a cowboy in the Seagoing Cowboy program. In fact, take it from me a cowboy who rides waves. 
It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!" 
The use of this technology in a classroom would be useful 
According to the NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk. Also texting while driving is now the lead cause of teen deaths in the USA, more than 3000 teens die each year alone as a result of sending a test message to somebody while they are in the use of a car. 
i think my school should make students do extracurricular activity at school 
How can a facial action coding system can identify a persons initial facial exspretion? Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases 
some reasons are they can lose their phone at school. its a rule at any school and any thing can happen. 
Also the congress does not know what the people want 
Like I said in the intro, If we had the materials to keep a human safe to walk on the planet and take samples. 
What have Richard NIxon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole, all in their time agreed on?The Electoral College.The Electoral College is not a place, its a process.By the passage of source 1 , the founding fathers established the Electoral College  as a compromise, between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
People who hear only one side of the story will have the same information but it is more likely to be bias since it is from only one side. For example I watched a movie the other day and it was about these kids who had to work together to get anything done, and if the didn't work together they got no work done. 
It 'll work the same I'm sure. We would have solar powered appliences so we wouldn't have to sorry about the everyday hassal of having to plug in, detangle, of trip over any more cords. This would be a major change for all of us drastic in fact, but still survivable. NASA has had some simpified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulated the Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such harsh and mild conditions 
Another reason is that the way people feel is how they feel, it's not meant for the whole world, the school, or anyone to know how they are feeling if they didn't tell that person 
Well to start off, i think kids should do community service is because all kids do when they get home from school is watch television and play video games 
The face on Mars has been proven to be a landform. They have taken pictures, the scientists have studied it, and all these studies have proved that the face is just land. In conclusion, sometimes things aren't as they seem 
Even though there is a great advantage there is also a great disatvantage to the system. 
electoral college should be kept because it will help save the tress by saving paper, 
People are becoming homeless, going days without eating, nearly starving, wearing the same clothes everyday and they cant do nothing about it because there are no jobs that they can take. People are being laid-off from their jobs which are leading to those events. If we have community service we will be able to make sure they don't go to bed with their bellies empty, we could make sure that they have a roof over their heads at night, and give them clean clothes to keep. This can really touch peoples hearts and if you were in the same position you would want somebody to do the same thing. 
The smallest states in the country can be not used like a thing or somethin like that because although the government says that we are in a samll state we have straights and that straights says that we can be free in the limits that we have. 
looking for advice is a good thing. one reason is that it will show you all the different point of views from people. Another reason is that it will show you new ideas. Finally it will show you the bad ideas. All these show that asking multiple people for advice is a good thing. 
Furthermore, The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats 
In this story that i just wrote, it tells you good reasons to take the chance of becoming a 'Seagoing Cowboy' .The fact that it would be so amazing and cool, and it once a again, a lifetime event. I would like you to think about what you would see and adventure while you are going adventuring to these amazing places, or maybe you don't want too, I would still like for you to think about that. So, for now on I want you to think about what i told you, and think about becoming one. 
you can experience adventures 
The electoral college should be abolished 
Yes, we have found flowing water but we have not found any type of living orgamisim. 
First, the author uses Venus's relationship to our own planet, Earth, to support their ideas. 
It's will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wife or daughter, Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better. 
I have been trying to make people under stand what it mean's to help. They don't want to help because they just want to litter throw can's not recycle or any thing to help 
I feel it should be up to the people of the united states not all up to the electors. 
it can be very hard to get lots of opinions and not be overly influenced and not listen to your own opinion. 
If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule. 
I think is good for you to seek opinion from people . Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you 
Starting off, there are plenty of students that are more relied on at home and taking online school would give them more time to assist at home. 
Those are the reasons that students shoulent have good grades 
Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, "may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. 
i think that we've impoved on the safety of everyone that is driving and that are still learning to drive and trying our hardest to keep people safe from harm but useally that doesn't happen, we would have some difficulties with the cars that we are using today still needs some work to be done with them 
its a good strategy to make your work more diverse 
There are many reasons you should 
In conclusion I think joining a extracurricular activity is a good idea for students because they could make new friends and find a new hobby they like. 
I am against this because I belive it would create many arguments and I belive we are not ready for this yet. 
It states, "The American people should consider themselves licky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thay those electors could always defy the will of people." 
they will get off of task very easily, 
On the other hand, driverless cars have multiple downsides, some aspects are clear improvements from automobiles today. 
Those are my reasons on why our school should do community service. 
You have to be responsible and be aware of your work 
The author supports this idea 
NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, "For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos," (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, "By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces," (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality. 
people should not waste there oney on something like that because by would peole need to know the emotions of students students are either happy neutral or sad 
If someone was texting and driving in their driverless car and they let their car take over and their driverless car failed to drive by itself and a accident occured who would be to blame? 
it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions 
I don't understand what's hard about driving a car just for a short amount of time. Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down. 
There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is? 
they are all basing it off of statistics 
I claim this technology 
most students play a sport or play instrument or find something to do after school hours. And if they don't they're probably busy studying or working on homework. Students dont just sit around and do nothing all night so i think this rule is pointless because a lot of students are already busy doing things. And if some students have to do more things on top of what they already do then that will only cause more stress and might make grades drop because they don't have as much time for school things. 
"NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted "huge rock formation... which rembles a human head. fprmed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars." (3)"The "Face on Mars" has since become a pop icon." (5) When I first saw it i had no idea what the face was, i thought maybe it was just me that saw it or something. I would have never guessed that it would become so big to us. 
NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus allow scientist to float above the fray. Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many researchers are working on innovations that allows our machines to last long enough to knowledge Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. 
For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities 
Many people now days don't have very high self esteem. 
You can learn how to make the better choice suitable for you when you talk to other people with more experience and wisdom than yourself. 
In conclusion, all the information the author of this passage provided me with gave me a better understanding on whether or not it's worth it to continue trying to discover more about this similar planet to Earth 
honing in on a students personal growth 
School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. 
However, there are several downsides to distance learning, particularly online school. In addition to the lack of information, there are crucial skills an individual gains from attending public or private school that they could never acquire through online school or video conferences. 
In fact, according to a study performed by Harvard University, almost 85 percent of students participate in after school activities that take up more than 8 hours of time per week. This would include practicing the activity and for many activities you would have to compete. For example, one of my friends, Generic_Name, does many activities. She plays on a competitive lacrosse team, she plays a musical instrument, and she takes all honor classes. She barely finishes all of her homework, and she has stupendous time management skills. If she had to take part in another after school activity, she wouldn't have time to do it all. Because kids do other things, if you made them partake in a new activity they would also become a lot more stressed. 
Although the electorla college system is for the voters to vote for a slate of electors to elect the president the citizens still get a say in the election towards there president of choice. 
Have you ever believed something that wasn't true? I have, but before you believe it you have to find out if it's true or not. In the article it says the "face" looks like it could have been a Martian mesa. Also the shadows and the lighting could be making it look more like a face. There for if the NASA wanted to go there to get evidence it would cost them a huge budget. 
Students should design the summer projects that they have to do. 
The Electoral College, can sometimes give voters no hope to the candidate they want to win because electors could vote for the other candidate. An example is, Republicans in a state might eventually know that their vote will have no effect so they end up paying less attention the the competing presidential candidates. I think that thats a reason how plurality happens and voters think its unfair.    
Online learning can be beneficial to students who have a different learning style. They tend to be more heavily technology based which can enhance learning of those who thrive on more technology incorporated lessons and assignments. 
these people dont know the good it will do thecountry. And the people who really need help. they dont want to help out other people. 
And venus it the hottest plant even though mercury closer to the sun 
The same technology can amke computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery because of of human is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Dr. Huang said computer should understand that too becuase its really hard and different. 
The students need some of their own freedom.We are already facing being a teenager and school.We need to be able to make a few more decisions in our everyday lives. 
Although many arguments cannot be proven until they are out and on the road in regularity, driverless cars should not be created for normal use. They can cause many problems on the road. They are unsafe and unentertaining to the occupants. They may have navigation issues when faced with and accident or a work zone or some form of traffic diversion. If driverless cars are produced, they may not stay popular for any long period of time. 
it is probably just a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or the Grand Canyon. 
Student should designed the summer project 
That time is given as a break from school since throughout all the other months, they are required to learn what they are being taught. If the project they are required to complete is student designed it wont seem like as much of a threat to them and wont be looked down upon as much. 
Finially, it is competative 
Ithink others should go join the seagoing cowboys program. 
Many people agree with the statment  that without cars their lives are easier and less stressful due to the fact that they no longer have to worry about traffic jams and car crashes as well as any other dangerous event that can happen while driving. This excerpt from the third source, shows a man's reply to the event Day Without Cars that takes place in Bogota,Colombia once a year. "'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza."(Source 3). This excerpt only furthers my point that less car usage causes people to be more calm and less worried or stressed. "'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter" (Source 1). This quote from source 1 which discusses a suburb in Germany that is car-free. This blurb shows another example of someone who became happier without a car. 
Reliance on cars has shaped modern society into a dependent state on oil. However, once that oil runs out, what type of lifestyle will people turn to? Limiting car usage provides this answer through a healthy lifestyle before this day arises. For example, In Bogota, Colombia, as Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times put it: "the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths" had been built within Bogota after years of limiting cars. People are shifting their reliance on cars and turning them into productive means of transportation. In fact, rush hour restrictions cut traffic and has led to a rise in parks and shopping districts in Bogota, according to Mr Selsky. Even Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman in Bogota enthusiastically exclaimed: "It's a good opportunity to take away stress..." as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. However, Bogota is not the only place where limiting car usage has been gaining support, the Mobile World Congress has been engaged too! Bill Ford, the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out his plan where he envisioned a "world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesriable," (Rosenthal). He believed that "partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety" (Rosenthal). If people around the globe are willing to support this movement, especially a chairman for one of the world's largest automotive companies, and partake in this new lifestyle, then limiting car usage must be the way to go. This new lifestyle of riding bikes, walking, and taking public transportation, will mold the traditional transportation mediums, into a more safe and secure one if citizens support this advantageous movement. 
I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the election of the president of the United States. Over sixty percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. I believe this change would make electing a president much more simple 
Paragraph 15 says "The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. 
But it is also good because students who have bad grades or cant focus in a classroom setting can take the oppertunity to use distance learning to pass there classes with ease. 
Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. 
Although the idea of not attending school and staying at home all day is a dream for many students, it fails to serve the same benefits to students that regular classrooms do. When comparing distance learning to classroom settings, it can be seen that learning in classrooms is a much more beneficial option. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be no face to face interactions with their instructors and peers, there would be no hands-on-learning within their class lessons, and students would not be able to become used to a college setting after participating in distance learning for a long time. 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable 
Principal, you should really think about this and give us a chance, because it might work. And if it don't, change the rule back to; no cell phones. I'm pretty sure the students wouldn't mess up!This is a good opportunity for the students, and maybe even for the teachers!But, you never know until' you try. 
will take it seriously, 
There all lots of things wrong with the Electoral College System in my opinon, like that when you vote for your President, your also choosing the electors that come along with him/her. 
make sure that you look at the schools benefit as a whole. 
Sure, The electoral college has some perks like a certainty of outcome 
You get to see animals and take care of them for a long while . 
Whether it's a sport, musical instrument, or anything else, events within that activity are often scheduled last minute or without the student knowing days ahead of time. When this happens, they may not have transportation to the location if it is not held at the same school. In this scenario, students should be able to contact a parent or friend who can drive them to wherever they need to be. 
Another positive thing about driverless cars is that keep improving for example in paragraph 7 the 2013 BMW announced a system called "Traffic Jam Assistants." 
Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos 
This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so. 
it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election 
The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. "The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress," states the article "What Is the Electoral College?" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. 
Due to this, it should not be allowed for individuals to use their phones 
FACS would be a smart tool for case workers or counslers 
Seeing the other side of things can really help choose what piece of advice to go through with. 
I find FACS a good thing a postive

Humans now live in a world where technology is accessed from all parts of the world. They are at a point where one does not need to be at the same place, or even country, to communicate. In some countries, a small number of businesses have even used technology to their advantage, and allow their workers to have the choice to work at home. However, when it comes to school, it is very different in the sense that students can be very limited when it comes to quality education and resources, which is important for a growing child. 
He gives facts and good reasons why people should study and visit venus 
I believe you will also be taking jobs of those who have went to college to major in this type of senarios 
I believe that we should not get rid of the Electoral College because it is a process thart some people like to take! This college had a lot of electors, 538, and to elect the president you have to have 270, and theres is more than enough electorals so why get rid of it? Each candidate running for president in your state has there on group of electors. 
summer is the only time off school, besides the weekends, where students actually get a break from everything. They no longer have to worry about grades or the big test coming up, its just days full of warmth and relaxation. Summer time is the time of year when no student should have to be doing any sort of school work at all. All students go to school for nine months out of the year, which leaves the three months to do absolutely nothing 
In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election 
I help the community out by cleaning up litter, donating my old clothes to the poor, also by donating canned food to the soup kitchen and by recycling. The people who don't want to do community service don't have to, they can just help out by donating canned foods or just recycling cans. 
As much as I think they need work now, I am not against the development of them as they could bring many potential benefits. 
Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice 
Also, when given multiple thoughts, the ability is there for the seeker to choose which one they prefer. 
They would not only get better jobs but they even can be paid more than what they would have if they wouldn't have gotten better grades. 
due to the extreamly dangerous potental the driverless car has. 
It's sad when you see all that garbage when you go somewhere beautiful on vacation. It makes me not want to go anymore after that 
An anachronism is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled and receives the most popular votes wins the president election. 
Teachers understand the format that works best with their students, something the students don't know enough about. Teachers can create a worksheet or document that is created to help students learn. Even younger teachers can create well composed projects because they had college classes to develop teaching skills. Older teachers have so much experience that they can craft an assignment with ease. I could not make an assignment for other students, because I lack the necessary experience to create expertly composed documents that teachers design to be efficient learning materials for the summer. 
I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, 
it prevents pollution and smog. 
During the school year, most students are very busy with school work, along with different activities such as jobs, sports, and school clubs. For the most students, summer is the only opportunity that they have to relax, or spend time with family and friends. Vacations and family events are usually panned to take place during the summer. And a school project could interfere with that precious time 
Have you ever seen something unusual in the ground? If so do you think it was created by humans or just a natural landform of some sort. Many people believe that most landforms on earth are made by humans 
Nothing good will ever come out of having one opinion, or even no opinion. If someone has a missing leg and has crutches, do not ask them about it, that could be a sensitive time in their lives and they may not feel comfortable talking to you about it. If they bring it up, then have at it, you just have to be vigilant and smart with these types of things. Try to avoid boundary crossing as much as possible. 
Remeber the disaster factor? 
The only con of doing this is we don't know who did it. You want think that really matter but it does because some can cheat for somebody. 
By removing unnecessarily strenuous factors such as the long hours and rigidity of traditional schooling, distance learning provides an avenue by which students of all backgrounds and situations are afforded the opportunity to thrive. 
On the other hand it would be way easier for people to vote. 
Find another way to help students and the community. There are a lot of things you can do to help. Just don't force people to do community work. Its just going to make things so much worse, 
Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though 
if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home. 
taking exercise won't only make you unhealthy it . Makes your mind unable to work to its fullest extent

you can take pictures also have all your friends in the yearbook and take pictures of them with you making memories with them. 
If there is already an apparent list of five reasons all about retaining the Electoral College because of its democratic pedigree, just is another reason as too why I'm against this kind of voting system. 
The main reason is it will help the commuinty 
Who really chooses the presidents ? That would be the electors who actually pick the president not the people. Mainly if you win the Electoral vote you still have to go through the popularity voting comes after that. Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate reciaves a mojority of the votes that are cast.    
Students are forced to learn in classrooms with another 20-30 students. Some students have trouble concentrating with so many of their peers present. There will be less people at a time in online classes, so they can learn better and acquire a better grasp on concepts, as there are less distracting factors. The primary benefit, however, is for students with social anxiety, those who feel intimidated by the presence of others, which is more common than one might think. Those who say social anxiety can be reduced by being around large quantities of people at a time do not understand the mechanisms of anxiety. Sometimes time is the best remedy; being forced to indulge in conversation with their peers will only be an obstacle to students with anxiety-related issues. This obstruction is eliminated in distance learning. 
some countries are making bans or just limiting the usage of cars. This can have more advantages than disadvantages. 
The election by popular vote is saying that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational 
because it's only counting Americans who represent the Democratic and the Republican. 
kids are passionate about there own activities 
"As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor" (Rosenthal paragraph 2). Heidrun Walter is the typical mother of two that has a job as a media trainer. Unlike most people, Heidrun lives in the city of Vauban, Germany. Vauban is a one of a kind district that cracks down on car use and promotes walking and public transportation. 
I think summer projects should be teacher designed 
Despite that, the machine can understand students that day. With a better understanding for the student, the lesson can be adjusted to make it more comprehensable 
There is a lot of danger in this planet 
. This Means That The Driverless Car Would Either Do Three Things If Confronted By A Accident . It Would Either Cause A Big Traffic Jam , Cause Another Accident , Or Even Cause Angry Citizens . Everyone Knows An Angry Citize Is Not A Nice Citizen. Then If There Is Already A Traffic Jam Due To The First Accident And A Driverless Care Cant Get Around It , That Would Cause A Huge Traffic Jam . 
Here's seven reasons to stop using your phone and driving it puts innocent lives at risk, it puts your life at risk, it is comparable to, if not worse than, driving under the influence ,you are more likely to crash, it's very easy to simply pull over, you are setting a bad example for children and it is often illegal. 
I know if you do intend to proceed in changing the policy we students will try to get better grades to play the sport 
The technology to read emotions would greatly change the way students learn. If a teacher used this technology and noticed that all of his students were bored and uninterested, he could alter the lesson plan to make it more fun 
Variouse forms of life, just like earth today, venus has some simliar stuff like earth it has valleys, moutains and craters and scientest think that venus was cover all in water like how earth was million years ago. Venus solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels,not easy condtions but survival for humans. 
The electoral college system is archane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely over-looked in an election. 
finding the best outcome, 
Driving is a human activity, it started with humans and should end the same way. 
Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. 
you would obviously need a phone or something for them to call for help 
It will help clean up our community and help bring the school close together. 
Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done. 
Sometimes they need help so you should get involved and help out every once in awhile. 
If it was teacher- designed, it wouldn't allow kids to express what they've been learning when the teacher is giving them instruction on what do. When kids show what they can do and put into a project, it shows that they've really payed attention and understood the lessons over the years. Also, the projects can allow students to reflect on what they learned and make something creative out of it. 
Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" believes. 
While the idea of driverless cars appeals to many, is it really practical for modern day America? Sergey Brin has proposed and imagined this utopian idea. 
Although many believe that students would benefit from attending classes from their homes, students would, in reality, be negatively affected by distance learning, 
So i think this is the process we should use to elect our people even if it is still an old way of doing things.  
the project will be less stressful for students 
In the end student designed projects are most beneficial to students due to their freedom to allow for critical thinking, the study of subjects students enjoy increasing learning motivations, and their unique ability to be tailored to each students needs.  
some of them live far away 
I agree in Mr. Plumber saying. Bradford Plumber said in his writing of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wong, "In the vein, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for there party's candiate and caste a deciding vote for whomever they please...." I think there heartless. That's another reason why I don't like them. Now look all they care about is themselves. 
others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with 
All student should participate in some form of community service. 
The problem we face with not having a policy of each student participating in at least one after-school activity, is that we have students who are immensely talented who are not motivated enough to be a part of a club. If the school was to have this policy every student would benefit from it as they are given a far greater reason to join a club. With the various advantages of creating this policy and minor drawbacks, each school should at least make an attempt to enact a policy that would not only help students but the school as a whole. With students having the added motivation to join the clubs offered at their schools, with the added diversity to the school, there is no reason a school should make an attempt to complete a policy like this. The principal at all schools should try to implement a policy that makes students participate in the after-school offerings that their school has.  
In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.               
Driverless cars would be a good idea 
I think I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I do not think it is a good idea to use this on humans without their consent. Technology is important but I still do not think this is a good idea. 
Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. 
In 1976 something very strange was found by the Viking 1 spacecraft. It appeared to be a face on the surface of the planet Mars. With this discovery NASA scientists took further investigations into what this picture could actually be. The scientists looked at the picture and determined that it was not a face only a mesa that looked like a face because shadows were casted onto it. 
Voters int oss up[ states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign  to really listen to the competting candidatesw knowning that they are going to decide the election they are going to decide the election.    
Luke Bomberger makes the choice to go over seas to and ship horses, cows, and mules to Europe. Luke had knew this would a one time chance to go over seas with his friend, Don. They both signed up for the "Seagoing Cowboys" to watch over and care for the cows, horses, and mules while they go over sea 
Taking online classes from home provides students with a more comfortable learning environment. 
In the electoral college they avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
the value of using this technology to read students' emotional experessions is something I can agree with. 
Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best. 
The author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweigh the risks. 
In the end, She liked doing her own project without any instructions from her teacher. It made her think what she mostly remember from that year, and reflect on it. If she didn't have the confidence to do that, then who knows if she could've done it without her teacher's help. 
they might make new friends. 
Although these are all fair reasons to want to visit Venus once again, astronomers have to keep in mind all of the negative characteristics that will set their exploration behind. 
Not very many people really understand what the electoral college really is 
in India there was a kid named Generic_Name, sometime when the teacher was not in the class room. He always help his class mates, one day his teacher give them a project and he decide to do a toy little rocket, also he decide to test the rocket and it worked. And now he win the grand winner award by the President of India. 
So this is my opinion on what I think of the Face on Mars. 
Maybe if a student had the permission to use their phone in school from their parent. The teachers don't allow it but their guardian does. I think the issue should be resolved by parents and not by a student. 
The author said "the value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the opitions for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive". it not safe to send to someone int to space to venus becasue they do not know if they will be able to get them back to earth safely. for other reason, " NASA's possible solution to the hostile condititons on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling venusian landscape. with means that venus landscape it not good for people to be up ther on it surface, scientist do jnot know if there is right oxygen on that planet for humans to breath. With that"NASA is working on other approaches to study venus", because they are now thinking that it not safe for them to send humans upp to space to get data for them because they don't know what it like on that planet or how the weather , the surface is for humans to be on it. NASA is goimg to be useing technology with they call " mechanical computers" to studdy the planet here on earth. but venus is now called" the evening star brightest points of light in the night sky". 
The text states that,"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the cahos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." Scientist also say that they think the modern computres are powerful and quick to use for studies like this. It can be resistant to the heat etc. 
Some students may think its easy, but for most, it is hard. Since most of your students have a C average, then there is some bad effects on changing it to a B average 
there is no need to change the Electoral College to popular votes. Although, many Americans despise the way it works. It still manages to elect a president in an unfair way. 
Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. 
The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anchorism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president 
You should especially join if you like to see ancient artifacts such as an old castle is Crete and even the Panama Canal. 
That doesn't mean it was created by aliens and besides, we didn't find no ancient civilization on Mars 
The driverless cars could change the world in a positive way. 
At the end it matters who has majority of the electoral votewhich is 270. It'sbasically the same as how much states you've won to see who will be elected as president. 
Changing the electoral college would not be an great idea due to the fact that it has been around for centuries and would negatively impact the voting system. Some believe the voting system is a very unfair and outdated system because of the electoral college. When changing the system to popular vote it will affect many people, it may also come out worse than the electoral college. 
I think we shouldn't nchange anything at all about computers 
the development of the driverless car has come very far in the very short time that it's been around. It's already allowed for a safer experience with automated brakes, multiple sensors, and notifications to the driver when something is wrong. With even further development than what we have already, safety could eventually not be a concern at all. With that being developed, so too are ways in efficiency and cost of transportation. By being for the development of driverless cars, so many significant benefits could be here in the years to come. 
Imagine yourself in a stressful situation causing you to be confused and frustrated because you cannot form a legitimate solution. In this situation your problem may be dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you. Through everyday life, we are constantly finding ourselves in troubling circumstances. Gaining advice from multiple sources is a powerful way to combat our problems. Often, it is advice and guidance from others that provides us with the strength and expertise needed to resolve conflict. Support from friends or family and assertive words can be just what we need when dealing with a problem. 
In a young persons life, they don't want to be lonely. They want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. All these things help students grow up more healthier in life. 
Additionally, this convenience allowed her to still be able to care for my sisters and complete her online courses without the stress of attending the class in person. Undoubtedly, had she not had this easy and convenient option open to her, she would have never had the time to earn her degree 
While making a decision, it is important to seek advice from others. Being introduced to how different people would handle a situation or make a choice, can help a person make a more beneficial choice. For example, if Generic_Name would have asked three of her friends how they felt about the dating app, the scary situation in the beginning possibly could have been prevented. One friend could have told her to be careful and bring protection just in case, the other may have suggested to meet up in a public area with a numerous amount of people, and the other friend could have listed all the dangers about meeting with strangers. A couple of her friends could have mentioned to her how they would meet up with someone safely, and the other friend could have opened her mind to scary perspectives of meeting with a man online. Generic_Name would have made a better choice if she would have considered the different points of views. Be aware of who you take advice from. Always make sure the person that is introducing you to different point of views is someone you can put your trust into. 
Some of the states don't like it, because most states doesn't even see the campaign. 
This can increase the students studying skills and also they would learn more efficiently. 
Or it can let you know when it needs help and he/she is a afraid to ask. 
If we have people that have more knowlodge then us then, we can have a good President. 
Finally someone has found a way to determine someone's feelings and emtions with a simple computer program 
I would like to address a concern that seems to have the American people questioning their voting decisions. As a responible citizen of the United States of America, upholding your right to vote is an important duty. However, 
With online learning, attendance will no longer be a problem schools are forced to address. 
it was just shadows giving it the illusion of facal fitures 
My cousin did all these things on online school and failed at graduating school. He didn't get jobs that student that when to public school did. 
Cars in our society has been a benefical invention that we've had. Now that we are living in the 21st century people are worried about the negative effects that cars are contributting to. 
Cellphones and driving are as bad as drinking and driving because both can cause death. Cellphones are a huge distraction when on the road as the driver is not focused enough on the road and may cause an accident. Cellphones require humans to use both hands but may get there eye off the road. 
it would be more thought out 
According to the machine if you frown at it, the next ad will be different. 
lthough, some may still think going to your classes is a good thing i don't agree.Some students don't take school in a serous matter like other students who cares about their education;Students that don't care will most likely use online classes as their way to get out of doing work. Allowing people to have a option would be a huge change in the school system.In conclusion i believe my central idea is supported and with well given reasons.  
Another popular dilema of the electoral college is untrustworthy electors. 
Many kids will suffer majorly if a school was to go through with this ridiculous plan of forcing people to do an extracurricular activity that they do not wish to take part in. In the end, this will benefit basically nobody, because if someone really needed or wanted to participate in extra activities, they could without having to affect every person other than themselves in the school. Many would be upset with this new plan, so I believe that it would be best to keep our system the same. 
paper comes from trees and many animals and wild life have homes in trees. with electoral college one wouldnt need paper to vote, which is a paper saver. the electoral college helps a lot when it comes to selecting electors,metting of the electors and where they wil vote for the president, and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. by saving gas one is saving money which can be used for any nessessitites. 
I think that people need to go up to mars and really see what is going on. So, we can go and show everyone this there aren't any aliens, and they are just a myth. 
Students would benefit from being able to attend school from home because you can stay at home and by staying at home you can wake up late for school. 
the ability to read the students. 
It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the canidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extreamly unelikely. 
Receiving multiple opinions from different people can help out a lot. Sometimes when people ask for advice, they don't always want to follow that specific person's advice. This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people. 
i would convince people to join the seagoing cowboys program. I have stated that a its a once in a life time chance to have. Also they could help out other people by doing so. And you'll be aware about others people's needs despite your own. So i would convience others to join. 
When a child in trouble or something they need a cell phone to call someone. 
Many teenagers have their phones as their top priority. Many of them are on them all the time even while driving. Texting while driving is one of many causes of death in the United States. These young 16 year olds don't understand that not only are they putting their life in danger but they are putting the person beside them, in front of them, and behind them in danger. 
Bogota and colombia set out as a program to spread out the car-free day leaving the sreets of this capital city clear of no traffic jams. The goal for this countries is to promote traspotantion and reduce the smog. The violators for these rules are going to be charged with 25% fine. Uneven  sidewalks have been replaced by broad (smooth sidewalks), Rush our restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upsacle  shopping districs  have croped up. 
The electoral college is a process, not a place that what i've read. The founding fathers established it in the constitution between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizen. The electoral college consists of 538 elctors. a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors 
Also i think because if we were to use our cell phones we would pay more attention to our phones then our work, and also it will be ringing and disturbing the class when most students wanna learn. 
The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. 
Cellphones being used while driving should be given a huge ticket fine and be given court for putting their lives and someone else live in danger or should even be put behind bars. Cellphones should be put on do not disturb when operating a motor vehicle. 
If the student picks they will be more willing to do it . Much rather if the teacher designed the project for the students . They will learn more picking their own designe and enjoy it more if it is their own design 
so can everyone can join play video games and everyone plays online and play your friends and other people and some people don't play online because iit thinks it is so bad to play and it think is and for your eyes and it thinks you can get color blind and it has bad words on the council and they have other people abuse other people as will. 
Another reason why asking multiple people for advice is good is that some people might give you more advice then others. 
With the Electoral College, there is also the risk that electors may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president. 
If you're going to make a claim about something you must first have evidence to back-up that claim or it can't be taken as fact, but it doesn't make it untrue or true until there is evidence proving it. Instead of following what you think is true, which is based on opinion because you have no evidence, follow where the evidence leads because you will discover things that you have never knew before. 
we can see them and there homes on our monitors the camera is called the Mars Global Suveryor an dby the intension of that shuddle we can see all things big or small. 
i believe that the people who are trying to go to venus or sent something to venus should do it because you never know what other kids of things are out there and if we dont try news things we wont discover new stuff . 
but research shows that 90% of students that perform community service will be doing themselves and there neighborhoods good !Experts agree that doing community service will help the world ! 
The final reason that i think forced community service is not a good idea is because kids need sleep. 
Teachers would be able to learn more of their students and improve on their curriculums in order to satisfy the needs of their students. 
Then they can go and talk to the principal and see if they can add a new activity. But if not then they donÃÂ´t have to do it. 
The electoral collage is overall unfair to voters becuse of the winner takes all system in each state 
For one it will look good on the students diplomas for college 
To all of the girls out there we all get into bad relationships. I can tell you I have had many of them in my life. We all fall for that cute,pretty, and sinister smile on their face. I have seen it so many times it's unreal to belive that once we say yes we fall into their plan to take our hearts and just tear them to shreds. Boys can be like that. They plan to trap us and never let us go to see the bright beam of love again. Until you meet another one who is more caring and loving and you start to feel that sensation you used to feel and you know you found the right one. 
No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. 
The second reason is many people have stressful jobs and they attend a conference call or any stressful situations in the family front while driving. This can distract their mind from driving and even the hands-free driving Law can't be helpful to prevent car wrecks. 
make an overall smarter choice. 
where the people do have a chance to vote and their vote is seen as a popular vote , but it seems like the electors votes count more than the peoples. 
"The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor. 
The author uses many details from the article to support his claim that Venus is worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents by telling the reader how dangerous Venes is. 
Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving, for the reason that the use of a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle is exceedingly hazardous for the driver, as well as others who are traveling along the same road. 
I think that people should be able  to use there own car when they to for there to get around aleats lower gas prices so people want be in there cars much as they u to be. Some people need to use there cars for the onlu way for transpartion to get doctors and dentisis appoinments 
You cant join clubs,go to fun pep rallies, or even go on field trips. Going to school may seem boring and useless but it gives you experience, especially with adult figures. Online classes dont offer sports so if you wanted to join a sport you cant through a computer, unless you are playing online. Once you get out of school you will miss it. It is a great time to explore who you are and who you want to be. 
Doing extracurricular activities can help make friends 
Lets take a look at the present. President Obama who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes since were a large state we get more votes. take a look at map where its shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes, it shows each state. many small state have less than 5 electoral votes simply because its not huge, but yet again you're voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors 
Autonomous vehicles would save lives and money. With a computer at the wheel, cars could find the most efficient and safe route to almost any destination. Greenhouse gas emmisions would be reduced, therefore making our planet a better place to be. 
Do you think that we should have school activites? 
One example that tells you why it isnt an alien artifact is the shadows. The only way the messa (face on the moon) was able to have facial features was because of the shadows that was cascading down upon it. The shadows gave an illusion of eyes, a nose, and also a mouth 
large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states 
In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment 
but I belive that those people are just parnoid pessmist and need to learn to have more faith in the people that we elect or the president appoints. 
in-car entertaining. 
What I'm trying to say is that you should not tell students to do community service. You don't know what they have going on in their lives. They could be a professional basketball player. 
As a response to this, I argue that students should be the ones designing these projects 
We can use it to play a game, watch a movie, or listen to music to help us relax. From the text states, "the same technology cab make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery." 
Do you really think aliens exist? It is belived by some that on mars aliens shaped a type of face on the planet. Others belive it is just a natural land form with a funny shape that looks like a face. 
One that could maybe could go under ground and have something stick out from the ground every once in awhile. Maybe even one that could stay in the water of the plant. If we can build a ship that can with stand all of Venuses wearher. Than we could study it freely. 
These new cars have challeges to overcome and these challeges are the reason some oppose the idea 
The author also shares with us and writes that Nasa's possible solution to exploring or studying this amazing planet without having to touch the surface 
By also keeping the electoral college we make it so their is no chance of a tie. Like if a person from the electoral college were to betray his state. 
Learning occurs when one gains knowledge on things they did not know beforehand, so if they work on topics they are fond of, no learning will take place. In addition, students may not want to expand upon what they already know and challenge themselves because it is summer break, their time to be free. They are likely to do the minimum in order to be done so it leaves available time for more road trips and vacations. 
Electoral colleges can really mess things up because when you vote you vote for somyone who wouldnt even be in the public office 
What is wrong with the yearbook. What are they going to do with the yearbook because all you have to do is set the students that took there picture in alphabetical order. What will they do when there done with It.There not going to let a lot of people do it because you don't need half the school. Plus It's going to be hard if everyone wants to do the yearbooks. 
The three reasons why they should keep it is because, its not fair 
Kids have less pressure to get work done. 
FACS can be extremely useful in schools all over the world 
Others say, that aliens made this formation. 
the surfce was rockey and couldnt be walled on because of that reason or drove on there was mountains and craters furthermore. the nationL aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. 
Moreover, in source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, "The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we might call the diaster factor. 
Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them. 
One it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face 
The only way i think it is a good idea to have that kind of tecnology inside school is if it has its own room inside the school. That way all the kids that want to use the computer can use it. 
time is something that passes all the time 
Every summer break, students are given projects in certain classes to make sure they continue to improve over the break.These projects handed out to the students are always made by the teachers, but what if we change that? 
the law doesn't agree with it either. 
Many students in the world are placed with the issue of whether or not it would be beneficial to actually attend school in a brick and mortar setting. Some find it beneficial, allowing the students to have a taste of freedom an independence in their work environment, while others think of it as an excuse to stay home and slack off. Pushing that agenda forward, many schools offer students the opportunity to take some of their classes off campus at a different location such as a community college campus or even in the comforts of their own homes. With that being said, more students are choosing to take their classes at different locations instead of the traditional setting. 
they can go home after school, and have no work with a tutors help. The tutor would feel good at the end since the student they helped enjoyed the help of the work, and also enjoy meeting someone new to them. 
After reading this, i do not stand behind the electoral college.    
In all I think people should ask for advice and at least 3 people before making a decision so it doesn't come back to knock you down and slow life down for you, so no one will get mad over the decision your making and ask a professional before saying yes or no to see if the job will be good for you. Because we all want the best for eachother if someone does ask you for advice tell them what you think and how you feel because later you might need to ask them for advice. That is why you should always ask for more then 1 person for advice and ask for advice or help in general. 
The text also say "then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instctors". That is one of only many thing it can do by helping the teachers by better understanding the classroom.It could do all of that by " Classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness" by accociated with characteristic movements of facial muscles. 
The elector college is a controversial subject today in america, based on many questionable policies that leave many americans confused and cheated. 
The "winner-takes-all" system is when all electors are awarded to the winning presidential candidate. This helps when it comes down to what is fair and what isn't. 
What will they do with the student council. I don't think this is a good idea at all because hoe are they going to go threw the whole school for whatever they have to say to every individual student. It might take a while for a lot of students or it might be quick. It's going to be hard because some people are good and don't need it. 
Just before the bell rings to dismiss students for year, teachers are struggling to keep the attention of students when explaining their summer assignments for the break. The students know that the summer assignments are important, but their attention is on the bell that declares summer vacation. Summer assignments are designed to ensure that students continue their intellectual journey over breaks. Both teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects accomplish this goal, however, one of the biggest challenges is deciding whether teacher-designed projects or student-designed project would do a better job at accomplishing this goal 
First of all, the Electoral College is regarrded as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be over powered by declaring the canidate who gets the most popular votes the winner. 
Sparkling lights filled the room while blush colored flowers made a trail down the isle. The room had a peachy aroma. People slowly entered the church and the murmurs of voices were filling the air. Generic_Name was in the back dressing room getting her large, white gown fitted on her body. She was getting married to the love of her life. Generic_Name was a dove. Generic_Name was graceful and delicate. Nobody could ruin her day"Generic_Name its almost time to walk," Generic_Name's father called out. She could hear the soft music playing. Butterflies fluttered around in her stomach. She could not believe how almost four months ago she was going to meet up with a man from a dating website. The thought made her body cringe. If she would have went on that date, she would have never met her soon to be husband. Generic_Name was in love and happier than she had ever been. She was so glad she listened to the opinions and advice from her friends and family. 
The electoral college is a great process with the votes in congress and a vote of the qualified cictizens. It is more organized with five benifits of certainity of outcome, trans- regonal appeal, winner-take-all method, big states, and avoiding run-off elections. These benifits help the elections go more smoothly. The Electoral College process has a selection of electors that vote for president and vice president, and the counting of electoral votes by congress. 
Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom? 
Seeking out multiple opinions helps people make the best choices 
limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing. 
After that , everyone was not satisfied. The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north and was winter in april 1998 - a cloudy time of year. The camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. 
More cars are going to make and more style are going to make; but I also want to be safe when I'm in a car. 
Drivers should not have cell phones 
the author tells us about some details about the temperatures, 
It it was made by aliens there wouldn't just one face on the planet. 
if one occured, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors. 
In my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service 
For example, in the passageWhat Is An Electoral College?by the Office of the Federal Register it states that " The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.." This means that most states have a "winner-take-all" for the winning candidate's. 
Internet crashes 
But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. 
My last reason is by the way they look 
Lets say there is a tie. Then every state would have only 1 vote meaning the little state of Delaware would have as much say as the huge state of California. This example is the complete opposite of doing what the people want.This means the 35 million people have as much say as the 500,000 or sol in Delaware. 
Although the Electoral College should be abolished for there dispicable disision making,there just choosing a way to get a better prisident. 
with this you have so many advantages like being able to tell if a student likes a lesson or is bored with it. 
because not all the time do the people of the state deserve to pick and choose who they think they like. 
Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? It comes down to the facts. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. So what makes it silly to some? You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. 
There are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree:1. Certainy of outcome 2. Evryone's president 3. Swing states 4. Big states 5. Avoid run-off elections 
it states that president Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elctoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes casted for him and Mitt Romney. 
It would be really strange if a computer can tell you if your happy or sad. 
Imagine sitting through a class where every single student presented with a slide show; It's so simple that a baby could make the same project. Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject. 
There were no people, airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even any small shacks anywhere near the landform 
Another excuse is that the price to participate in these activities is too much. 
Despite the benefits of student-designed projects, those who favor ones designed by teachers point to the fact that teachers can base projects off the curriculum students will have to learn during the school year and thus help students feel more prepared. 
The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. 
As well as other presidents could be telling the truth and saying all of this stuff saying that one day they will make people stop paying taxes and poeople right away will thinck ohhh yess no taxes lets vote for this guy wile really they can do that but they will rise the prices on everything and then people will get mad agian. 
The Electoral College should be kept 
Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible. 
The electoral college was established as a compromise between election of the President by congress, and election of the President by popular citizen vote. The founding fathers felt it would given congress too much power if it elected the President all by itself. They also felt if citizens chose the seat by themsleves there wouod be chaos. They decided on a nice in between; they both choose, well sort of. What many citizens do not know is that when they cast their vote, they are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President. 
So no Senator you and your fellow peers whom decided to eliminate electoral votes is dispicable. When we actually have a chance to vote you take it away. Its very clear that without the electoral votes it woud be more than just presidental complication it would also be complication with decideing electors, presidntal electors and the big states who canidates get there precious votes from would have a hard time winning.I agree to keeping the Electoral College vote and not to change it to no popular vote because popular vote over rules most of the time. So please over think your decsion with other senators and keep Electoral College votes.    
some students have a c grade average and are on many of the sports hear at school some work very hard for that c because school is guest to hard for them. i bet if it was there choice they would have a A or a B. But not everyone has the same brain so school will be difficult for some student than others. 
Other students, and sometimes teachers, are simply just added distractions that make it even more difficult for students to focus on learning the information that the teacher is trying to teach to the class 
My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing. 
Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Projects are used to enhance learning in a different way. During the summer no student wants to work on school work or even think about school. 
because it at home and it can be eays for the students to work on the class. In school it can be hired for some kids in the classrooms it can be claing for them like in fert of thr class things like at. But home schools or online class can be good in a way no people are alone no laged studnts. 
there are less distractions in schools, 
but if the majority of the people are represnted, then that's all that matters. 
Driverless cars are a great investment and idea for our country to encourage. 
Do you like to travel around the world? Well if you do you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
when you get good advice just take it 
We all want to be on are phones every minute and every second but here are some facts that will make you think twice before picking up the phone. Approximately 600,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile. 
Everyday more children are put in home education programs due to the many issues with the present school systems. Safety of the student always is most important in any learning environment and one of the safest places for a student is within the walls of their own home. External conflicts with other students is prevented because students will not be given the opportunity to interact with one another outside of hearing one or two of them ask a question. Since the student is at home they can eat or wrap themselves up in a blanket or sit in some comfortable clothes while learning to excercise the comfortability of learning at home 
Some may say it's unjustice or not fair because the House Of Representatives decides the whole election. There is also the fact that when determining the winner, they both look at the popular votes and the electoral votes, and they see who got the most electoral votes and they win the election. 
Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students 
Besides some people dont want you to know hoe they feel one day or maybe at all. 
In conclusion, some students may not be able to attend online school because of eletricity problems or the student doesn't have a computer at home. 
The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote 
Now in the end do you not agree with or what that we the people should be the ones to pick the president and not us be the ones to vote for who we think would represent us best and vote and pick the president for us. 
To get ready for high school you are going to need a good GPA score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. Getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher GPA. Sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done. 
THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that. This is evidence of why NASA won't leak anything so people do not know the truth. 
An extracurricular doesn't just make kids happier, students can meet a lot of people and make new friends.Doing an extracurricular activity will help people branch out, meet new people, and make new friends, possibly some important ones 
but they might also not want to do sports because of their grades 
cause it going to take away time from them to be them and take away their socail life with theie friend and not help them get a good thing coming from them as in with sport or if they wanted to join a club to that they like with the schoo cause wouldnt know how to get in it if they not phycically in school . 
The electoral college is unfair , outdated and also irrational. 
Just to go to Mars is a lot, but to go there and get evidence from there and bring it to Earth is a lot. It also can effect the way back to Earth and be dangerous. They don't stop at Cydonia so they would have to plan it out and get all the supplies they would need to get there and get the evidence they need. 
It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not. There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has alot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it or they can be wrong.        
When they see all the amazing sights: caring for the animals and, how they are making new friends, and caring for others. 
more people will stop getting ticket from police. 
Driverless cars used to be just a dream. Now that we have the technology to make "driverless cars" there seem to be more and more of a concern as to how these cars could be completely driverless. 
Some people do say The electoral vote is for the better. " The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. 
So do you understand where i'm coming from with this. So keep it easy just let the electoral college stay around. 
First off, the author tells what Venus is like. 
and they need to put their cell phones on vibrate or turned off but students don't want to put their phones in their lockers cause they get stolen which they get mad and they need to buy another one. 
But, big states lose virtue by population. For example Obama who won the vote only got twenty nine electoral votes out of the state of Florida. In Wyoming he only got three electoral votes so this means that larger states get payed more attention than the smaller states do. 
Venus, sometimes called the "Evening star" it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky that is amazing. Well Venus is actually a planet.Venus is called the "Evening star" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple from the distant but safe vantage point of earth it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closley. Often referred to as Earth"twin" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occcasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Marsour other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times in Venus. Maybe this is issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than threendecades. Numerous factors contribute to Vensu reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. 
I think that is very interesting for the students because this is for that we have a good future in the life is important when we find a reason for our future but we can be good students when we study more, also because the schools need more students with interest in the school for make a good future because the school is the most important for each student and many time only some students have the opportunity of take the class in home, and this is important in the future when the student work hard each day for a better future,and also never wait that the others study for us because we are student is the most important is give every our effort. I think that this is important endeavor each day for our future better because not there anymore better in the life that the study, also having a good benefit from the school. 
Cars can be useful in many ways but for the better of the enviorment, peoples cities, and sanity, little to no car use is the way to go.         
I don't believe that a want a car watching me when i know its somebody else video taping me and my family. Think of how akward that would feel having a computer watch your every move in your car. 
Stress and anxiety among students is extremely high.Many kids have test anxiety and are not able to perform well in testing environments.Testing anxiety can be caused by numerous factors but one factor that stands out the most is feeling comfortable in an environment.If the student does not feel comfortable in their classroom while taking a test, they will not produce a good grade.If the student is placed in a well suited environment, like their home, they are guaranteed to receive a better grade than if they were placed in a classroom.Secondly, if students are able take their time and not rush through school work, stress levels will reduce and the amount of passing students will increase.Students often feel rushed to finish in a short amount of time in order to please their teachers.Although many teachers preach to their students to take their time, teachers unknowingly put a time restriction on student.Online courses allow kids to start and finish assignment when they feel comfortable doing so.Online classes lowers the chance of stress among students by eliminating classroom anxiety. 
I think the author thinks studying Venus is worthy based of the author saying in Paragragh five althought it is 170° F(Fahrenheit) it may be difficultt condtions, but it still survivable for humans. 
This systen includes various methods like the "winner take all" system that gives the presidency to the winning candinate of the eletors votes 
Students needed at home would never be able to participate in the activities after school. 
a great opportunity of a lifetime to join the program. 
principle, i think students should have to do community service, 
"What about the people who work in car companies?" 
; there are many cases where large classrooms actually cripple a student's potential 
the life they believe was once their making it a plave they want to explore. 
Another reason that community service is very important, is because many ivy league colleges, and other colleges in general, are always looking for people who regularly participate in community service and also volunteer. 
My company would also like to state that this really "isn't" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA belive this isn't alien. Just another simularity between Mars and Earth.  
One downside is that it can give out a students business and if like a student is sad, it can become a joke to the other students and make that student even more sad. 
Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation. 
Nearly over 78% of students participate in after school or extracurricular activities in the US as of today. 
in overall i agree, i think that students should do extracurricular activity 
we should't have something that doesn't express our right of speech in political. 
Some evidence that i saw in this passage of how Venus would be dangerous is that 97% of venus is covered in carbon dioxcide and it ca melt a submarine that goes in our deepest oceans. Also every other spacecraft that landed on Venus only survied a couple of hours. 
one thing is known as a world wide factor that applies to almost everything that we do. Simpler, is better. 
Doing community helps everyone, including oneself and the ones around them. 
Classes nationwide usually have a required summer assignment. Whether it is reading a book, solving math equations, or writing a paper. The teachers hand pick and choose certain tasks for each subject. Teachers give out homework to keep their students always in check of their knowledge. 
Most states have a winner-take-all system that  awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate." This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country 
For example, I was writing a paper for one of my classes and was struggling due to the topic of my subject. I went and asked my classmates for better topics and one of them had an amazing idea for my topic. I then used it for my essay and received an outstanding grade of one hundred out of one hundred. My second example was when my friend asked me for help on a project he was assigned and was struggling on. I told him an idea that could be great for his project which led to him receiving an A as his grade. My third example was when I needed to help to win a video game competition. I asked my friends and watched videos on great ways and strategies to win this competition and applied what I learned from them to the competition and won first place. Lastly, I was participating in a sports tournament and was doing terrible and asked my coach what I could do to improve. He gave me a few tips and points that I used to win and be the MVP of the tournament. 
I think this is a good idea so that students will be more involved in their community 
My final claim that the Face on Mars is a mesa lies in the fact that, if the Face really was an alien monument, NASA would not keep their lips tight about it. It would make global headlines, and shock the world. 
So therefore drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. It is a distraction. It is one of the leading causes for car accidents. It is also a very expensive ticket so I encourage drivers to stay away from their phones while driving. Unless you absolutely need to use it. 
So what I am trying to say is you never know if its safe. 
Astronomers curiosty is whats going to help us learn about things and planets besides earth. Woudn't you want to learn more about our world even though theres going to be a little difficutly during the way? Maybe one day scientist can overcome these small problems and learn more about the Atmosphere. I think Astronomers are going to take on that challenge. Remember anythings possible if you put your mind to it, and thats what Astronomers are doing. 
Imagine visiting a planet like ours, maybe it was just like ours at a point where it could have living animals, water, and maybe even trees. Venus has the type of look because it the only plant that looks more like our planet the Earth. 
Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how "The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century; the system allows for much worse." and "that those elctors could always defy the will of the people." in Par. 9 "according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al-Gore-Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency." Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote. 
when making a decision, asking for multiple opinions is extremely beneficial. 
The increase in moral for these students would give them a more enjoyable learning environment and the excitement of a new school year starting so that they're able to share their work with someone else who will appreciate it. 
. Asking only one person for advice also doesn't give you options. It narrows your mindset, so you only see one side of the issue. 
i think its a great way to refresh your mind a little and then go back to work. 
Even though there are many things stopping us from living on Venus now, there are still many things that we do not know about the Earth's twin. There is still so much more to explore on Venus. But for now we know that the air pressureis similar to Earths sea level pressure, it is close to the sun having pleanty of solar power, and is once believed to have oceans and support life. And one day Venus might need to become our new home. But until then, the human race will stay on Earth. 
like vote on a piece of paper and put it in this huge box and mail that huge box to someone who can talley up the votes so he can get them or something like that. how can we improve the system in a way everybody can join like a website or a likely matter. The president votes only need 29 electoral votes to win. Why not everybody votes not electoral votes. 
If there are no more of the planets then we could go to Venus, but we should explore others first to see if they are more suitable for people to live on. 
Even after succeeding in information given, the author fails to promote the idea that travel to Venus is worth all the cons. 
But a good thin about this article is that it says that president obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states ' greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week will get a fortuitous assist. So basically wat it is trying to say is that eventually a end to cars will come. Since 2005  the number of miles drive have dropped steadily after. over the years people have stooped relying on cars. 
I am writing this letter to convince you that you should not do this policy change. 
Virtual schooling allows students to access the same education as physical students while being away from the actual school. Schools should utilize this new type of schooling 
Teachers who are unfamiliar with the students and their circumstances may overestimate the students and create a project that is too difficult for students to complete on their own. They might also design a project that students do not have the ability to complete-if a teacher were to assign an essay on what a student learned by traveling, a low-income student may not be able to do it if their family cannot afford to travel. Students are more familiar with their own abilities and resources and can create a project that will provide a good challenge while not being too confusing or difficult. Reaching out for assistance would also be easier, as confused students could reach out to their peers instead of a teacher they do not know. Teachers are prone to creating a project that may be difficult or impossible to students they are unfamiliar with, but students are able to design ones based on their own abilities and resources. 
it is unfair to the people 
I hope my words help out community's who are thinking about putting Extracurricular Activity's in there School system. I truly agree with these activity's and think it will help a lot with kids/teens. I hope one day all schools have fun activities for there students. I think can help many students come out into the real life and show them the true meaning of life. I love this idea so much and wish the best of luck for community with these activities. 
some people can get so caught up in a decision that they forget that it is not just affecting themselves 
Some people believe that election by popular vote is better, 
Clubs like "We the People" are great for those who are interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for exercise, to no one's surprise. They are a wonderful way of expanding horizons, making friends and exploring new things. 
In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President". This shows that when all the votes are tallyed up theirs no need to go through so much problem, when their's basically a rubric to go over the electors and the electoral votes. For example, if this wasn't invented, we would have our own people just sit their on long day and nights. Without any sleep and count all those votes. This could lead to alot of miscounts. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the presidnet of the United States. 
not distraction with other students and more distraction in home sometime not focus some students said 5% the students not focus in house because the cell phones distract the students not benefit being able to attend classes from home.The some students story and online because in the morning not necessary take a shower or not wake up late, but some students is more fanny story in school because distract 
The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidental elections off of popular votes. 
by making the internet a better way to communicate, having funner ways to transport yourself, and making it easier to access stores. Getting in a car to go to a freinds house is in most cases is a long stressful process that can be eliminated through a culture without cars that opens up Internet use to communicate instead. "She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends" (Rosenthal paragraph 35). Mimi Sheller is explaining how you don't have to get into a car to be with your friends and that the Internet is a simplier option. Instead of using a car to get to work, it may be a healthier and funner option for people to start walking or riding a bike. " 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife" (Rosenthal paragraph 24). In the quote, Carlos describes how stress is relieved by lower pollution and opening yourself up to activities that you and someone you love could enjoy while getting to work. Stress can be driven by simple things in life such as trying to find a parking spot to access the market. "In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). To have less stress in your life it could be easier to live in a no cqar community that makes any store you need only a walk away from your house leaving you free of the harshness of finding a parking spot. Internet communication, alternate transportation, and walk ways to stores make a happier and healthier life for the average person. 
They are working on other ways to study Venus 
is very unfair, 
summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.Students do not want the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about what they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow. 
even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions"(like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion - recognition software tracks theese facial movements- ina real face or on the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identitfy mixed emotions(as in da Vinci's master piece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). 
Although you would be sacrificing the basic one to one classic learning situation where teacher and student are face to face, it is still attainable to teach away from home 
It says in paragraph two that venus is drapped in clouds and that the un manned ships that have been send did not last more that 2 hours. 
Helping the elderly can help them. Maybe their too weak to carry their own bags and they need help. A lot of elderly people now a days are dying because their trying to do chores they can't really do but they have to do because no one is their to help them do them. 
Cell phones are extremely distracting because of the large amount of focus operating one requires. 
In the second paragraph, the author states "...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." 
I know it is something important for everybody to do ,but it is also important for you to understand that some people just don't have the time or just don't want to do it. 
On the other hand, some argue that students will use the distance learning less as a tool, but more as a crutch, so that they don't have to attend classes and can stay home whenever they want. People believe that the longer that students are required to show up and are given less options to make it up at home ,the more drive to show up at school will be seen. 
In addition, stress levels in students will significantly decrease. 
what we could do is replace gas cars with water or oil solarpowered cars. what we can do is replace the road with heat sensor pannels and replace the cars fuel line with eigther a solar based power syatem or used water for the fuel supply. 
If they every change the system to popular votes for the president it would be a honest choice 
It says "moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them''. I think that is very true and hopefully it would make people more happy and not feel like they are nothing. 
It can be argued that the electoral college methods of choosing electors is bad 
some schools are better then some schools in the county of virgina. 
we can even go and buy cloth and give it to poor children that need it. i know that there is maybe more than 10 kids this really need cloth and food, i know because two years ago i went on vacation to Mexico and I was being really selfish. My dad took me to an orphanage and i got to see how the poor kids lived in that horrible place and I imagine how it wold be if i lived there. 
First of all I think it removes our voting right as an American citizen 
Having the option to attend class at home has many benefits for students, and would help to raise many students GPA's, due to the flexibility that the distance learning would offer. 
for those who do not know what a mesa is a mesa is kind of like a landform made by dirt been blown by the wind. 
First the text states ¨ These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, such an enviorment wuld crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.¨(Paragraph 3) 
School is a requirement for all children and young adults in the country, so distance learning would be beneficial to any students who are unable to attend. 
The first reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that one person could know more about the situation than others. 
"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favo of itare mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections ae spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dle was right: Abolish the electoral college!" 
It could be anything like helping you with building somethin or perhaps makeing dinner and hangging out. All i kmow is it would be the right thing to do. You could be the one who wants to do them a favor or they do you a favor and you want to help them in a way. 
I know that getting advice from more than one person is one of the best things you can do, is because it have done it in my life, and i have had some rewarding benefits. I had to do a project for school, where I had to make a model that displayed what I had learned in that unit. I did not really know what I was going to do, so I asked my parents. They helped me come up with an idea, but the rest was up to me. I then came to ask my older friend, who had done this project before. He helped me come up with how I was going to make it, and display it with confidence to the class. When all was said and done, I got an A on the project. Afterward, I pondered what I did in order to get the good grade. I remembered that I had sought the opinion and ideas of 3 different people, and I had done the very best I could have done. In the future, I would remember that project, and how rewarding it was to get help from multiple people. 
It is completely unfair to force students to partake in an activity. 
With having the first reason listed as being "Certainty of Outcome" should really make the person reading that question themselves on if they're making a right decision or not. You would have too go through a lot of trouble and paperwork as it is whenever voting for someone, At least I would like too know that I'm not basically giving my one vote away for technically someone else to do it for me.    
After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons.                 
Hi, this is one of a student from the SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to talk about the policies our school is having. The policy that i will be talking about is the cell phone policy. 
It is important to listen to others opinions so you can form your own. Humans can do so much more when they put their minds together. Getting many perspectives from other people and putting them together to form the best decision is the best way to do it. It is imperative that your choice reflects what many people say, and not just one. There are so many different opinions to be heard. 
maybe they wanna study and they can't come. i know people in west virginia. they don. t go school because the school is like 1 hours and they don't have transportation. and if all the school in united state have the program they can help a lot of familys and they cxan open a lot of doors for the people. 
The computer could analzye the students face, see any confusion, and change the lesson plan into what the individual student needs. This is all plausible because the text omits that the technology "could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This could make jobs easier for teachers, and increase the future generations knowledge by teaching them more than a human could. 
but they don't know what it's all about. 
People today are probably wondering how much these cars cost, do they have insurance, what happens if i have an accident or are the cars even safe 
On my opinion the Electoral Vote should be changed in order for people to vote for the president they want. 
Why would i want to do what the second source says and vote for a guy to vote for who i want to vote for 
she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed. 
I honestly think that being able to read student emotion is awsome in all but its kinda personal. i dont think people want other people know about their emotions. 
Now I get what the article says about driverless cars use less fuel than a normal one, and "Driving fun in a new way".Having a driverless car would be pretty cool. Getting into a car and typing in where you want to go and the car just taking you there. Or just telling it what to do due to voice actiivation. 
Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly being side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Powerball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text. 
If the person researches and ends up compiling a ton of inaccurate information, that won't help them at all. This is very likely as many sources online can be inaccurate. Although 
I think people are going crazy. People are watching to many cartoons and they are starting to think that aliens are real. People on talk shows, books, and magazines are talking about it. There is a face on mars and they think it's aliens creating them. 
what if something would happen to you? You could have got hurt, need a ride home, or maybe going to a friends house. I agree that students should have cell phones at school during their free time. Like lunch, pe, but they should turn them off during class time. If you get caught texting or someone calling you during class they should just take it up until you pay for it. The cost should be $15 dollars. When you are working or taking a test, the teacher should take the phone up, then give it to you at the end of the class period. 
Driverless cars need a whole lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a hiltop that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry ect 
The text states, " Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile," (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it 
We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a "winner-take-all" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said "Abolish the Electoral College!". Source two was right we need to put an end to the Electoral College system!  
I think driverless cars sound like a good idea on paper, but in the real world they just are not far enough advanced yet for me to feel safe being in or around one.They are not even fully driverless yet, a person still needs to be ready to take the wheel at any given time.However in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potentialy prevent accidents. 
venus is the only plante that scintest studyed to see if humans can live in 
Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. They could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. Or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with. 
A small, but very important thing teachers have in common is that they have a lesson plan. A lesson plan is what teachers utilize to understand what curriculum they will teach and how they will teach it. As a result, the teacher can use the curriculum as their foundation of the project. For example, the International Baccalaureate, IB, program requires students to complete a Summer Reading Project. As an IB student, I had to complete it this past summer. We had a list of books to choose from, and we had to write an essay about the message of the book and make a poster about what we learned from the book. What I didn't realize, was that the book had a connection to what we were going to learn in class. The project helped the students make a connection to the class and learn faster and more efficiently. This results would not be possible, if a student designed the project so this is why summer project should be designed by a teacher. 
This why I think we should keep the Electoral College and not change over to the popular voting method.                                    
But that is why you learn about your electors and who they want so you choose the one whon is going for you which is your president. Its as easy as doing a little research to find out who your really electing for as president of the U.S. 
By voting for a presidential canidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors who vote for the presidental canidate. 
So to a small extent students would benefit from being able to attend class from home, because this would let them learn at their own pace as well as in their best learning technique. 
In SCHOOL_NAME, the population of litter is huge.Students here think after using an object and its time to dispose it, it belongs on the ground.All students at SCHOOL_NAMEshould take part and help.Making our school look better will be a big helping hand. 
We need to help other community, we don't care if they going to help us or not. 
Many students dislike completing summer projects during their vacation time. After working hard in school, they look forward to relaxing and giving their brain a rest. It is vital that we do not mentally burnout, however, it is also important that we keep our brain somewhat active during summer break. This is why students are often given summer work. There are many different types of summer projects. Some projects are more traditional, being solely focused on reading and writing. On the contrary, some assignments are hands on, designed to test students' creativity. 
but it would more or less show when taking a test without knowing the required knowledge that they just took off of the internet 
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author suggetst that studing Venus is worthy but also dangerous. 
Many famous people who became famous for their work of whatever expertise they acquired usually didn't ask for just one specific person's idea. They saw many people's criticism to something that they made, and they improved their idea gradually, such asThe Simpsons.When they first made the main characters, it seemed to be poorly drawn and the voices were weird, but as the episodes went on and on, the characters and voices had smoothed out and improved to what they are today. Having one person to ask for your opinion can sometimes be just the right thing to make your project approved by one person other than you, but sometimes asking other people can give you many more perspectives to look at, giving you an upgraded idea for the one you just had 
Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself. 
Some people may say that the bigger states are helpful with voting because the Electoral College will balance out what the large states loss by the population votes. 
Another good reason for having to do activities is you could find out that your really good at something 
not always do we get control whom we vote for , it all depends on the state. 
A mother of two who is also a media trainer name Heidrun Walter gave her honest opinion of this "car-banning".  "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."  Another man name David Gold berg, an offical of Transportation for America said "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. 
The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same. 
When someone shares their wisdom with you, it can alter the way you think or perceive things. All it takes is a wise individual to share their thoughts and advice with you, for you to make a better choice. Generic_Name could have possibly talked to her mother, or a wise person in her life and asked them for their intake or thoughts about her dating app situation. Gaining advice from someone who is wiser than you can make you deeply consider your choices. If a wise person in Generic_Name's life would have told her not to force relationships or just wait on your true love to appear, she would have deleted the app and been patient. When you look up to someone, especially if their wise, you take what they say into a deeper understanding. When gaining wisdom from others,take it into deep consideration. 
Electoral College should be abolished 
My opinion would have to be Policy 2 
forces people to compromise. 
Those who are able to form close social bonds with people through school is a reason why students benefit much more by physically going to school rather than an online video call or conference. 
It's always better to stay safe than to say sorry. When people are in a tough situation, it's always good to have people behind you. Getting the opinions of others gives you multiple people to turn to in case you need them. 
Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. 
The author says that the Mona Lisa demonstrates is really to bring a smile to peoples face while it shows how much the computer can do. 
Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other enviromental effects have plauged the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. 
I do understand that the Electoral College is a process from my readings ofWhat is the Electoral College.This process should be expanded to the states all across the U.S.A 
plus it is good exercise 
We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by. Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on. No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours. This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned. 
In conclusion Venus is like earths sister and if we can find a way to make it liveable to humans we should try it. 
and the voting electors are not voting percisely. 
I think the you should follow the second phones at school because they can lose their phone. 
The reason why I am writing about this is because there are a lot of things wrong with the Electoral College 
the driverless car can provide really good safety features. 
These landforms are common on this planet as well. 
Also the Author says that the Facial Action Coding System computers can Deteced when you are happy or when you are sad.In Paragraph 4 it says that each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. Also it says that it can scan movements in a real face or in the the painted face of Mona Lisa. Plus it can be used for a video as well that show a new emotion with the software. 
After the presidential election, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors. the state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national.    
as he gives only one vague reason to explore it, 
because this nation called the united sates is a democracy it is ruled for the people and by the people, when the government descides to go by the electoral college votes thats not ruling by the people because our nation dosent only consists of 538 electors we each have our own voices. we consists of 50 states all together if the government cant conduct electoral colleges in each state then it shouldnt be around in the first, we the people all have different opinions and outlooks on the universe it shouldnt only be counted for about 538 electors it unfair. and god knows where the electoral colleges are held and if they are being completely fair to everyone their are their all ethnicities from all over the nation, is it normal people that have nine to five jobs so they understand the struggles of an average person making 60,000 dollars a year, or are they picking business men and housewives that live in suburben neighborhoods. The nation have been completely blind sided by these things its just a scapegoat on picking the right president in their eyes and not in the peoples eyes. 
We can give them things like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and look out for them and they always will need someone there. 
Another example of why attending online classes is easy and more convenient is when I was already late for class and then I got stuck in traffic on the way to my Spanish 3 class, resulting in me missing the entirety of the class. Had I been registered for the same class but online, I would have never missed the Spanish 3 final exam. For these reasons, online classes can be much easier, convenient, and beneficial when dealing with life's daily obstacles. 
This concludes why we should use popular vote.    
sometimes being in a sport helps students to have better concentration and energy, which will cause them to be better in school. 
and i dont think many people could just to get to work it may take and 1 hour- 30 minutes to get there. but if there was a community where no one had a car and everyone rode there bike ir walked. Then there would be no reason to have a car because then all your job oppertunitys would be close by and you would not need to drive to get there. So i really dont see my self ever being able to go and doing somethuing like not using a car.but if thats what people want to do then thats good for them. i want people as a whole to be happy. i think that we can make our own decisions in our life and you know what people should not be judging someone else for there life decisions. its your life live it how you want i really makes me mad when people start getting mad at someone for something they have done because if it has already beeen done they cant go back and change it. it is already done and thats not cool. 
but that doesnt mean that in alls it is 
Those are three reasons why i would talk to multiple different source's and get there advice instead of just talking to only one source and getting a microscopic amount of advice compared to the amount of advice i would get talking to multiple source's. 
If we use the peoples vote we would get more accurate votes and it would be fair for everyone. The Electorlal College is pretty much what the government wants rather than what the people want which is why many citizens have problems with our current president, so if the people could just get a say in who they think should run the country they should. When we vote for a presidential candidate we are actually voting for a slate of electors and not for the president. 
The electoral college is a unbeneficial way of voting because they may be bias towards the people, for example, one might know what another so it can be considered as favoritism. In a sense this voting system can be manipulated in ones favor. How the voting system works is considered wrong to many Americans. 
in the 8th paragraph the author claims, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
In my opinion the U.S. population is not ready for that kind of responsability 
Also, another thing not a lot of people think about that could be good or bad is homework. 
An online class in the peace and quiet of your own home with the things you need to help you focus, things that you cant always have at school will surely benefit this student from an educational stand point and mentally. 
I can honestly say it a cause for people to lose their life because I've been involved. My grandmother was talking on the phone it was a self-hand just to end and answer the phone that lil second caused an accident she hit someone from the back don't never think you have the sense to avoid an accident well you don't.   
A dipute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000, but it's likely than a dispute over the popular vote. 
by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something thats too easy and says, "Hahaha you really thought you could do that, thats to easy your gonna have to do more if you want to do that!" 
I believe that if you get multiple peoples advice 
Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
For the longest time electoral votes have been apart of the process of voting the government pulls certain people side and they cast their own vote of who they think should be president and the rules state that if theirs a tie between to presidents that the person who wins will be based on the electoral votes. Over the years we have had many wise presidents and other times we haven't. 
I will and in from he section it says from television this idea was brought up. If it is from that television is not always right. Especially when it comes to safety. Safety is nouthing to play around with or to toy with. It is a prevention of lot lives and or injeries. 
In addition, electors are United States citizens, and are entitled to their own vote based on the Constitution, while they are allotted their own vote, this gives opportunity for problems to arrise 
This shows my reason of Lukes point of view. You should help others when you have a chance and not just sit and watched. I would have volenteered myself to help others in need. He wanted to see the world and have fun al along to help others. 
Next,lets say that maybe the human being is correct,how could scientists prove that it is what the human being suspects? 
venus a very intresting planet to explore so maybe one day we will be able to visit tis place and search for samples and look for unkown elements. 
you are in the military but wouldn't you risk it to save others . 
When students learning online or video at home, maybe they don't understand what video say and if they have a question, what teachers they will ask ? 
For example, two of my friends see why the choice you're making is right and my other friends can see why it's wrong. I think to myself about how the point of view is different and which one I think can have the best outcome. You'll realize the differences in the outcome and make the best decision 
The Facial Action Coding System would just study your face and tell you how you are. Whoever came up with that software and the emotional expressions came out wrong. Then, people wouldn't trust it anymore. When you smile and your cheek bones raise then that a real smile and a showing all your teeth. 
I always thought personalized learning was helpful. It let students be their own teacher and learn how to find information about a topic efficiently, and students learn better if they are forced to find the answer themselves. So if we make our own projects, we can choose how to learn the material in the best way, shape, or form. 
But that not it! the most advange to this topic is that your helping the envoriment! why you may ask? well like as said in source 3 paragraph 24 " Its a good opportunity to take away lower air pollution" thats some evidence i found because has  Carlos Arturo Plaza was riding his bike thats what he said. So he said bascilly that when you use a car your polluting the environment but when you done use a car then not polluting th environment is a advange 
When the poll is taking place, people should place their votes and have those be shipped off to the Electoral College and have the votes be taken there. 
While scientists believe that Venus was at one point like earth, there are some facts that show that it has the looks of earth in some ways. 
With distance learning, students can be in the comfort of their own homes and decide for themselves when they feel best to engage in a new topic. 
Another reason why school help is that some student many not have the money to own an electronic or many have really bad connection to the internet. 
However, students who design these summer projects can easily be given a description of the required curriculum to guide them while they design their projects. This will allow them to find ways they can incorporate the material into an achievable project. 
Some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively. People have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer. For instance, if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner, the action relies on the answer that the person gives. If they say that they should go to a certain restaurant, it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant. On the other hand, if the person asks multiple people, they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion. The more people that someone asks, the more answers that they will get. Therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of. 
Along with the growing influence of technology in society comes the availability to use it to transform the way in which students are educated. With the use of technology, students could be given the responsibility and freedom to complete classes online rather than having to come into school five times a week. However, not all students have the focus and determination like others to be able to hold themselves accountable for completing their classes at home without a physical instructor. 
it will cause less pollution 
more points of view will be provided 
"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho," says Garvin. The mysterious face turned out to be a butte. Not a Alien artifact. Each pixel in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters. compared to 43 meters per pixel in the Viking 1 photo. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars," said Garvin. 
Venus is closest to earth, and earth has a twin. The differences between mars and venus is that sometimes we are esloser to mars and sometimes we are colser to venus, because venus is sometimes around the corner in space and human are sent to numerous spacecraft. No spacesraft has survived more than a few hours not a single spaceship has touched down on venus's more than three decades. When the spacesship trys to land it can't because venus is almost 97 percent caron dioxide blankets venus and the most challenging is that venus have clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venuss atmosphere. Venus temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahenheit. Not many people has land on venus because how hot the planet is and if they are up thirty plus miles above the surface it's still going to be toasty at around 170 degrees. The most importsntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock gas, or anything elae from a distance. The scientists to see the conduct to thorough mission is to understand venus they need to get close and personal despite the risks. A old technology called mechanical computers the devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and it played an important role in 1940s during the world war 2. It's danger to be on venus it's so hot we won't survived by trying to land on it it's 800 degrees on the planet. Venus might be the second to the sun but mercury is closer to our sun and venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, but merury is closer to the sun. The high pressure and heat vennusian geology and weather presen is like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and the frequent lighting strikes to probes of seeking to the land on its surface. NACA try to challenge them self they been trying to find a way to land on venus and makes sure that the spaceship can land on venus. NASA are still working on a spaceship to land more than a few hours so they can see more things about venus that we don't know about. 
In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated and has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being changed is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It is difficult to say but the Electoral College in general was a mistake.  
As I student myself think that I keep a pretty good grade average and with my other students who are C averages students should also have help keeping a B average. I would love to start a tutoring club to help them, but some students may just be to stubborn to admit they need help then that will lead to the kicking off the team or club. 
Venus hasnt always been bad, or dangerous becase it used to be just like Earth. 
Imagine having to attend school, go to work, be at sport's practice, and do many other activities all in a spam of 24 hours. Well, many students nowadays have extremely busy schedules and have to balance many responsibilities on their shoulders at once. 
advice could take people anywhere even if you dont believe me. But it does. having a good variety of choices is better than having none. Because the good choices could take you to a better future, better education and good career. but having none could take no where. Unless you ask for some advice trust me you wont regret it. we only live once, try to make good life deiscions by letting others give you advice.              
The Alantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and others! You might get seasick, but we have some ginger for you that might help. 
because it has haelped this far with fairness and making sure that all the votes have been counted at least twice. 
There are some students that would enjoy extracurricular activities, and some students that will despise it. Some students might like different activities then the other, but would extracurricular activities really benefit the students lifestyle? 
The electoral college has been made from our founding fathers in the constitution it shows a meaning, a meaning not only to us but also to The United states and in the most part its total strangers who pick these people its a political party 
we all have fights in friendships, 
Okay to end my letter, my con conclustion is that this is my letter to my state seator 
It must be taken into consideration that students would have varying opinions, considering what classes they are taking and/or will be; some may think that an assignment is asking for too much, while others may think it is asking for too little. 
The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen. 
Cars use a lot of gas and make the world polluted. There are communities that have given up their cars and are sticking to walking and riding bikes. There is a town in Germany called Vauban that make you pay $40,000 with your house if you want to have a parking space. Also in this town there are only two places to park and this means that 70% of the population there down own cars and 57% sold their cars to live there. People in this town say that living there with no cars relieves stress.In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.On mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. Their were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more then three people but they make plubic transit free from Monday to Friday.These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they celebrate their third year where cars have been banned with the onmly motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day "The day without cars" in the capital city which has about 7million poeple. They are doing this to pormote other mean of transportation and violators adn fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.In America scientist have found that people 16- to -39 years old are not etting their license. With this drop scientist think that pollution will go down in America. In 2005 the number of miles was at its peak and dropped steadily after that. In April of 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% below the peak and is even with the the amount in 1995 
Many students do sports or are in clubs and if you made it mandatory students would not have time for these activities. 
Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet. 
Especially for the little kids who are to scared to ask questions or even middle or high schooler. 
Through distance learning, students don't have to feel pressured to work as fast as other peers and can learn on their own time. 
Distance learning is also very helpful because some students might not be able to attende schools but with distance learning they wont have to go to a school to learn with other kids they can be in there own space to concentrate. 
Some people think aliens are not real and some people think aliens are real. The Face on Mars changed after different amount of years. We don't know how it changed and we probably will never know. 
It doesn't even make sense to have one person have as much say as their whole state put together. 
The computer might be able to detect the persons emotions by characterlise there facial muscles by the expression movements but the student might be annoyed that it does this all the time and doesnt like it 
But this new technology can be very helpful because what if that student is struggling in their classes and they're too shy to say anything or to get any help. 
If you are taking all of this for people to have it on a computer software then you are no better than hispanics or immagrants taking people jobs because it'll lessen the chance of people even knowing or wanting to become in their life. 
Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over their summer break to promote learning whilst outside of a school setting. However, the schools are debating on whether the projects should be student or teacher designed. 
People may agrue that the electoral college system stops a majority vote. 
I would not want this machine in my life 
There are mainly 5 reasons in why the Electoral College should stay 
So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed 
relationship advice, 
Along with relieving stress, pollution will become less of a problem 
Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. 
Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars. 
just because your friends may no wont to do something that doesn't mean that you don't have to either; and also to say that you cant make people do what they don't won't to do and that comment goes to the principle. 
In this new approach to limit car usuage stores are placed a walk away on a main street,rather than in malls along some distant highway. even in the united states the enviromental protection agency is promoting "car reduced" communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.for example congestion went down in france after five days not being to drive and of intensifiying smog.70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars,and 57 percent  sold a car to move here. most people are happier with the the car usage limit due to that fact that they have too be tense anymore. and the wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.Vauban,home to 5,500 people wihtin a rectangular square mile , is the most advanced experiment in low-car sudan surburban. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year.New suburbs may look more vauban-like,not only in developed countries but also in developing world,vauban,germany residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers,going where few soccer moms or commuting excutives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars .Vauban,completed in 2006,is anexample of a growing trend in europe,the united states and else where to seperate surburban life from auto use,as a component of a movement called "smart planning" 
For example, picking up trash in a local park will help reduce the amount of pollution. Or collecting canned goods would help feed the homeless. 
The excitement was short lived for us because we ended up saying that "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa" so that made it disappointing for us. You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform. 
If all things were possible, do you really think this world would be having these arguments or 'hard choices'. "A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number." Does that mean we should go with the popular votes if it's a tie? Yes, well if it's an even number it happens rarely enough where you don't see it often. "Voters are the people who want to express rather than people who think a single vote will decide." The people eho think one vote will decide more than the other's is wrong because what if that person had expressed their vote and the other choice would've won. 
Finally, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe. The Electoral College shows a wide range of it either being a good or a bad way on voting.                
The Electoral College do has it cons for example, the voters actually vote for a slate of electors and not for the president. 
I infact am not for Electoral College or changing election by popular vote. 
My Principal wants to change that we must have a B average to be in any sport. 
I think we should stick with the Electoral College because you vote for your president, vice president, electors, and where the electors meet all at the same time. 
Another negative aspect of distance learning is the lack of discipline. 
. It they trip might be short comparec to other planets but NASA want to make it as safe as possible. 
The sports activities should be earned by putting forth best effort in your education. If students like sports and extracurricular activities, then they should think more about what they must do to participate in them. students need to think about their options first. Its sort of like cause an effect. If students get lower than a B average then it effects their chances of participating in extracurricular activities. Students must think about the consequences of their own mistakes. Just like many famous people today who act in movies and on television, they also had to work hard. I hard work is put into what you are trying to pursue then it can be accomplished or obtained. You just have to earn it. No one is just given anything in life. Those people earn what they have. 
teachers tend to make assignments very long, hard, time consuming, and usually very boring. 
I say that we use the technology that was created for helping emotional expressions of students in a classroom. 
over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now 
For example, if a student takes a language, like Spanish, teachers can design a project where students must write a story in Spanish based on a given prompt. The project could include requirements that were taught from previous classes with some new concepts added in to see if an individual knows new concepts that will be taught in their future class. This will help teachers understand how they can help a student and where they stand in their learning process. 
because many people ignore law 
First a president should be chosen by the people, seeing our county is a democracy meaning that we elect representatives to rule for us, a popular vote fits the sene a bit more than an electoral vote 
Everyone in the world is able to vote for who they want for president. Then finally when a president is elected most people are angry because the Electoral College picked who they wanted and didnt pay much attention to the communitys vote. Instead of the Electoral College voteing and choosing the president it should be up to the community. After everyone has voted, we should just add up who got the most votes and whoever did should be elected as president. It shouldnt be up to the Electoral College. Just because they are higher then everyone else, they shouldnt just be able to choose who they want for president. 
Distance learning is also beneficial for students who struggle in a school setting because it gives them a chance to attend class without becoming distracted of what's happening around them. 
I think students should that policy 1 because they can bring there phone to school and just use doing there free or when they let them use it . 
What if there is an emergency where his ride breaks down he needs a new ride how would he get home because of policy number 2 a kid got stranded at the school 
we can use the facial action coding system to see there facial expersion to every student in class 
In this article, I've learned alot about what scientists go through and they they busy life is. It was exciting reading about this and exploring something like this.   
In source 3 paragraph 4 says,"Large states get more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does." This means that large states ingulf all of the attention from smaller population states. Later will be a growing concern for the Electoral College. 
quicker and easier to get a final decision, 
the passage did say the electoral college is unfair and outdadated 
The "Face on Mars" was found during a search for a possible landing site for the sister ship of Viking 1,Pictures were taken during the search, a showy likeness of a human face was spotted.An enourmous head close to two miles from end to end, was looking back at the camera.Scientists believed it was just another Martian mesa, common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. But it had unusual shadows that made it look similar to an Egypt Pharaoh.The "Face on Mars" is a huge rock formation, which resembles a human head.Shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and because of this, it caused alot of attention to Mars. People believe that it was an alien monument, but proof showed that it was, just a natural landform. 
if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. 
We're the ones living here we all have a right too. It doesn't matter if we make poor decisions we're only human that's what we do, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a say in it 
So let me tell you why our founding fathers started this in 1769's or something like that but ever since they made this system it's been going on until 2015! 
But what if students donÃÂ´t like any of the activities. 
In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. 
driver safety for the passengers, 
but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded. 
I think that's better because the students already bring in phones and use then during class while the teacher isn't looking or not paying attention. 
Some students have summer jobs or go travel to different location's 
being able to help and support students emotionally. 
Traffic Jam Assistants allows the car to handle driving functions like accelerate,steer,and brake by themselves. It allows the driver to know what they need to do to be in a safe postion. 
it is because of population. 
If teachers design the projects they will know how to grade it, they will know what to put on the project, and there would only be one rubric so everyones project would be graded equally. Teachers should also design the summer projects because summer projects are reallly important, it is the first assignment you get in that class. When your teachers assign you your summer project you get a little taste of what the class and assignments will be like. You also get a little taste of what grading would be like aswell, so you know what to expect in the class. These are the reasons why I feel teachers should make the summer projects instead of the students. 
Honestly, the first thing that pops into my head when I think of community service is a bunch of people on the side on the highway with glowing yellow vests picking up trash. 
Phones are also great for emergencies, whether it's to call your parents about a school bus running late or if it's calling the police for a wanted criminal taking you hostage at the school. 
So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. 
In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. 
I agree with the principal making everyone stay after for a extracurricular activity because I think it would keep you active and healthy, meet new people and friends, and have a lot of fun. There a a big verity of different and fun activities there is probably one just right for you.  
Money. Technology. Opportunity 
Some people just aren't that type of people, while others are. 
Say if someone is in a level 1 class and are struggling in that class because level 1 classes are more difficult than level 2 classes 
As middle school children we could have a donation fund at the front office, asking for just a dollar, and if they don't have a dollar, pennies are good to. Then after, we could take it and donate to any shelter that needs it the most. Another idea is, we could just spend an hour a day making our planet clean by helping pick up trash, plant flowers and trees, etc. There are many different projects that we can take on, all together SCHOOL_NAME would truly stand as "The Best Middle School In The World." 
Aslo if is there a tie in the Electoral College the election would be thrown at the House of Representative and giving the Senate the opportunity to select the president, leading to more complexity for choosing a president. 
many are in the suburb of germany. some are also in Bogota. And many more countrys like the United states. 
It would show them that there is much more than just being a kid and trying to get away with stuff. 
some critics' are misguided in companion with "Driverless Cars Are Coming". 
Attend classes an online more useful on this time; to learn how to use different apps, get learn more option. and it is necessary. 
If this communicating is not done properly or clearly it will be very hard to get work done. When you get a job as an adult clear communication will be mandatory. If you do not communicate properly, someone could end up doing something differently then you intended. In student council, students will learn how to communicate with their peers. By doing this, communication as adults will be much easier. Even in disagreements your communication will be essential. 
They shouldn't really even have it during lunch at all, everything will be a disaster. 
Giving students the freedom to learn about topics that interests them far outweighs the notion of just finishing an assignment. In my high school experience, I tend to remember projects that I was truly interested in, rather than the monotonous ones designed by teachers (that solely get work out of you). Projects are meant to be engaging, so that later down in life you can recall the learning experience. This difference proves that creative work fosters quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, a teacher-designed project inhibits a student's potential to express their creative mindset. By receiving a topic and a guideline on how one should complete a project, a student becomes mentally set on pursuing that one path, disregarding all other options. This mental block of creativity can be harmful to a growing teenager as the advancement of society is dependent on creative thinkers which student-designed projects help create. 
I read all these articles about some states having to vote for the president's electors. They say basically when your voting for a president, your voting for his/hers electors. 
getting an all around better answer, 
I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall 
to where not just one candidate get all votes  like nixon and clinton because both only had 43% of plurality majority in the Electoral College. 
A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the "Face", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa. 
Because imagaine what a catastrophe it would be if we did not have the Electoral College, how would they count the votes 
NASA had sent a 3rd space mission in April 5, 1998 when the space ship had passed over Cydonia the took a picture of the face 
If this incredible machine can help our youth than I think everyone should agree on it. 
Students typically have more spare time during the summer, so a student willing to take on a large-scale project would have the time and energy to do so. For example, many students who compete in science fairs at the high school level often begin experimentation before the start of the school year. Working on a science fair project as a summer project could produce extraordinary results. A student with less academic interests could spend their summer learning a new skill, like how to cook. Either way, students would return to school having had valuable experiences. 
because it helps kids in college figure out how the election goes and for them to vote. 
In swing states the voters are very thoughtful about their canidates because they know that in the their case, that their vote really does count (par 20).  It is good to have voters who are very thoughtful and catious about their vote.  The Electoral Colleges encourages this type of behavior among citizens by giving voters a chance to sway an  election in swing states.  Swing states can impact an election.  They are an example of how the Electoral College, while still not completely democtratic, still gives the people a vote. 
The varying amount of electoral votes for each state depending on its size also allows for a more equal and fair election, due to the less populated states not being able to have more electoral votes then the more populated states. 
To avoid this, as well as a multitude of other issues, summer projects should be designed by the students, 
Today my sister and I created a mess of emissions just getting to school to take this test that is completely worthless. I do not gain from this test, nor do my proctors who have to dilligently coach a hundrded students through a bogus set of instructions for this bogus test 
In conclusion if we could possibly bulid something to survive venus we could find some amazing things like if it ever ahad water and find maybe remains of past forms of life. 
because the electoral college system is unfair. 
You would think that the people, including both sides of the political parties, would have more of a say on whome becomes the president for the next four to eight years. For instance, multiple people and groups such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commence, And the AFL-CIO have said and agreed on, "Abolishing the electoral college!". 
Candidates mostly pay attention to states that have more electoral votes, this causes them to pay more attention to the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones, as already argued, some states get more electoral votes than others. Another reason why this is bad is because most states will not pay attention in the election because they will not make a difference. If popular vote were to be in action, then more people and citizens will pay attention because it will be a more interesting election since more epeople have a say and the candidates will pay attention to all states. Even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones to basically decide the election. 
In my conclusion emotion can be easy to find threw high tech software but we as human can see the person emotions to but the only differents is that we see the main picture and not the littlest one's. 
I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity 
fewer pollutions. 
students will forget and will become stressed out 
Multiple car companies are working on cars that drive themselves. Tesla claimes that they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time by 2016. Also Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.Google has had cars that have been on the road independently since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, so far. Google cars arn't truly independent, they are required to have a person in the car to take the wheel in case of simply pulling in or out of a driveway or complicated traffic issues. 
There are plenty of people who should do it and people who cannot do it. 
If kids walk home and have an emergency, what are they supposed to do? kids should always have their cell phones with them just in case something bad like that happens. 
increases the student-technology relationship, which strengthens learning as a whole. 
There have been multiple times people have claimed they've seen Big Foot they have " videos " , evidence and samples of the hair but scientist have not caught big foot so people can claim there are aliens all day long ; but until the world is able to see one in real life and scientist and everyone can see it ; it doesnt exist . 
Texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well 
maby they will have time in school 
With this being said, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing 
but I also think that changing to the popular vote is also a great idea. 
Online school and video conferences also fail to teach students certain skills that prove to be crucial in the future, in one's career and life. 
Conclude if students get classes from home by online they don't want to pay attention because is more easy they get distract. Also they don't want to learn by online. Students can get fall in environment learning and is hard they learn at home. Also they want to play or use phone and not is good option to students get class at home they get distration and decrease to learning. Also students get frustration in class because they don't understand but if they get classes in online they don't learning too because is more hard they learning from home. 
They should be student designed since they will be more motivated to complete the project. 
Many believe that the "Face On Mars" was created by aliens. I believe it is just a natural landform. People believe that is was created by aliens because it "resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." 
If we have this policy i am going to be happy cause this a change to show our principal that we can do it without her telling us because we are older to know what's right from wrong. 
I believe that we should keep the Electroal, because it makes citizens feel that they are in the system and without it people aren't really voting for who they want 
The picture shows us a part of Mars where the face is just form in that weird way 
Of course, people still weren't satisfied. 
Well Venus is sometimes called a Evening Star. It's so bright that young stargazer would be able to find it. Venus is very hard to get a good look at, it's the second planet from the sun. It's name can be misleading, and the planet is refrred to earth as our " twin" plaents. We haven't been able to send a spacecraft over there yet because of the fact that the stuff we send over there are not able to survive for less than an hour. Scientist's have onle been able to send robots and teven they can't find a safe landing sight.The clouds on Venus very corrosive since they have sulfruic acid in them. The air is also 97 percent carbon dioxide. The planet also has the hostest surface, it's tempurature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric preasure is also 90 times greater than Earth's, but despite the planets dangers it would be a worthy pursuite. For example the planets atmospheric preasure is so strong that it crush a submarine that can go into the deepest part of the ocean.Scientist's are fascinated by the planets Earth-like apperence. They think that long ago there use be a form of life that could have been very much Earth-like. The main reasonfor why astronomer's are so fascinated by Venus is because it looks very much like Earth. For example it has valleies, river bank's, and even mountains. Scientist's are thinking of sending a blimp like aircraft that can fly or hover at least 30 if not higher miles the planet's surface. The tempurature would range around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The best part would be that there is plenty is solar power. 
"This is the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster fact". I Think The Disaster Fact is What Has the Office of the Federal Register questioning the Electoral College. Although, The System Allows For Much Worse. 
A specific muscle is used to make an emotion. For example, the zygomatic major is used to move the lips up to make a smile. The zygomatic major and the risorius is used to force a smile like if you feel awkward, depressed, or upset but doesn't want to show it. So even the program can tell if you are forcing a smile or you are actually happily smiling. 
Now throughout this response i have said/typed what I think is, in a way, best for the school and that is to carry out with the no cell phones in school policy. Because the student might lose his/her cell phone or other electronic device. 
the safety that the car would be capable of. 
In conclusion, many people will argue that online classes prevent productive learning and it is better just to go to school everyday, this can actually slow down certain peoples education and prevent them from moving forward. If you have a medical problem or are unable to go to school everyday due to sports or work, you should still be able to take online classes that can work around your busy schedule and allow you to get an proper education while also doing your everyday tasks. Though there may be some areas in online classes that bring up questions like whether students will be able to get all their work done from home, there are many ways around these problems that schools should be able to figure out, to make their students educations as good as in classrooms. There are too many benefits to online classes to not consider them. Online classes will change the dynamics of education but they will change them for the better. Students should have a right to to decide whether to go to school and focus on their education in a facility that promotes learning, students should also have the option to choose whether to take online classes and focus on other aspects of their life like their career or interests. 
its amazing isn't it all we have to do is take a picture and voala we know what the choice is because if he is being truethfull we can say yes he fits but if he is lying we know that we have to make a better choice that just vote on him right of way . 
Source 3 states, "...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that truth is barely betrayed)... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote." For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person. 
not be able to do our best in school. 
In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even with the dangers on the planet. 
Many homes that house one or more students are normally very busy place. Take an average middle class family, around two parents and three children. At least one parent has work, so they are away for they majority of the day. The other parent must now be the one to shuttle the students to doctors appointments, and cannot leave them home. The parent would have to decide between taking their children to everywhere the parent goes, and distracting the children from education, or leaving them home alone. Either the students would not be able to focus on their work, or the parent would not get anything useful done. Say they had a nanny to watch the children while the parents work. Now the children have to be impossibly restrained to keep themselves from bothering each other. Imagine trying to focus on a physics lecture while trying to stop a young child from coming into your room screaming 
make choosing much easier 
the autoer gives many resons why they would like to see venus such as how it is earths twin 
The author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit 
Now you may have heard of something on Mars that looked like a huge rock formation. You may have thought it was created by aliens 
In case you ever got bored, there was no problem playing games. There were so many to choose from. There was baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. I was so entertained. When we played games the time flew by as if it were a cheetah on the clock. There was usually no way you could have got bored with all the choices you had as entertainment. This is another reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. 
I know that when I play a sport and I love I can't stop thinking about it and eventually my grades will just drop ,it is like I am a Leaf in the fall. Also, It isn't very pleasant going home and showing my parents my report cards if I failed any class. My grades started going up as soon as I had quit softball, trust me it makes a big difference in the grades. 
Driverless cars are a great change for the would. 
The more people, the less bias you risk, so asking only one individual could end up ruining a supposedly unbiased report. Not only is bias a problem to consider when asking individuals, making sure their statements are accurate can be equally if not more important. 
Having election by popular votes for the presidents can make our community's can help people get together and talk about which president is better or which on they think has more potential helping out the society 
personalized guidance from teachers. 
Counterclains suggest that because the election depends on the vote of swing states, voters there are more thoughtful and should be the ones to decide how the election goes (Richard A. Posner, source 3). 
When you might not have classes with a certain friend, it is always a good thing to see them if you have an after school activity with them. The friendship won't fade if you still get to talk to them for even just an hour a day. Sharing what you do after school makes you feel like you are apart of something. I always like sharing my stories about my track meets, practices, and pretty much everything. It's exciting to share stories to your friends instead of saying, "oh, I don't do anything after school." You should be happy about seeing the process you made for the school environment. If you end up in the gardening club or even a Junior Honors Society type club, you help make the front of your schools plants look pretty. People will most likely compliment you daily about how it looks and it'll make you very happy. Don't you want people complimenting your work? Lastly, not being in clubs wont make you happy going to school because you have nothing to look forward too. You could've chose between 100 or more clubs to join, but you didn't so you regret it. 
thats why students should have an extracurricular activies. 
I beleive that we should keep the electoral college. 
doesn't mean that they can't throw in a little extra time for the community. Go to study hall or try to get some of your work done in school, instead of talking. 
Making a charity for the homeless people 
However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive. 
I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. 
Requiring students to join an extra activity at the end of the day will also create unhappiness among students. 
The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect your emotions, 
If you are required to stay after school then you wont have as much time to hang out with your friends. 
Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. The students can focus on their studies. 
The mesa resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. The two mesa's share a similiar height, appearence, and were not alien monuments. 
becasue there is only drownes that could go so that they can pick up rocks"safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on good "conditions becasue most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense almosphere " even though we are able to have drownes go there we wont be able to bring any of them back with rocks or some air from that planet. The other reson for them would be that they would have to send real people to go and get some samples but that would be to dangerus 
Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting. 
Allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,Students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences.    
You get to take care of and look after all the animals on the boat. feeding and looking after animals is a great to do with a friend.even if you dont like animals. 
During this paragraph the author would talk about how Venus is like earth well the closest to like being earth. For exaple they even called it its twin and talked about how Venus was once filled with ocean. "Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth." 
By putting people under pressure with a whole state on their back people would choose who ever their state wants. 
Let me tell you the things that would change of limiting car usage. 
Astronomers believe humans could survive there, however it wouldn't be easy with the conditions it has. A beam of light can barely pass throught the atmosphere; this causes the standard cameras to be ineffective. 
I don't think this would be helpful in a classroom because it would just be a waste 
Although you are considering the policy to chance, keeping the policy to allow any student participate in sports and other activities will permit them with chances of a better, well-rounded future. Think of the students futures above what they learn today and may not excel in. 
student-design actually can benefit the students more 
When assigning work to students over break, teachers normally would base the work and projects on how much time we have. 
body: so me personally think this would be some great technology to have in our schools 
If you look closley at the 1976 picture its a low quality picture since its from 1976 than twenty-three years later in 1998 it was taken again lots of people who had seen it were not sastisfed it was a winter april in 1998 it was also a cloudy time of year on Mars. Even though the cameras took the picture ten times sharper it had been really cloudy so you could barley see the picture to have real proof if it was created by aliens. Later in 2001 they had gave it a other shot making it the most recent. The 2001 picture had still been some what the same as the 1976 picture 
Now some people might say that it's "too hard","I just dont need it" , or " it takes too much time". 
one person could know more about the situation 
Since it is students who do the projects, why not let them decide what those projects should be? 
I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. 
I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. 
A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on our own planet 
Possibly helping an elderly person across a street or picking dropped things up for people. Community service should be a requirement to always help out whenever available to do so or when the student knows that they are capable of doing a larger task 
The education system is designed around the process of preparing children for successful living in society, whether that is pursuing higher education or entering the working world. In reality, students are unlikely to actually use most of the information taught to them during primary education, so school is a method of building skills that can be used for life rather than facts and ideas that are actually necessary. 
The electoral college is unfair to votes because the winner take all system in each state 
so if they ever needed them they would call them and they would answer right away. 
more people now a days just have completely stop caring about the enviornment. 
Having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched. Schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel. Some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom. 
I have a question. When citizens vote in electoral college why do their votes go straight to the candidates and not the president? 
The Electoral College is the method that we should keep.    
No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school. 
For example, the recent pandemic-level outbreak of the novel coronavirus in America has led to the closure of all public schools in Seattle, Washington. By ensuring that children and adolescents can obtain a proper education online and from the comfort of their home environment, fewer people as a whole get sick and fewer carriers can actively spread a given malady. In addition to the aforementioned benefits of online public education, accessibility to immunocompromised and/or older teachers & immunocompromised students opens up significantly and such individuals can obtain a quality education with mitigated risk. 
students shouldn't be forced to do an extra curricular activity 
Secondly, there isn't actual proof that aliens created it anyways. 
Work is a concept that no student enjoys.If students were to create their own summer assignment, they would spend even more time thinking about what they would want to do rather than actually fulfilling the needed criteria.If a Junior in High School is assigned a summer assignment in which they have full control, they would need to create a meaningful and efficient piece of work that would assist them in maintaining and learning the information needed for the class.Assuming that the student has a rigorous summer schedule, where would they have the time to effectively plan and carry out a summer assignment in which they can comprehend the information necessary for the class? 
Getting to school everyday may not be possible to many students based on their circumstances. To others, their mental health might put them in a position where they are not able to reach their full potential at school, causing their grades to suffer. Whatever the reason may be, taking classes online is a convenient way of being present in school while also meeting the needs of those who need it. 
Well i think it can and should be brought to teachers and schools to really crack doown on well, reckless teenagers. 
so im saying with the entire school on my side lets try cell phones just for times like lunch or even a couple days out of the week. 
After considering both sides of this controversial claim, I believe the author did not support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. 
We perform these same impressice calulations everday 
Students can ncreased to learn at home. Also is more hard to students understand by online. Also many students have hard time in class to understand that teacher explain in more hard they learn at home. 
When you attempt to find love there are dangers. The one you have chosen may have a history of being unfit to hold a relationship, or just has a bad makeup due to their past and they don't feel like changing now. Venus is just like the signifacant other you are looking for. Whilst it is a planet, it has numours dangers like it's chemical makeup, temperature,etc. 
Also, traffic jams may be problematic; but for some people, the overpopulation of many people being crammed up into your personal space in the outside air may be a real pain. 
Seeking multiple opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions 
If you are planing for college the guidance will help you by getting scholarship from college or sports team.Also, for students who like to play sports will have the chance to play sports with school team, and will help them by getting a scholarship. 
Lastly, student designed assignments would test the capabilities of the student more accurately. 
reduces bullying 
The state senator should consider changing election to popular vote for the president of the united states 
it would take years to discover anything beneficial 
Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage.The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a "winner-take -all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat. 
I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service 
One last reason was known as "Swing States". 
To conclude all of the reasonings of arguing to change election to popular vote for the president of the U.S which are the sensation of unification, direction, and freedom, I'd be obliged to state that this is just one thing that finally unifies and brings the U.S's people together. Those three senses that this gives us is a seemingly small, yet great difference. And even though most don't realize it, it's definitely there.    
I believe them are advantages of limiting a car.                    
Every summer students are required to complete a project to ensure learning is being accomplished. Some say that these projects should be teacher-designed others say they should be student-designed. A high school student once stated that " a project over the summer sounds boring ". Others must think how can one make a project during summer fun if its teacher-designed? 
There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. 
Making a choice on impulse will rarely turn out well as you probably have very little knowledge and advice from others going behind it. It is when you step back and get advice from others that you prevent yourself from making these kinds of decisions. As an example, think about leaders in government. Often times they take a long time to make a decision as they hear from all of their advisers and take their time, as they do not want to make a impulsive choice. By forcing yourself to slow down and get advice form others, you are making better choices by having other's advice and making yourself think a little harder about what choice you are going to make. Getting advice does more than just slowing you down to make a better choice, it also allows others to make sure you are making one that will have serious consequences. 
Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. 
that there was no sign of them when we went to Mars. 
they have family 
The Electoral College method is basically electors that elect the president and not the people which I think is completely useless. 
Another benefit for students from distance learning is the ability for mentally ill students unable to attend school due to disorders such as social anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and depression to continue learning outside of an environment detrimental to their mental health. 
students would do subjects that they are interested in resulting in more projects being completed 
In the Electoral College they avoid the problems of the elections which no canidate recevies a majority of the votes cast 
There is absolutely no fun in getting in a car and not driving around and just waiting for something to happen so it could be your turn to drive just like it asks on paragraph 8. It would become pointless to go through all that process of getting your permit and license if you are not driving the vehicle. It would be hard to interpret driving fun in new way with driverless cars. 
In Conclusion i think the idea is stupid ion think you should do it yall just letting tecnolgy take all the way over i feel yall shoukd just let people be if somebody want someone to they moody they will tell them maybe talking about it make them madder then what they is you never know thsts why its important to mind your bussins 
I think that even if students don't want to participate in these activities, they should because they can learn things that they never knew before, and I think that it could make an impact on their lives. 
For example you have to work 11:30 A.M. through 8:30 P.M. Then you can schedule a class for 10:00 P.M. You can pick your time of the day class. Different from being in a real school, you have to be at that class at a certain time and day, or you're marked absent or tardy. 
Should you be able to text and drive? 
If they are trained to study hard and play sports at the same time, it will pay off because they will have to get organized and pay attention to time management. 
If a car could go forward on its own, but can't drive under certain conditions, how is it really a driverless car? If a person in the car were to fall asleep while being drove by the car, then there were to be an accident that the car couldn't handle, how would the car alert the person it was time to drive. There is a big reason as to why people dont hop out of bed and into a car. The brain needs time to adjust and wake up before attempting a process that can quite legitimately kill people. A single car accident can kill many people. Pretending that driverless cars are a toy isn't an option. People with health problems wouldn't find a driverless cars helpful either. Awareness of people who cant feel vibrations, cannot hear, and cannot see, would all be in danger riding in this type of car. Without being in control of the wheel and acceleration at all times reduces the feeling of needing to be alert in the car, causing more careless accidents that could have been avoided if the car had an alert and ready driver. 
According to an NPR article on multitasking, when you are "Switching from task to task, you think you're actually paying attention to everything around you at the same time. But you're actually not 
Though the electoral college is an anachronism it is not democratic in a modern sense because the electors are the ones who choose the president not us the people though each party has to select of slate of electors who are intrusted to vote for the party's nominee. 
it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay-out. How-ever I do not agree with them 
Though there are also some retiries that do not care at all about any of this mumbo jumbo and would rather just relax in the sun. Though if there wasn't election based on popularity then the elders would not have the benefits they would like such as more retirement funds, or better health care benefits. 
if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher's already limited teaching time. 
It will be very beneficial for some students to attend classes from home because some of them prefer working independently. 
I think they should go by popular vote 
Second if you want the kids to really feel something and want to make sure they feel it then you'll know. 
In addition if you want to go to your friend's house and you need your parents to sign a slip to let you go on your friends bus, they can just bring it to school.When you are not feeling well and you feel the need to go home, you call your parents to let them know you are not feeling that well. 
representatives in states 
I think that students should be given the opportunity to obtain distance learning 
The disaster factor is the risk that the electors could always defy the will of the people. 
It is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want; 
first the more people who vote its easier to determine who would become president 
Many students in my school district need to be driven to their nearest bus stop to even be able to ride for an hour to attend their local high school. Inclement weather or lack of a ride forces many of my school mates to miss class. These absences can be counteracted with the introduction of online classes. Students will benefit from online courses and curriculum without having to worry about having their transportation needs met. Students will be able to participate in an online classroom and engage with others without having to step out of their own home. Weather or lack of a ride forces many bright students to miss out on critical learning opportunities because of circumstantial needs. These aforementioned situations are common around the country and the introduction of online classes will alleviate these unfortunate absences.Many schools outside of the country don't provide transportation services similar to the US. Students in Germany take the metro to get to school and many other students are forced to ride trains or local buses to their high schools. This may cause many students to feel unsafe and administer a feeling of fear with going to school. In many cases, girls feel unsafe to ride local buses and trains alone due to fear of sexual assault or kidnap. Rape and sexual assault are horrid things to think about but are often times reality for many females (and males) on public transportation. Online schooling offers a way for students to take classes online without having to worry about these issues. It gives students a chance to learn without worrying about their safety and the safety of others. 
Keeping the Electoral College would greatly benifit our country.  The electoral process is a very important process that is needed. 
I argue this because with the Electoral College we get to vote for who we believe is gonna help us out during thier years as President not the choice of the president who we might not believe or trust in anymore to vote for us or the other side. 
I think that the principal should not decided that every single gosh darn student should do an extracurricular activity. 
whats the point in voting if our vote may not even count?In the Electoral college people citizens vote for a slate of electors who then later go and vote for president. However, sometimes it doesnt work that way. The electors are not obligated to choose the president that the people want. 
The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. 
dont want you knowing all about their life. 
My overall reason is that it is not done professionaly like it should be. The same people should be running for president again especially the one who won before because he has another shot at winning again. That means that they change to many things. Like the school food and drinks the food is now healthy and the drinks are diet some kids and teachers have to have sugar or they will not do so good through out the day like if the have diebetes they might need some sugar well they wont get it because all the food is healthy and the drinks are diet now.Those are the reasons why i dissagree.           
The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established in the constition. The electoral college consits of 538 electors and a majority of 278 votes. 
you can help us bath animals 
some people may think Community Service takes to much time up for then 
Sometimes people need advice choosing between two solutions for their problems. If someone can't decide which is the better solution for their problem, asking multiple people can help. 
if they are not doing work they are goofing around in the classroom then yes they shouldn't be aloud, but if they are not goofing around and they are doing their work they just need some more help then they should be able to participate is these extra choricial activities. 
But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones. And if there was a statues then why is it only it's head you would a lest find the other parts of the statue but we haven't and that's because it only a land form shaped into something almost everyone beleives to be actuale life. 
Yes,the use of this techology is valuable beacuse maybe what you'er are upset and there is no one there to make you feel better. 
tudents will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. 
First, this solution addresses the wants of the first group. 
It is great if people want to do it but like i said before, not everyone wants to or they just cannot have the time to help out. 
If a student were not able to identify their emotions when seeing a therapist or school counsoler, then this device would work best their specifically because therapists/counsolers are trained to help with humans and their emotions. 
One example ''republicans in california. knowing their vote will have no effect , they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigh than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.... but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did nvote in (2012)election''. In electoral consist in vote that person going is necessary much candidate for fine electoral college " the electoral college consts of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president." 
If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly. 
They should be student designed since that is their break from school and during their break, they can do whatever they please to do with their time. 
"I don't like the sea air", "I hate the ocean", " I can't swim", "What we get tropedoed? I can't swim", I have allergies to horses". These are exuses I get when I try to convince other people to join the progam I am in. I did convince some, but not a lot. Most think that I am a creep. They try to get away from me. I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried. Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join. Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now. When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys. They always say the same thing. "I wish I joined the program." Then we have a good talk about what they did while I was overseas. I feel like that I have more friends than I used to before. 
but I believe that long distance classes would not benefit the student's learning. 
With this kind of technology, it could help the teacher plan their lesson so the students can understand, but they don't get bored 
Voters don't get to choose the electors. Some electors might even defy the wishes of the people who voted for them. There are 538 electoral votes, which is an even number so their could be a tie. 
Either way it goes we have to earn the privilege to use and bring our cell phones to school. 
Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest. 
Why shouldn't they be allowed you ask? Well there are many reasons why they shouldn't be allowed, so let me tell you more. 
Also in the electoral collage theirs been many mistakes. 
Clearly, they are incorrect because student-based summer projects allow students to move at a pace that is appropriate for them and give students incentives to work harder. 
Sometimes, somethings are better left unexplored because it could have risks that people don't even know of. 
Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic. 
A lot of people would lose their job if we got rid of them. You think the unemployment rait is bad now get rid of cars and watch it increase. 
As technology advances, this programming should be required for school systems to partake in and offer to their students who would like to take their education by the horns and steer it in the right direction. 
All you have to do is feed them, clean them, and clean there stalls. It is not a hard job, 
This would mean you would have a large variety of choices to pick from. 
See with the popular vote they go straight to the president and not a scam like eletoral vote. It's more confidental if your really serious about your president. Now what if the wrong president get picked? Then what? High bills,going up on gas,harder to get hired.         
Generic_City's lifeguard program was very successful during the summer due to lifeguard availability. Being a lifeguard is a common job students pursue during the summer. Not only does it allow students to gain profit at a young age, but it also requires a high level of maturity and responsibility. Because it requires specific training and dedication, students must have the time to complete every task that is given. Having a student-designed summer project allows students to set their own study time instead of following a specific schedule that could intervene with working hours.In 2019, the Pied-Piper Theater Association successfully rehearsed their summer musical: West Side Story The Musical, due to the availability and hard work of all actors. In West Side Story, the combination of performing arts and music are combined as one to produce an extraordinary musical. Rehearsing a musical is no simple task: lines must be memorized, choreography and blocking must be pristine, and every actor must be present on opening show days. A student-designed project over the summer can help students complete their required work in an flexible manner while still completing personal activities. 
Venus has the closest density, size and occasionally the cloest planet in distance too. This planet is the second planext from the Earth. All the planets orbit the sun at different speeds, and sometimes Eath is closer to Mars and other times it is closer to Venus. Venus is called the "Evening star" 
say (Bradford Plumer) and sometimes people wonder what would might cause the disaster factor We sholud consider our selves lucky  that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest electon crisis in a century  sya (Bradford Plumer). 
they can also use there cars less 
Lastly it would be beneficial to NASA for them to say its aliens 
There is also the point countered Mr. Posner's article, which is that those in party-dominated states will have a feeling their vote doesn't count, and he sais that one vote will not swing an election. 
Some kids never wanna get up and come to school so they end up skipping school. 
I get that home school is fun but it isnt always the best choice. Online classes may sound so cool, you can just stay in your pajamas all day long and do your work 
Pretty much anywhere you go whether it's school or work, you will hear that as an American Citizen, you have the right to vote. If you don't vote for the president of your choice, you can't complain when things go wrong 
The reason I think there isn't anything wrong with this is because I dont see its harming anything. 
On April 5,1998 Eightteen years after the Viking 1 and 2 were shut down the Mars Orbiter Camera came into orbit range of Mars and started taking pictures. The team of scientists espiecially focused on getting a picture of the face so they could reveal to public that there was indeed no face on Mars. 
"Researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." We wouldn't be able to see it far away. We would need to see it close up so we would be able to study and explore it. 
The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of a qualified citizens. Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. You help choose your state electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. 
we will need phones wich reach a good signal. 
Less car usage will help the enviroment as well as lower stress. "Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons." (Source 4). By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life. 
Some might say that distance learning does not help students who are unable to go to school, 
While it may make getting places harder 
Some skeptics also say that the alien markigs were hidden by haze. On April of 1998 when the skeptics say their ideas it was cloudy at that time and on Mars it was winter. 
students would lose the option of extracurricular activities and to socialize with other students. 
Summer projects should be a way for students to get used to the type of work they will be doing with a certain teacher in the future 
The final bell on the last day of school is a sound that is rejoiced by students and teachers alike. This bell is the signal to the beginning of summer break. While this break is usually filled with vacations, sporting events, and sleeping late, there is another key element that represents summer break for many students: the project. This project is incorporated into the summer break to assure that students continue learning. In many schools, this project is teacher-designed, resulting in uninterested and procrastinating students. In addition, many teacher-designed projects do not foster creativity. 
The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. 
but it is not as good a trade, cell phones, and better grades. 
I am against technology being able to read students emotional expressions. We shouldn´t have computers telling exacly how our students are feeling. 
In source two, Bradford Plumer said that "under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said "they can be anyone not holding public office" and "electors could always defy the will of the people". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said "when you vote for your canadidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector's". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate. 
In recent weeks, news of new, life threatening viruses (such as the Corona virus) has gone up at a rapid rate, causing a large amount of disarray and discomfort within the educational system; between the staff members, the students, and the parents, it seems inevitable that schools will close to keep the students and the staff members as safe as possible. Once they understood the circumstances, parents and students started to have questions; "how will the students continue getting their education?", "what format will it be in?", and "how will it be administered?" The response that most school counties developed for these questions was long distance learning. Distance learning is a new format of teaching where students stay at their homes while completing assignments; but, this method of learning has gotten somewhat controversial. Many teachers argue that distance learning is not effective and that it allows for students to copy, cheat, or flat out be lazy. This is a true judgment, but misled; 
People with a b average should be able to play sports because they do they school work, they do there homework, and they keep there grades up. People with a c average should be able to play they do there work but they can do better to improve there work. Students who have a c or above average should play sports. The students with a b average can help kids keep there grade so the other kids can play sport too. 
I am writing to you to argue in favor of changing the Electoral vote to election by popular vote for the president of the United States 
Overall, one's health plays a huge role in one's schooling and place of schooling. 
if its not your thing your not going to want to do it and your not going to have fun doing it 
I think online classes would not benefit students 
Its something thats really cool alot of people and little kids would like it. 
if you don't like that pacific class or if your not good at that subject. 
maybe people need exercise and cant get it at home because they cant. 
We can learn from their mistake or build off their previous choice. Again, the only way to learn these stories is to ask more than one person for advice. People that base their advice from what they have experienced normally have a good reason for a certain solution. People do have different experiences, though. This is important to know so that we can see the differences and similarities of their past. Their opinion might strengthen your own and give a reason to choose a different option. 
This face has shodows and yes it does make it look like it has eyes, nose, and mouth, but that just really what we want to see if you were told it was a face you would've beleived it. 
While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, "residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..." (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests. 
At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Becasue of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. 
In retrospect, this is what a good deed would look like if the students were to perform in the environment. It would be a good idea because it would teach the students not to be selfish, be better people, and it would benefit the whole community at that. I personally think it's a great idea to have the students be required to perform in the community. How about you? what do you think we should do? 
If not then i dont know what to say, because im pretty sure in one of the amendmendments it states thats "every human being will be treated equal no matter what. 
With all the risk it may not be possible to explore Venus but if you are determined to find the answers then it could be possible. 
In my experience not all the projects I have gotten have all the guidelines. This leaves me stuck. The guidelines help me determine what material I need to research and how much of it. Sometimes it might even be that I dont know what kind of product I am making to convey that said research. This not only provides lack of a acceptable project but also not giving good guidelines gives unwanted stress towards the student. For example some students I know worry that their project is not good enough to meet the expectations of the teacher, or that they are not doing the work that is wanted. Giving guidelines will provide less stress for the student and with that a better outcome with their project. 
Schools were intended to bring students together, allowing communication with one another, which is why it is so important for students to learn in grow in schools that are not online. 
It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face. If you look furter into the artical it says that everytime they went across the planet that it looked exactly the same. 
, students may have other summer actives such as Generic_School sports or camps 
How useful would they be? 
public transportation, 
I believe that these projects should be designed by teachers 
If we call it summer break then the students shouldn't get any summer projects thats gonna ruin the break for them. Let them enjoy their summer break 
Community Service can help animals from going extinct 
Its pretty amazing what they can do with technology these days so we might as well adjust to it instead of push it away.That is why we should be able to have technology like this.            
For me community service is a good way to show kids how to work. 
The landform is Martian mesa formation much like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. 
Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break.Some may point out that since the students are the ones taking time out of their break to complete these assignments, they should be the ones designing them.Others may argue that the teachers should design these projects. 
Another example will be if you are out of town and you still need to get work your done , the perfect way will be doing it online 
in the class you dont have partners or others people with you, 
Some teenager are better to work by their self to get it all done. 
Venus is 'Earth's twin", yet is a challenging planet for humans to study. Why? The thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus, with a tempature over 800 degrees Farenheit and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than what we could or would ever expirence here on Earth. Not to mention the erupting volcanoes, powerful earhtquakes, frequent lightning, with the hottest tempature of any other planet; traveling would be indisputable. Venus at one point was "Eath like", the planet still has familiar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. 
it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go 
more flexibility in your schedule, 
My claim would have to be that I would wan this in my class or around my school beacuse i personaly feel like many students will come into school with a diffrent mood if they knew there expresions or feelings are all being detected 
The companies that make the driverless cars, or the driver, it is yet to be determined who would be at fault. The company for making flawed technology, or the driver for being in the car. "Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturere?" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 9). This will be a huge issue if driverless cars do become legal. Driverless cars could effect the people in more way than one. 
Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a "Certificate of Ascertainment" witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.    
In one of they many paragraphs I had read, it simply stated "The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be (overruled)" 
Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus. 
The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguements for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right 
you will learn things, know things, and see things that are new to you. You would also be very amuzed by half of the things you see, such as long ago history buildings, and even musumes. This event that you will take, will open the world up to you. It will show you how other people do things, and how they get treated. 
in my opinion i think we should change the election by popular votes instead of ellectoral college, because we the people .. vote for who we think should be head or our state and who we think is going to be in charge and do they thiing and make our a state a better and safier place to live. 
Have you ever had to do a summer project? 
In this story the author is talking about Venus. Alot of people could care less about the planets but its a big part of the world today. In this story its talking about Venus and everything people need too know about it 
You should join it because you get to help others and animals. Also it not just a plus for them it is one for you too. 
Driverless cars, should be as the title states, cars that are driverless. These cars, will give you warnings when it is going to need you to take control again. The author states, "In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when theroad ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." If these cars were really driverless, they wouldn't need a driver to help them navigate. Are these cars really driverless? No. 
As a conclusion, summer projects have to be teacher-designed. It must be designed by teachers, so students can learn efficiently and effectively. Also, it can help the teacher understand and get to know the student through their summer project.  
Three years later, NASA proved our skeptical theorists wrong again. 
It is my belief that our community could use community service 
with its rocky terrain and with that Astronmers are fascinated. "If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its sureface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system 
driving the handicap 
Finaly, there is technology being made that reads someones emotion. The technology even know's when it is a lie. 
By the way the article talks about how a "home PC can't handle the complex algorithms" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. 
but for some people it just takes to much time! 
electoral votes are basically a summary of the states vote . People vote for a slate of electors to represent their state in the election . Voters will vote for a representative to choose who becomes president on electoral votes 
There could be life under the ground but we wouldn't know that cause we cant even get to the surface of the plant. If there is life on the plant we could learn how they world by watching. Maybe even with pictures. With oceans we could find if there are organisms in it. It would prove that there is a different kind of life on the planet. 
for all these reasons i thinki they shoudnt take down the college, because where would the votes from the electors go. 
Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen. 
The people only influence the electoral college. 
It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe. 
so that these projects for students can stay related to school related topics to fully ensure that students are still learning while on summer break 
In conclusion, facial recognition is a great way to get students on the right track in school. It can help the teachers decide if their teacher techniques are effective or not. 
Although, others believe that distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is not beneficial. Others believe that distance learning wouldn't be beneficial for students because the youth is too irresponsible of holding themselves accountable for having such a tremendous responsibility. 
they will think to themselves wow i really did help make a difference in my community. They will often take pride in their work. We should help our communities. 
Having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic. Then, children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss, plus they'll be able to work together on the topic. If the topic they made friends over was a sport, they can become better friends because teammates have to rely on each other during games. Having a sport as an extracurricular activity also gets kids exercising and it's not always a bad thing. 
You might just want to try something new. You might think that something is boring but then you end up liking it. 
Many student's do not have opportunity to be part of one school. The school, or the study, are the most important thing for the future, because everyone depend of money, everybody need study to get a good job and make money. Each one know what want be in the future, so that is exactly whatever some need to study. Each person have those own personal problem's, therefore, not everybody have the opportunity to study in a school 
You can recognize by looking at them but only 1 or 2. with this new system you can find them all. 
Summer is what what every student look forwards to once they're in school, everyone who has been a student knows this. Summer projects can be fun and it's a great way to help students from forgetting the information they learned in school. Having fun and getting some freedom is what makes summer so special to so many students all over the world. Completing assignments is what school is all about, some can be fun and some are confusing and downright boring. Students do not get to make many decisions with their schoolwork. 
Allowing students to design their own summer projects is a more fair way to assign work over the summer holiday. 
Also when riding in or driving a motorized vehicle, your could get into an accident.  Getting into an accident in a vehicle could have much more fatal result than you walking, jogging, or even riding a bicycle. 
not everyone get's to vote for an electon. 
Driving can be learned at the age of 16 in most countries. Some people can learn at different age groups by their parents or they can go to a driving school. 
As Source 1 states, this proportional representation is only done by Maine and Nebraska, but it makes it so that one party wont win the state, it is reigional in the state meaning that more people are represented through this. The winner take all system is too harsh, and can discount many people in swing and regular states. As Source 3 stated, the larger states need to be left alone to represent the US population. Proportional representation allows this with the ability to include even more opinions. With this informatin, it is easy to see how proportional representation will preserve the equality that popular vote represents. 
Also, it was established as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
Using software such as the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom setting as it could improve the quality of learning for students. 
When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict within the household dynamic. 
There are a total of 5 reasons why we have to keep this method to choosing the president 
Venus is a complicated planet, with many features that are not imaginable. Although we haven't made many big discoveries about Venus itself, we will still continue to learn, look at, and love everything about it. 
As students grow older, they will be assigned an appropriate amount of responsibilities, such as schoolwork and projects; even some that are meant to be completed by the first day of school. Summer project can be intimidating to some students, however, summer projects are only meant to benefit the students. The benefits of summer projects include: the continuation of study and time management skills, as well as reading and writing. There is a simple solution that could be put in effect by the school officials and administration; allowing students to design their own projects based off a topic that peaks their interest. Allowing students to design their own projects will significantly increase the interest level and positive feedback that will be the deciding factor in whether or not the project is assigned the next year. The interest level and feedback received will be based off of the following: if students are given the opportunity to conduct research that they find intriguing, not what their teacher finds intriguing; their final project will be significantly better than if the project was teacher-designed. 
If teachers designed the summer projects they would have more indepth questions and work to do that would get students brains thinking and learning. Teacher also know all of the critearia that has to be followed. Teachers are able to make projects fun and enjoyable as well as give the students a little stuggle with the work so they would actually be learning instead of just flying right through the project. 
Another explanation of why attending school from home would not be beneficial is because there is no personal connections with teachers 
For example, I volunteer for community service at a place called PET. This stands for Personal Energy Transportation. It is an amazing thing to do. You build all-terrain wheel chairs for handicapped people all over the world, but mostly in third world countries. The wheel chairs have three wheels and are designed to go through deep sand, over sharp rocks, and up and down steep inclines. In this workshop, it teaches teamwork, and makes you more mechanically minded. It is also a very courageous, bold, selfless thing to do and it will really change someone's life. Another example is that people sometimes down want to do certain activities because their boring. With required community service that will have to do things that they normally wouldn't do. By doing these things they build character and self esteem. This will help them in the future with doing homework, getting into a good college, and even with wanting to do community service again. This is why our principal should require community service. 
I don't think we are advanced enough yet where we can take on something this big. I belive we are not ready to take this big of a leap from comeplete control to a car driving all on its own. I think they should start by selling cars that they know people can trust and they can even start small and work they're way up to cars driving all on there own, but for now I don't think that we are advanced enough for them. 
They say Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Its a crucial consideration given the long time frames of spave travel. The value of returnung to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive. 
they will appreciate it more, 
To begin, a lot of students work on weekend also some students work after school too. For example, most of students are working forty five hours in a week. This shows that more students can get tried so they do not like to go school. They just like to focus on their education by an online 
According to the article, they're five good reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. "1) certainty of outcome, 2)eveyone's President, 3)Swing states, 4)Big states, 5) avoid Run-Off Elections. 
I think if the votes are close then everybody should vote again not just one person outta ten people the state has to choose. Also it is not done professionaly like it is supposed to be. Some people deserve a shot at it but no you guys think that the presidents from the last election should be put back in well no because that same guy who won it last year has the chance to win it again and its not fair if he wins it again. 
3 reasons why the electorial college should not be used because you vote for a slate of electors 
WE should be able to keep the loft because it has a definite outcome when our president is elected 
I wouldn't want someone I had no say in do that. because the person you voted for you obvioulsy had a reason to vote for them, in my persepctive of this, other people will catch on and find the good in the best one. The guy with the most votes wins. 
i know that i am very highly over them in academics and especially all sports. I bet i will go to a d1 university hopefully at NOTRE DAME for a starting wide receiver or cornerback position. In order to go to that prestigious d1 university you have to have a 4.2 gpa and a hell of a top football player in the country. 
the text states,"Luke also toured an excavated castle in crete and marveled at the panama canal on his way to china." 
because as soon as most people found out there was a black president running they were against it the thought it was the worst idea ever. Instead of giving Mr. Obama the chance he deserved most people were against him. So if it wasn't for the Electoral College Mr. Barck Obama wouldn't have gotten the chance he deserved. Romeney also could've won but that's not the way Electoral College works when voting you are actually voting for a slate of electors and they chose the president. 
It is also much wiser to help someone in need rather than students at home playing video games or watching television. 
Accidents always happen. 
Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature. 
to clean up the school would help then people would do it but if it involves cleaning then some people will say yes and some no. 
Students that get home schooled dont get the most out of there teaching its more distractions and plenty other stuff that throw them off track. I dont think schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. 
This is why i think the Electoral College should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.                                                                                    
From things like pep rallies, high school football games, and dances, online learners will not be able to participate in these things when learning from home. Without this constant lack of communication students get at school, these online learners will also not have the experience to make as many friends. 
Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of "The Challenge Exploring Venus," explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to "intimidating endeavors." 
it would also look good on your reputation. 
Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people. 
If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local enviroment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases. 
Scientifics explain that Venus has the hottes surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. 
One day I was playing basketball and this guy got mad because i blocked his shot. After I blocked his shot he wanted to fight me. So he came after me, he laid a punch on my chest. It hurt pretty bad. I wanted to fight him and punch him back so badly because I wanted to stick up for myself. Then, my friends who we were playing with said,"Don't punch back it is not the right thing to do," so i didint punch back and I walked away and went home. I was OK, but I had a big bruise on my chest. That is an example of how multiple opinions from others can help you make better decisions. If I would have not walked away, we would have got into a big fight. So, I am glad that I walked away. My parents were very happy as well. Always make the right decision and the good choice not the bad choice. 
I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from "Driverless Cars Are Coming: 
Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport. 
All of these inconveniences could be easily avoided if students could complete their work from home. Colleges offer online classes for students that are unable to be on campus or students that need flexible schedules. Schools could resemble the same structure college classes have to better adjust to the students. 
In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging place to see and be. Venus has not been touched in more than 30 years! In the text it says ".. not a singlr spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." So although Venus is the sister of Earth astronomers know very little about her. So they keep in pursuit to learn more despite the dangers it presents everytime. 
Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! 
Driverless cars are in the making. Google has already made a few cars that are some what driverless. Companies are on the uprising of completeing their first driverless car. The cars they're making out to seem driverless are not actually driverless, but they're in the making. The technology is close enough. Electrical cars are coming, and you won't want to miss it. 
when someone get injured and where is his back up oh wait he's not here because he is studying at home and he has a C average in he math class 
and we can kind of learn what we want to do when we're older. 
When you return from the trip overseas you will never forget about it because you will want to tell the whole world about how much fun you had. When you tell the people how much fun you had hey will want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Also on the trip back home you unload all the animals you can play volleyball games and other games that will help pass the time. Also you will always remember the trip of a lifetime 
Taking classes at one's home would distract students physically and mentally, making it difficult for them to be totally immersed and invested in what they are learning. Even if it is unintentional, a student will rush through their coursework in order to move on to something else more interesting; like playing basketball, watching a movie, or even just eating lunch. In a traditional school setting, class schedules keep students and teachers alike focused on the task at hand. Similarly, it gives them a clear time to take much needed breaks. An environment dedicated to learning lets students know that, when they come to school, it is time to learn. This separation of work and play is much more productive than working at home. So much happens at home. People eat, sleep, hang out with friends and family, cuddle with pets, have good conversations and bad conversations; the list goes on and on. Trying to do work in an such a busy and dynamic environment makes it hard for a learner to dial their brain into the current task at hand. A school environment dedicated to learning makes it easier for a students brain to focus and function. 
"I say we change!" Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States can be a way better idea to do than keeping the Electoral college. 
When students do community service voluntarily they usually feel proud of themselves after they are done 
Many principal many get many complaints about their students having their phones in school I believe they cant do any thing about it, if one of their students phone goes off they shouldn't be able to take it but if it was out in plain view then they can take it but i think at the end of that class period they should be able to get it back but the teacher have to turn it off and let them know they cant turn it back on till the end of the day when they go home. 
They just want to say conspiracy theorists and not tell the truth 
Most importantly the canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote 
Now then lets take a dive into what your pending decision would impact upon us. 
This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.    
identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling 
Please allow us to bring our cell phones to school. 
having to always worry about paying car payments or getting gas can be very pesky knowing you already have to pay for housing,food,clothing and if you have kids supporting them. All that can be very stressfull and make life even harder to live with, like in source 1 mother of two, Heidrun Walter talks about how "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." 
A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to 
Yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are building creative thoughts that are just waiting to be used. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project helps give the schools notice of what future creator you are putting into the world. If the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about Independence, and that they don't need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. With student designing their own project it will make great business skills. 
It's more beneficial that they go to a public or private school because they are different types of people and you get more experience on the communication. For example, with doing a video conference most likely you'll be talking to the same teacher every day, while going to school somewhere you won't talk to the same one or couple of people. 
Our parents may have to go to work and the only time they can pick us up is at the end of the school day or our family can only pick us up at that time. 
If we continue to use the cars we use today we don't put our safety in a computer hands. 
I would like to thank u for reading this letter. 
By implementing online classes, schools should reassess the validity of its efficiency and the impact it will have on students. Virtual learning can have benefits, but is effective to a certain extent. Ultimately, the negative imbalance between the consequences and benefits of virtual learning suggests that online classes should not be encouraged within school systems and to continue to maintain a traditional form of education.  
I think that you should require all student to do a little community service, because of these three reasons. 
All and all school is a place for education some may debate , but along with education you need responsibility which some students lack. 
for instance some people think that community service takes time and energy that they don't have it really makes it impossible for them to do anything. 
tremendously decreases the time that a student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them. 
It can be argued that he electoral college method of slecting for the presisent may turn off potential voters for a candidate. 
so you can have more fun and so you don't have to get more tired from staying home and playing video games all day i just want to go outside to play more sports and get some fresh air and lose some of your body weight. 
The most importent thing about participate to school activity is you can spend time with your friend and teacher and your principal too, and it help students with there grades too. 
After reading the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" i have came to the conclusion that i am against these vehicals. 
being able to study tha planent you have to be on it and that diffcult because " a thick atmousephere of almost 97% carbon dixide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of hihly corrosive sulfuric acid in venuis atmoahere." and "since no spacecraft suurvived the landing for more then a few hours. maybe this issue explans why not a single spaceship has tuoched down on venus in more than 3 decates." 
But we the people also have a say in this economy on what we want not what the government wants it should be up to us weather we want a good leader or a not so good leader but now lets get on to some resons why th electoraal collage should let us the people be the ones to vote. 
When there is a tie, the fate of the potential presidents lie in the House of Representatives. When the election results are in the hands of the House, the selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. It will be more likely that they will vote for the candidate in their party rather than listen to the people's vote. Not only does it ignore the rights of the people, but this gives an unfair advantage to the candidate who's party is currently in power. 
Ill like to talk to you about us students being required to perform community service. 
Do you really think the electoral college should stay? The second source states that Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Does that make any sence to you? That even though the majority votes on one thing but they dont get that in a democracy? 
swing states 
Therefore this New technology is valuable for the students in classrooms.      
Summer is the time of the year every student looks forward to. Apart from socializing with friends, enjoying the fresh air, and participating in outdoor activities, students have the chance to assure their learning abilities through summer projects. 
learn in a more comfortable environment, 
"Its a good thing for computers to be able to tell human emotion?" Well Dr. Huang thinks it is a good idea. Now I dont know if it is just me but with all the robots taking over the world thing in movies but 
I support the electoral college because it allows you to voice your opinions in which who you feel should been president. It's also makes you feel that once you voted that your opinion matters. 
Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively. 
They can have navigation errors or may react to what could be seen as an oncoming car, but it might just be some animal or a harmless object. 
may have never seen the person that I now strive to become. 
i think since that we live in a good/bad community i think it would be good to help out the environment, or help younger individuals get a better education. Other community services require like babysitting, donating food, or donate money, not all community services are long and time wasting. 
The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen. 
Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some. 
But you see there is up side to using the Electoral Colledge. It can keep us organized and what i mean by that is it will help the pople know who exactly all comes with the vote of the presedent. It also makes it alot esier to just vote for one group instead of voting for all 34 people. It will keep the people from accsadentaly voting for the wrong group. It will help the poeple make there desion on what they think best and not hat they have been told is the best choice. 
If the rule does change i think almost every students will be happy to use there phones. Also its good for parents because they can call there kids and tell them if they have to walk home or they are getting picked up today 
In conclusion, the Elector College is why better then picking by the most popular vote for president.    
At the beginning everyone thought that aliens made this. "It has been shown in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!" 
their increased inclination to work on something that they find interesting, 
My question is, why do you care how the student is feeling? 
This is because kids study after school and do homework and are over their heads in homework sometimes and community service may lead to more missing homework and lower grades on tests and quizzes, especially during the end o the marking period when the quarterly assessments are the most important and also the biggest test out of all of them. Community service would not be a good choice for the students at SCHOOL_NAME because of these reasons. 
IF the kid wanted the teacher to know the kid would stay after class and tell the teacher the proble. i jiust dont think that there should be that kind of technology inside of a class room. 
Garvin says, "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground...you could have seen what they were." 
in conclusion i do not the think the author wants to visit venus because it is way to hot to even try to land there if we did land there you would melt it says in paragraph 3 that the enviorment would crush a Submarine that is accustomed to dive in the deepest parts of our oceans. venus has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequrnt lighting strikes to any thing trying to land on its surface. 
Extracurricular activities would also make students stay up at 10pm to finish their homework 
because the winner-take-all system makes it so candidates don't spend time in the states they know their not gonna win. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and you need at least 270 votes to elect the President. 
When you are happy and smile looking on the computer it going to detect, so how has you been. 
I don't think we should change it to the popular vote because then it wouldn't be fair on the people thats running for president or electors, 
In the article it says that " Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. 
Because it is all about the system of winners taking all. Some candidates dont spend time in the states. If they really know that they do not have the chance of winning. They say that this stuff is outdated and irrational. They are thinking of abolishing the Electoral College instead of keeping it. 
i know we are not allowed to use our phones 
This textual evidence shows that the Constitution was actually compromising what the people are fighting for and what is already used. This also tells us that the current Electoral College is what is needed and shouldn't be changed. 
Driverless cars could potentially help but often after time machines have been proved to fail or later experience problems. 
Teachers also control the classroom and decide what to do for the education of their students. 
One of the other important areas this could be used is in counceling. 
The electors are very hard working 
So in my opinion no I don't think they should use the technology to read emotions 
According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, "Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...." This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, "... those electors could always defy the will of the people," and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points. 
Driverless cars, are they all they are made out to be? I think not. 
The author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. 
Student's can still have fun over the summer while learning and preparing for the upcoming year. 
not all students are capable of handling the responsibilities that come along with an extracurricular activity. 
can cause issues with the law. 
I think it would be great to have something like this. The process beings when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face. They would go through all 44 of your major face muscles because in order for them to work they must move like human muscles. Dr. Paul Eckman the creator of FACS has classified 6 very important emotions then mixed them together with each with facial muscles. 
Students take will take their work very seriously and the teachers will check their work to see if they did it correctly. Students were offered this opportunity to take online classes so they shouldn't ruin their chances. 
We the people are faces with another way of voting. We can vote for whatever canidate we please and when done with we will see how many people voted for each canidate, and whoever has the most wins right? This system would most likely give one the canidates an unfait advantage. When Romney and Obama went head to head in 2012 obama won because the amount of Electoral votes, but if we did it by the number of votes it would have been almost completly tied in votes. since Romeny was born in the south most likely each state in the south would vote for Romney. Since Obama was born in Hawiia there is no state near Hawiia that would have the same oppinion 
The positive effect that the FACS has on the students is another reason why it will be vaulable in classrooms. 
I kind of agree with you because if you let somebody with a C average in a sport they wouldn't try their best to get it up because they are going to think "oh they let me in with a C average that means i can keep it that way." 
I think that you should have kids decide on going to do community service. and decide what time is good for them to go and do it! 
It could not be made by aliens because Mars can make land forms such as a face or something. 
Because computer are wrong everyday they are the smarts thing on earth but they still get stuff wrong once in a while . They don't know the true feeling of happy and sad . They just computers . 
Safety is a number one priority in cars and in life as a whole. If your car is safer to drive on the highway, it will reduce the cause of accidents and save you and others around you money. 
these companies are import in the completion aspect and are needed to enhance the innovation. I'm not saying the government should souly control the means of production of thes automated vehicles it is just practical that it be envolved in the production. 
Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. 
In this essay, I'm going to talk about the new softare, that is called the Facial Action Coding system, which can help the computer to knows if we are sad, happy or angry. Putting the example of the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's called Mona lisa. 
Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people. 
Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. 
This is why it is so important to ask multiple people opinions because they may be bias to the subject or don't want the best for you. 
Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades 
The world/ it's people shouldn't have to be controled by the government or whatever to be told when they can leave their house in a car, it's so stupid. 
The use of a mobile device while operating a vehicle should be prohibited. Now is the time to admit that driving while using a phone or any mobile devices is dangerous! You wouldn't want you or a loved one to end up critically injured, dead or disabled. Phone usage while driving is one of the many reasons accidents happen everyday. You can always wait until you are out of the car to make that call or answer that text !   
But every vote counts, and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite 
We have all hear about this "Face" right 
If they want to make excuses, maybe you could have them do a couple more hours of work. And for theBecause students are fully capable of doing good for their community 
, gives teachers a better understanding of what students are passionate about, 
I strongly believe that this is not an alien, and that this is a natural landform.                              
we should have field trips going to homeless neighbor hood and helping teens ,kids ,and other people 
A copious amount of books are accessible in the school's library and can easily be checked out without the student needing to find transportation to the closest public library. Devices such as computers, printers, and laptops can be used by students to complete and turn in homework. Various teachers in schools have gone to college and are experienced in their subject and can go more in depth into learning material if a student did not understand it. Teachers can also explain topics in a way that allows all students to understand it since people learn things in different ways. For example, auditory and visual learners benefit from online classes more than students who prefer hands-on experiences. Schools also have enough funding to be able to provide outside-of-class learning such as field trips to museums and inviting guest speakers. 
These lessons we learn, will hopefully pay off, such as getting reprimanded for doing something bad.Do you think someone who is extremely bad, for example someone who is always getting in trouble in school for misbehaving, should be allowed to be rewarded?Well that is not right because he thinks that he can be bad and do anything he wants and still be rewarded in the end.He is not being taught anything and it isn't fair.How would you feel if you were a student who did good in school, got good grades, and tried your hardest while some other student did bad and took the easy way out and was rewarded in the same way? 
More and more teachers are reverting to teaching methods solely based on note taking and book work.Not only does this bore students to death but it awakens a rebellious nature within them that causes them to use their cell phones.The method many students want learn with and will learn by is hands on experiments and class discussions.This way students will feel more important and unique by being able to participate in class.They will want to learn more and strive to do their best.
Every year, school concludes at the start of summer, making summer synonymous with freedom as children have escaped the monotony of school life. However, as children get older, students increasingly have to make a larger commitment to learning and school. This often takes the form of more homework and projects during the school year, but also utilizes the extensive freedom and free time of the summers to keep students up to speed with their academics and prepare them for the next year. However, a debate around this topic has arisen. The question is whether summer assignments should be designed by teachers, or by the students that theses assignments most effect. 
NASA should stop this because it could be just a natural landform. 
The advantages of limiting car usage would help decrease, or even eliminate greenhouse gases. 
People often get stuck in serious situations, where they have to make important decisions. They usually get advice from more than one person. 
The popular vote allows people to vote on what president they want to vote for, 
Some people may believe that allowing students to design their own projects creates more work for teachers, putting stress on them. The teachers cannot have a uniform grading rubric and must have enough background knowledge on each student's topic in order to grade them fairly. 
This article is full of evidence to support the authors idea of studying Venus. The author referred to Earth, recommended ideas, and a technology project used with old computers to support their claim. In conclusion, this article had very well put-together evidence, and proves a point that Venus should be studied despite the dangers.          
they will be comfortable at home. 
But sometimes just looking at someone does not always workout as some people would like 
community service it will help us children with responsibility, respect, and discipline. 
we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States 
The next reason is that all students have a unique specialty to a certain class. 
kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. 
I hope that you take this letter into your consideration, and I hope you decide well on this policy. Some may disagree, some may downright despise the policy, but in the end, it does everyone a favor, and that's hard to argue with from a logical standpoint. In the end, it's the simple fact that education comes before all else, because it's more likely that one would become a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer than a professional sports player, and allowing the minimum work to pass won't help the student later on in life. 
Getting multiple opinion is a good thing. 
I think the author have a good reason to keep studying venus it is earth like with all the similar features besided from the high carbon dioxide and extreme storms and weather temperatures. 
Getting advice from multiple people rather than one person proves to have a massive advantage. It leads you to a larger supply of opinions which help you narrow down your options. It allows you to compare your pieces of advice which leads to the best most specific way of dissolving your crisis. And last it provides with you with an open eye or a larger point of view on how you would like you fix this. In my opinion if you do not try to receive more than five versions of advice from others, then you are going about it the wrong way.          
No one wants to do something when they don't know what will come out of it, and not only one person can help them. Sometimes people just need more assurance before they do something big, and talking to more people helps them a lot more than one person can alone. People talk to more than one person because they want their choice to be the best and most beneficial choice no matter what. 
i used to be in it but i got kicked out because my behavior and grades when i was in it i didnt put much effort like i didnt care about it but it was the only thing that had my grades good and now since im not in it i never have anything to do i wish i would have not behave the way i had so i would have not gotten kicked out but it is what it is 
The idea of allowing students to use cell phones during free time makes absolute sense 
In paragragh number 7 it says that all it takes is the drivers hands to be on the wheel for the car to go. "The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." Since the driverless car can do alot on its own the car could make it easy for a young child to get in it and leave while not being watched properly. 
Yes, I think technology is good for everyone because your computor can tell when you are bored, happy, and sad 
might end up the person guessing all the problems and not even caring. The next day they would see there scores in the test and be embarassed because they got there score low. 
I think that students should have to do community service. 
Oh! You are an atheast? Well then looks like we will have to have a nother conversation some time? Well until then, bye. 
At the University of Utah a survey went around asking students if they made better choice when they asked more people for advice or if they made a better choice when they asked one person for advice 70.2% said they made a better choice when asking more people compared to the 29.8% that claimed they made a better choice when asking one person. However, majority claimed the best outcome would be asking just more than one person, still a lot of students replied just one person. From past experiences asking one person can make you think that that option and only that option will be the best, when in reality its actually not. When asking for advice you need someone who gives their opinion on what hey would do, not try to snatch away your judgment and brainwash you to their opinion. 
The electoral college should be cancelled because there are too many things wrong with it. 
Being to relaxed can contribute to lack of attention in people and at home is the place you are most comfortable at so learning at home would just be a waste of time in my opinion. 
people might be late to work 
Isn't the goal of every school to inspire their students and bring them to a successful life? If the minimum became a 3.0 GPA, then students would strive to become better in school so that they may play their favorite sport(s). It would be a win/win situation: fantastic grades and a wonderful experience in their after-school sport. 
Music helps relieve stress and calm peoples nerves. It also helps people relax. 
Improvments on technology and cheaper technology makes it easier to build a smart car. An example of technology that has under gone this transformation are all the different sensors in cars. This technology is also making cars safe like an antilock break. 
Hearing several sides of a story or particular topic, can often have an affect on our decisions. Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions. 
The election of a president is a very seriouse thing that could ruin us or improve us we should start to pay attention to Mister State Sentor it could make a future for some people or cause war between people. 
No matter on how it goes,I say we keep the electoral college system..... 
it would also in the world of to day make him and his community be the butt of someone else's joke and no body wants that. 
Requiring "massive upgardes to existing roads, something that is simply to expensive to be practical." 
And students who choose not to pick up trash on their free time shouldn't have to be forced to did it 
so I think you need to do good in school to play or do school. stuff 
they can show they've learned over time and make it into a project where they show what they've learned. 
Well what if I told you that it was a good thing and keep asking for their opinions,and here are my reasons why 
Second of all people who favored the seperation of race. 
I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. 
and there will be a large amount of people helping the community. And you can start your own little group by you going on television and telling the people to start helping our community so that way we are not the only people helping it could travel out threw all of the earth and there will be a bigger difference. 
when I asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that I am working on a report for school. This helps all of us out because know they know i'm working on my report which means I can't hang out right now and I reminded them about it and made them do it. In addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. This helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services. 
To get into better universities, they will not accept grades that are not exceptional, let alone standard. I believe these students are trying to "just get by" in their class work, leading them to become irresponsible, lazy, and completely oblivious to the fact that the better jobs out there require more than a "standard" degree. Most school athletes believe that right out of high school, they will be drafted into a professional sports career, and for some, it is true. However, the statistics of ever making it into a professional league is slim, and for those who don't make it, and sadly don't care about their education, and end up getting a job that pays little to none and wishing that they did what they were supposed to do in school. 
We could hold monthly annual field trips to various highways or if that may cause unnecessary commotion even a retiring home and visit with the elders. Any little thing could help. 
they should respect that because we have lives to 
In the passage, the article states that a classroom computer could recognize a stuudent becoming confused or bored (Dr. Huang). After that, it could modify the lesson similar to what an effective human instructor could do 
Despite their obvious dependence on them, teenagers are often banned from having phones in school. Although I could understand some concern, I believe this should not be the case at any school. 
Students that take online classes do have its benefits. For example, if you don't have enough credits, counselors tell students that are going to graduate if they do or do not have enough credits, they can take online classes. 
The Author talks about how the scientist have come up with a new old idea of using a computer made of gears and levers, 
Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it'll simply be easier for some. Mental illness can be very debilitating and can significantly affect a student's performance in school. 
I know this idea will go well with many students. Plus the service they do will get over before to late so they can get home and do any home work and any of there own things 
ANY STUDENT WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE SHOULD SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP AND SHOW THEIR REPORT CARDS. 
I firmly believe that this process should be abolished, and the President and Vice President should be chosen by popular votes. 
In addition, teachers would also benefit from the use of facial coding. 
People from all around the country don't think that the electoral college is a intelligent way of voting. So they are fighting changing the electoral process to popular vote rather than voting for a state of electors 
When you ask for opinions on which university you should go to after your high school graduation, the answers between your parents and the answers from your friends might be different. Your parents could say that UVA is better than a college in New York or California because its close to home. They could also say that UVA is instate, which means its less expensive. Meanwhile, your friend might say that the college in New York is better than UVA, because you get to experience the freedom of living in a completely new place while making your own decisions. They could say that places like New York and California is way more fun than staying in your hometown. 
The pressure of having a run-off election is nearly vanished by the Electoral College. 
At the seventh passage, the author states that, "Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile," suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. 
so lets put this new computer technolgy to work and lets put it on every school computer. 
The canditates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, he/she already has 20% of the vote in his/her pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting canditates "they" think is best, not voting the canditates their state thinks is best. 
Some people who are going agaist Elector college use this to trick people and make them go agaist it but if you know about Elector College this wont happen. 
That cannot be possible because , if aliens existed then why are we just finding them? Wouldn't we already have proof of their existence ? 
This is what I don't get about how things are being done to try an save our planet called earth . If you want to try an save some thing an make it better. Don't make a expensive invention an expect people to by it like for examlpe the hybrids or plug-in cars. People can't afford many things in life because money comes an goes without out you evening knowing it . So why try to start something new when its only making more of a mess that inventers are cuasing. 
reduce greenhouse gases. 
This will safe a numerous amout of people's lives and increase the amount of cars being sold by BMW. 
There are a lot of people out there who need help with your community service. 
The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice. 
it helps read kids mind whenthere upset and not happy 
Your first policy sounds great 
I understand the "wrong" part of it like in the 2nd source it says "If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry." meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. 
The streets will be cleaner, the buildings shinier, and the gardens greener.Everyone in the city will leave their homes with a smile on their face! 
It is definitely possible to create a self-driving car. 
Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people 
its a thrill for the presidents to share there thoughts for upcoming events to change the world. 
this comuter programe could help so many people be and do the best thay can at what they love. 
The creation of "smart cars" is new and exciting, but is it safe? 
The electoral votes are just unequal 
electing by the Elector College is way better than voting by the popular vote inthe United States 
Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  
The author proceeds to say that "the value of returning to Venus is indisputable." 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also knon as (NASA) are studing the Venus the closest planet to our home, Earth. Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star" because its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot 
summer is a vital time for students to take a break from the hardships of the previous school year. Yet, some teachers want to assure students continue their learning over the break. If a school believes summer work should be assigned, projects should be student-designed. A project designed by a student encourages them to take initiative in their learning, gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic, and still feel as if they had a break from school and its traditional dynamic.  
It is not far from right now to travel to Venus and we could it, we could get a chance to live Venus. If we can, we should be more comfortable. We need to study Venus and teach many people. 
It may be mistaken that it is unhabitable for humanity, but there is a possiblity for humanity to live on other planet. There is reasons for saying those things about Venus. This is an other aticle to explain why Venus is habitable for humanity. 
I understand that each candidate running for prsident has his or her own group of electors chosen by the political party but it depends if they chose their electors respondsibly 
it is a disaster factor, it is unfair against voters 
Distance learning could solve this problem. By creating a county wide virtual learning database, students can pursue their education without having to be in school. 
The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant. 
It would make you aware of people and people of there other contries and there needs. It might evan lead you closer to makeing something good in this world. It led Luke Bombergers family to do amazing things like hosta number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. 
the invention of driverless cars, 
If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously. 
We can't text and drive 
That is why I suggest making a popular vote in stead. 
Technology often has problems and cannot be guaranteed to work and not every student does not has access to internet connection. 
allows those who are sick or unable to attend certain days the opportunity to not fall behind, 
Did you know that in that in 2016 a projection was made by Tesla for the release of a car that can drive by itself with no human assistence 90 percent of the time driving? Many car companies are considering this new technology for their own car brand, but is it really in the best interest of the drivers? 
The next time you ever take advice from one person remember to just ask one more. 
Technology has made a big impact on the world today. The number problem with technology is CELL PHONES! We use cell phones all day and night. There have been so many accidents and mostly the cost of texting and driving. 
Challenges can motivate students into working their hardest and trying their best. While some may argue that challenging work actually causes students to be less inclined to do summer projects, it actually motivates them more. Statistics show that students who are challenged receive better grades than those who are not. If students were to organize a summer project, they would more than likely leave out any form of a challenge, students would much rather have free time than work on a summer project and that would lead to students designing an easy summer project that requires little effort. Teachers on the other hand, give students lots of work so they can gain the information in a much better way. Summer projects aren't made to take up all your free time, they are made to make sure the information that was being taught during school actually stuck and that students fully understand it. Teachers who challenge their students are the teachers with the highest passing scores. 
Refering back to the article it says electoral avoids the problems with elections , with that no canidate recieves no votes from that majority. 
teacher asks:What is an electoral college?my answer:The electoral college is a process, not a place... 
How does the idea of cars that are able to be used on it's own sound? As in the article, it states that driving laws want to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If we go "smart" everything will be technology based. Which is just one reason for an internet crash and more technical problems. 
The electoral college is a process,not a place. are founding fathers established it so that congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president 
As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. 
Some schools require that students complete projects over the summer. In my personal experience, they have all been teacher-designed, 
There are both positive and negative aspects mentioned in having a driverless car. 
Back to what i was talking about, yea it would be cool to live in another planet, but those people that nasa is going to send out ton explore venus, have to explore it really carefully. I find it really interesting how there is a similar planet to earth. 
In conclusion , FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored , and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office , or even in the dentist area.   
The next reason I have is the Electoral College requires the people running for president they have appeal to all regions and not just the west because they were born there or something like that. 
Well thank you for taking your time and reading my essay. This was a good topic to argue about. I hope my responce will help to understand my point of view of things. I really do hope that we do keep what we have going on with the voting thing. I really do not think we should not change anything. So have a good day and once again thank you for taking the time and reading this.                        
its outdated. 
This technology is realiable at some points, theyre are multiple ways it can help and then there can be some disfunctions. Every technology has their flaws though. 
Inconclusion when the students have more time is more easy for they each day, and also they have time and their home, this is important for the future. However we need to study more in home or school, because this is important for us and many time we think that study in our home is hard but is interesting study more not only in the schools the student need take more time for study in home because is more easy when the school give one option for this reason the students need study more because is the best always when we are students good,and many time the students lose the opportunity that the school offer. Also we need more time for study because many times we have time for an others thing,but not for study,when the schools give the opportunity for be a good students in the life. And the most important is when the effort from today is the most important for the future because in the life only exist one opportunity,and for this reason we need to study more don't matter if is difficult because our future always is the most important.     
A reason someone might not ask for advice might not want to get advice beacuse they might think it will make them look weak for asking for advice. A second reason someone might not ask for advice might be beacuse their nervous to ask. A third reason might be because they might won't have that much people they can ask for advice. 
Quite frankly, classes may be taught out of this ideal classroom and at a home, with a television and a bed. Although most people may believe televisions and beds are distractions, these objects might just help influence a student's mind into thinking deeper and creatively. 
Another reason policy two could be better is because most rumors start of as a text or something someone posts on like facebook. 
there is certainty of outcome 
Kids that are doing so for example should not be restricted from school activities like so just because of their grades, the should be helped. 
As a human tendency, people are more likely to work on something they are interested and excited about. The more the project is worked on, the more complex and thorough it will be. Interest and excitement in a topic positively affect the extent to which the project will be worked on. Typically, the time spent on the project is directly related to the overall understanding of the concept. Considering teachers assign summer work to assure students continue learning during their break, projects should be student-designed as they promote a deeper understanding of the given topic. 
its bests to vot eby what the people want in able to keep a good country. 
However, students would not benefit from learning from home because schools offer face-to-face help, minimal distractions, and project-based learning that helps students learn essential life skills. 
they´re many sensors and techology to do with the car, who is to say they couldn´t malfunction, or intercept waves a sentence from paragraph 4 indicates my fear,¨For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors....Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, rotatin sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors....¨ and much more. 
Stated in the article "coulds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." Scientists could find a planet that could be similer or alike to Venus and they may need a drone strong enough to survive the harsh conditions on the planet. 
What determind this simple materpice.This was not exantly come word for work but the wrighting shows it need to be based off older pictures. There is ovisely is estmation in the pargrafe. Unfortionly but not uncommon there was some gussing.Why was the picture recoreted.The lovely picture of Mona Liisa was to make it look better. The suftware was crated for 6 different emmotions, happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Disiner of the sofware used was Dr. Paul Eckman. The reson why the sofware was indrectly used for this project.How was Mona Lisa redoneThe simeple ancer is computers. Also, there is sicince to derturmin how female faces have change over the years. There is also talking to pefrenciles to recrate it.A face is not just a picture if is a way of life. 
Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. 
The election of the president is every four years. This gives people time to decide on a new president and who they want representing their votes. 
Some reasons usually brought up that haven't been addressed yet are the issues of laziness with the animated movie WALL-E coming to mind 
Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than poeple who thing that single vote may decide an election" (Posner, Paragraph 23). 
an individual can become more knowledgeable from opinions from multiple people. 
become socially inept, 
thats why i agree cause i always wanted to know what people are feeling. 
but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely "car free" 
This is not a practice that is condusive to their future and cannot possibly be maintained healthily, thus showing that distance learning is not realistic. 
That way it will be a fair decision by the people for the people. 
Summer projects have long been a popular way to ensure that students continue learning during their break. Ranging across subjects, summer assignments encompass everything from math packets to reading lists to art projects. These assignments can be either teacher- or student-designed -- two different styles of learning, but both with the goal of preparing for the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects often focus on important information for the class and student-designed projects often focus on exploring their interests. 
In conclusion, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and there for the case of the Face on Mars was a natural monument after all. It compared to West America for all of the weird thing that they have. 
The eclection is basically in the "Swing" states because the election is so close. So i guess the smaller the better. "The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational." Says Bradford Plumer in the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong." 
It should be a freedom to vote after this is a free country. We also have the freedom of speech why can't we have a freedom to vote. I may understand that not all people are from this country but reall who is thatb is what make us different but, if we would understand it well be better for every to vote. That way it will be more fair than having only those that qulify. 
"It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college" (Plumer, Paragraph 14)! The voters think the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. People vote for a candidate but the outcome is not what they were expecting. The candidates that get the most popular votes deserve to win! 
they have tried to explore Venus for many years and they can't succed 
if you don't undertand simething you can ask to the teacher 
If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us. 
Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the "Traffic Jam Assistant," which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car. 
"It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes". 
At the end i think that there's no need for you to know if the person if feeling bad or happy .What if the person is feeling not so good because of family issues? As a person , we wanna just move on and not remind are self of what just happen because it'll make us more disapointed then we already are. I think that less technoloy makes people less crazy and less stressful. The new technoloy is going way to far for this to just makes this up and just imagin something even worst that they made up off. 
for those who believe that community service is a waste of their time 
According to the second artlice under the elctoral college system, voters tates vote for one person thevote not for the president. in second passage it says the single best agrument against the elctoral college is what we might call disator factor. in artilce 2 it say at most basic level , the elctoral college is unfair to voters. 
Election by popularity should especially be approved in all states because each states should have the abitlity to vote for who they want instead of living in hope for who they they want to win 
According to the author, " they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all designed to notify the driver. That defeats the purpose of calling them "Driverless Cars." Why call them driverless cars if they still need a driver. It is not a smart idea. 
That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. 
because of academic ability 
"The challenge of studying Venus" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. 
on the other hand teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. 
Final reason is managing time is what you need for jobs therefor if you are learning it early own the essayer it is,and to lost of people this is a great skill to have therefor this quality will get you many jobs since you know how to. Work your schedule therefor there work on time team projects have time on your schedule and someone cant make it they type of people often help out and get promotion or get played into a low payed job but that docent really happen often. 
Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do. 
As you can see i have some good reasons on why you should not make it mandatory, but if you feel like students need to provide more community service then use some of my ideas. As a student i think that if use you use at least one of those ideas that i stated then more students would join. 
As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons 
Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. That year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from "Phantom Menace" to "The Jedi Return". But i decided to write about "Revenge of The Sith" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. I honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one I was and still am a pretty weak writer. But eventually I came around to write about Anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. Now keep in mind I had finished about a week into summer so I was pretty much free to do what I wanted. That same summer I had traveled to Honduras for 2 and a half months to visit. But as soon as I returned school was satrting and I had completely forgotten about the assignment and to put the icing on the cake It was lost. 
I know that there is risk but it is worth it. You get to have fun and have a good feeling in your heart, all for just helping people in need. I am grateful for the oppurtunity, and it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. I do believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth it. Who knows maybe you'll become the next one.                    
But then at the same time i still do agree with Joe, but at the same time i do not beileve with Joe. I know you are wondering why i am saything i agree then turn arounf and say i don't . 
There is 97 percent of carbon dioxide in Venus and plus more of a challeng is the clouds of highy corrosive and eve 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It makes it a little hard to be able to go on Venus because of all that. 
I also thinks its time for a change and I believe that this will bring up students grades. 
Schools should offer fully online learning to students 
First, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the many rewards of studying Venus 
Student and teacher interactions in person can develop connections and a sense of trust that will help students better understand the concepts that specific teacher is teaching them. Online classrooms put a physical barrier between teachers and students which prevent any of these interactions. For example, my chemistry class does a flipped classroom, which is a teaching style where students are sent home to watch videos on the concepts of chemistry that we will later apply in class. I could wrap my head around some concepts, but some things just seemed unclear. When practicing writing out chemical reactions on my own, I had many questions that I needed to write out with my teacher in order to clarify. It was not until I came into class that I could sit down with my teacher and write out reactions with her that I fully grasped onto the concept. Similar to myself, it seems like most of my peers are hands on learners, where they understand concepts best when actually applying them and going through a process. This is an effective learning style consisting of developmental progression through the medium of a mentor, which in this case is the teacher. Online sessions lack this physical medium students can work with in order to fully understand concepts they are being taught, leading to ineffective education that will not benefit students. 
i think that yes if they put their mind to it. 
Being kicked out of school can be good or bad. 
I belive that driverless cars will afect peoples saftey. 
The Electoral College restores and reduces some of the weight of the electoral by its population. 
sensors and displays in the car that allow you to focus on the task at hand when you are driving. 
Because of the major systematic flaws, and the ethical dilemas accompaniing this issue, it is clear that at least for the time being, the efforts to integrate emotion detecting software into the the cassroom should be put on hold. Though this is an astonishing advancement in technology, there is much to consider before pursuing this movement. 
I propose abolishing the electoral college and replacing it with a simpler system that appeals to all united states citizens instead of just certain citizens. 
the death rate will go decrease 
The electoral college in many peoples eyes is a good thing but, there is a majority of other people who would much rather have a more direct vote because all though one president got the popular vote among the voters, the electoral votes count differently. One direct vote could count for ten votes or it could count for two votes and most people would rather have their vote count as just their vote. 
creates a better mindset for disgruntled students. 
In my opinion, I strongly believe that cell phones should be turned off and put into people lockers during the school day other than allowing students to have their phones at lunchtime. 
Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states "no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. 
They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few. 
In the introduction, the author is describing Venus and explaining how "The Evening Star." Is the nickname, but beyond that- paragraph 1 and 2 wasn't explaining why you should pursuit it. 
We dont vote for electors  ... so many people can vote on one paticular person to be head of our state and president and the other person can only get 3 votes  but in ellectoral collage he/she can have more electoral votes and they win the election .. even tho the other canidate has more popular votes. 
As you can see,getting rid of cars would be very beneficial to our society. Our air will be cleaner,streets will be safer and best of all,we'll have more money to spend.    
As most of you know, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday afer the first Monday in November. This is when there are two candidates running to be President of the United States 
If the option to opt out of joining an extra program is stripped from students, the qualities of the clubs can and will decrease 
if we weren't allowed to bring our cell phones to school we would have to use a school telephone and that could take a long time. 
Kids wont do their homework if they arent here. 
It takes a long time to vote for you and could be faster.  
What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife. It's different how the Da Vinci code is, with converting their specific emotoin with the new electronic code.    
Clearly, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
You can avoid texting while driving by texting before you drive. You can avoid texting while driving by texting before you drive. Henceforth, having safe driving habits all start with keeping both hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and mind focused on what's happening. Moreover, texting and driving may have a reachable desire but there is a solution by placing your phone out of reach. Above all, placing your phone out of reach helps you pay attention to driving instead of wondering what your messages says. Additionally, to prevent texting while driving simply ignore your phone by turning it off. Drivers safety websites notes to turn off your cell phone. Let your voicemail capture your voice and text messages. In summary turning your cell phone off will prevent any possible accidents making a safe environment. 
Summer is the only free time students get in the school year, they should at least decide what projects they want to spend their free time on. 
Student-designed projects that can spark student's creativity also help teachers, since it's much easier and safer for them just to let a student create it themselves. Sure, there is a chance the teacher might get it right, but it's not guaranteed. And finally, there's nothing to lose. Yes, kids might cram it in the week before break ends, but remember that most kids already do that. It's fair to say that student-designed projects are a win for learning, creativity, teachers, and students alike that we're missing out on.Student-designed projects both prepare students better for the next year while helping them consolidate what they've learned previously better than most teacher made assignment ever could, with few exceptions. So, while I don't think that student-designed projects are the key to perfect learning, but they are definitely a part of it.  
Though driverless cars may be a thing of the future, my vote is a no. Driverless cars are a bad idea no matter who is behind the wheel. 
Summer break is a time for everyone to decompress and relax after a long school year. Projects over break are stressful, especially teacher-designed ones. Breaks should be spent having fun and spending time with family/friends. Students work their butts of enough during the year and shouldnt have to do that over summer. 
some people have more experience than you in certain areas. 
which really does not give you the right to do that because people have always that right to vote. In addition to that it can lead to a big catastrophe. 
will say this to all the students.Why stay in the house all day playing video games, doing nothing, just watching television? When you could be helping someone in need or help the environment get healthyOne way you can help your community is by planting a tree, giving food to the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter or a homeless shelter. 
a good understanding, 
Driverless cars are very mechanical, probably costing much more than one's average car price. 
In the case, the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where state delegations vote for president. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina, and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. 
I know im only as smart as a C- average. So i say they should only have to keep there grades up at a C- or better to play any sport. Well look at them all most every kid has a C average so why not let them have a C average and be able to play in sports or other activities. If they have a B average then that's great but if they have at least a C average then that's good to, so don't you think we should be able to play sports or other activities if we have C` s? 
My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, "Most states have a"winner- take all" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate." The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. 
The Mona lisa demostration is relly intended to bring a simile to your face wihile .People are trying to do new ssttuf with new tecnology but some of this peoiple dont know that some times they do need to have or use tecnology they want to just do things as there way but some times they do need to use tecnology and do what they have to do so they can fix the old stuff and new stuff the monalisa just a little simle but they can fixii it withtecnology and try to do some thinh new they have to look for more tecnology and expressions to be sure that they are doing whta they have to do in expression of the wghat they have and maind. 
There are many advantages to limiting car usage, 
Another example is College, 
The ways that this argument would go could have many many problems even getting into the school. 
But there are many reasons why it's not. 
So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 
Although learning from the comfort of their own home may seem appealing to students, being educated through a screen is not as beneficial as the real life interactions that occur inside schools 
So limiting car usage is good for the community and pedestrians, bicycle can be a good way to get places it saves time , lowers emissions and improves safety so there are no more traffic jams. 
After reading this article "Does the Electoral College Work?" I've come to believe that we should keep the Electoral College because, look at all the rights and goods we have establish untill now. What im trying to say is that the Electoral College do work, 
For example, if a kid is in an argument with his mom, he may ask his dad, siblings or friends what to do. After he uses that advice, he may think that he will never need it again. Even though he may never need that advice again, lets say the same thing happens, and he gets into another argument with his mom. Since the first time he used the advice and it worked, why not try it again? When you give people advice in the future, it can bring back memories of when you were younger. A lot of people goon to share that advice with their parents, siblings extended family, friends, future spouses, and even kids. Even though you probably don't realize it, a lot of people actually use past advice in the future, almost as if it is second nature. Now when someone asks you for advice, it is most likely something you heard a while ago, that you are now passing on to other people. 
Google cars have been known to drive more than half a million miles without a crash . This showes that they are safe but arent completly driveless 
Beyond this, distance learning allows for students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which undeniably serve as a distraction to their academics. 
Traveling Venus would be dangerous in many ways. 
Second of all, Venus could someday be our second home or a place where we can visit. In the passage it states, "Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." 
I like how the the software of Mona Lisa is really intended to bring a smile to your face, but sometimes it could creep you out. 
In 25 of the largest media market a majority of voters did not go see any of the campaign ads. 
The Electoral College is way different than popular vote. Popular votes are actually done by the people and they pick who they want for president, but the Electoral College is done by a person picking someone of their state's goverment and then leaves it to them to pick their president. Te electorial votes are unfair because it deoends on how big a state's population is. Some states only have 3Electoral votes, but if that state used its popular votes it wouldA LOTmore than just three votes to one president. 
Consulting others for advice can help you do that. Perhaps your situation isn't as horrible as you thought, maybe it could be easily fixed and dealt with. People other than yourself can help you see the good things in bad situations. You could have this sense of relief from just consulting someone for their opinion. Simple as that! 
I believe that we should continue to use the electoral college to elect our presidents. 
What happens if one of those cars goes under a super malfunction or some of its safety units stop working for whatever reason and there is someone or multiple people in that certain car. 
it is their break time from school. 
president obamas ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse emmissions, unveiled last week ,will geta fortuitous assist from an incipent shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that america is buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer liscenses as years go by. that has left researchers pondering a fundamental question:has america passed peak driving? the united states with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the worlds prime car cultures. it is the birth place of the model T; the home of detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "mustang sally" just kidding im not gonna copy all of that. 
Not only would distance learning aid long-term home bound students, but it would also help the short-term ones. 
you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program becasue there is traveliling if you work 
cause at some point in time the people will start to get angry about the whole emotions crap and maybe get rid of them, they may like at first but one day their just gonna get rid of it. 
They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says "Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate (exept for Maine and Nebraska) it is being used for what they are using it for 
students who are already in a club or program outside of school would have to rush to or even quit the activity that they are enrolled in. 
I think"yes" students would benefit from being able to atted classes from home. 
This people have alot of money but they still want more and more, inportant people would brive this elector with alot of money, and they would be doing whatever they are ask for. 
If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week. 
I highly recomind keping the Electoral college. 
it starred in hollywood films appeard in books magazines and even raio talk shows and hunted grocerys store checkout lines for 25 years. 
They Electoral College has a massive rate in certainty of outcome 
Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning. 
Displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not to the drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the In car system is actually a safety feature, and saftey is a big concern. Most driving laws focus on getting the passengers,drivers,and pedestrians safe and let know the law makers that in these cars are safety. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes benz,audi,and nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car streches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination. 
the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals. Say the article only 270 eletroals are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrose as the election crisis in a century? Well i think so! 
They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. 
Extracurricular activities can help you make new friends. 
because it wouldnt be fair to citizens 
Also, the Electoral College should stay our way of voting because of majority vote. 
electoral college causes too much confusion 
I think you should go to the program I hope you like it 
But I also belive that no one should use them during class because it will be a bother to every one and they wont be able to get there work done because someone would be sitting in class just texting on there phone. 
it takes up our time to do things that we need to do 
Life can get difficult sometimes, and we might not always know what to do. No one wants to walk into a big decision blind, though. So, what can we do? Most people ask for advice. But just one person's opinion and experience may not be enough. 
Some students don't have enough hobbies, if they even have any at all. Making them choose an activity could possibly interest them in whatever they chose, and they would start to take up that activity as a hobby. 
But if there was aliens On mare why would they just make one landform that looks like a face if there was aliens on mars im sure they wouldnt just make one that looks like a face and dont make anymore. They would make more and more till they got tired of making them 
This article it also states that the "Face on Mars" is really just a mesa 
The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that larges states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. 
I think it would be a good idea if we could at least have our phones during free time or when we are done with all of our work as long as we don't bother others. 
I love the community with all my heart and I to get but asking students is not the way 
Now, im sure there are many many people that agree with me that we should get rid of the electoral college. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now 
When we have sports like that people stay out of trouble more. 
This means that a region needs to influence another to have atleast a elected president. For example, Romney was a solid regional(South) which means he focused in one region not the others, concluding his lost. So, it was very likely that Romney would not win because of his appeal to one region. 
one last reason is that it over rules the poeples vote 
I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that you should join it because I love it, I love working with the animals; I have a feeling you would too. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, you can't pass it up. You will also get to go sightseeing in a lot of cool, different places. 
I am writing an argument in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
When you are texting while driving you looking up and down while driving and I would suggest people should put that do not disturb on your phone or you can put it in the glove department, so you won't be interrupted while driving. 
different students are going to do their projects on different topics, If I had to do this project I would be very creative, And show lots of neatness, Also I would turn my project in on time. 
less stress upon the student, 
In this situation, the law should be made very strictly that person can talk hands free for only few minutes and eliminates other conversations while driving, only important conversations should be allowed. This law can save so many pedestrians too, who runs into a car wreck daily. One example is of an old lady in Atlanta she was run over by a driver in the evening and he didn't even stop after words two weeks ago, according to the news. The lady ended up dying on the street right on the spot. 
More evidence of it being worthy of studying is in Paragragh seven saying NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. 
it may seem unfair that the votes we are putting in is for the electors to run but its a show of value it shows the the electors get help with votes 
But on the other hand what is good about it is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism 
In reality most people think that the voting is unfair, like what happened with Presidnet Kennedy. 
Now back to what the downsides are of the electral college "The single best argument against the electoral college what we might call the dissaster factor." a part of Bradford Plumer's article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong." 
Policy 1 may only allow them at lunch, and other free times, but that won't stop some students from using them whenever they want, and abusing their liberty. 
"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. 
Well i believe this would be a great policy, if we, the students, didn't have to partake in all the practices or meetings. 
Another piece of evidence proving this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because in fact there are colleges out there that do offer video game based classes this could be another advantage 
Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president 
The text states that states like, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have limited use of semi-autonomous cars due to safety issues. A big concern is if you get into a car accident with a driverless car, who is there to blame?In order for driverless cars to be used they would have to set in liability law changes and who would be be blamed for the accident, as it states in the text. 
there is however some flaws to these so called "pros". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. 
There is so much more room for improvment but that is not happening. The advances weve made in so many aspects of goverment are not being translated into the electoral college. Its time for a change in our favor. 
Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do 
No I think that the Electoral College does not work, 
They get to vote who is going to be but, the Electoral College is consists of the selection of five hundred thirty eight electors. The majority of two hundred seventhy electoral votes is requied to elect the president 
Lending a hand in some way would teach kids life lessons we would carry with us for the rest of our lives 
Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the "Mona Lisa". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. 
Venus's is plant is formed just like earth But just with too much on it. strate from the" Beyon high pressure and heat, Venusian geologgy and weather present additional impedimments like eruoting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to prodes seking to land on its surface." Some scientist think that venus has youse to look eart and that it youse to support various forms of life,just like earth. From the text" The planie has a surface of rocky sediment familiar such as valleys, mountains, and craters." Thats how the scientist think that venus is just like earth. 
I pretty much don't beileve a computer can detect emtions from our faces when we could use a computer for many other things instead of emotions. What about our other emotions? gulity? curious? love? etc. How exactly can a computer detect our emotions? When a real human can detect it by the look of our face and talking about it 
it's bad enough we have to wear uniforms, now we cant have phone either. 
The teachers know what is best for the student and the material they need to be successful in the course. 
need more modifications. 
maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful. 
Venus can be save to resreach but what person would want to do at ?NOT EASY CONDITIONS , FOR HUMANS!   
i believe this could be a quite useful rule and cast my vote for the rule of no students participating in extra activities without an average of 79 or above. 
It realy grinds my gears, so to speek it isnt giving us freadom in the most free country in the world it is taking away our civil rights as citizens to vote. 
One reason why I think that this policy is the right one is because kids should have cell phones.It's a great way to communicate with your friends and family. 
Electoral College should be removed by the government and just have popular vote be responisble. 
I think many schools are starting to give out issued laptops to their students. If that is not the case or they dont have WIFI, they could always go to the nearest library and make use of the resources there. 
This is their time to represent with good character and attitude and also have fun and enjoy their time at school . Instead of not being able to play for having a "C" grade point average 
Garvin said"So,if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egtptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or meas. This debunks all explations of theorists every were. NASA has proven them selfs to not being the bad guys in a cover up. 
. Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time. 
The NHTSA says that at any given time, 660,000 people are using their cell phones while they drive. This means that 660,000 Americans are gambling with their lives. Distracted driving is a epidemic in America, and it should not be allowed under any circumstances. It is a deadly and costly endeavour that does not have any benefit to those who choose to participate in this affair. Texting and driving is illegal for a reason, because it has been proven that it should not be done. 
Like it says in the artcle "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" paragraph 21 number 4 that "a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .". So its unfair to the smaller states just because of the size all the states should have equal numder of votes. People might say like in the artcle "The indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" in paragraph 13 that the "candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning." 
To wrap things up, in my opinion i think this car is something that they should second guess. It might benefit some people & others it might put a steep hole in their pocket. Once again i feel as if there is no purpose of having a car if you're not going to drive it. 
I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home 
students to attend classes from home by way of online more benefit and against for students. 
.Being a Democrat myself the way the Electoral Collage is set up is absolutely preposterous. 
I also see it as unfair because the people that voted for one person and the majority is for another person their votes won't have any affect and will be pointless 
Some are just naturally shy and others just simply do not like working with others. For this reason, attending online classes at home is a great alternative for these students who are not socially comfortable. This way, students can complete projects on their own at home and they can stay focused on their tasks without the awkward feeling of having to worry about others at public school. Another strong quality of attending and completing an online course is that many online courses have fun and interactive lessons that keep a student engaged in the lesson, rather than sitting in a classroom and doing nothing because they are bored of the teaching or they are once again, just uncomfortable socially in a public setting. One on one online video conferencing is also easier for students to talk to their teachers if they need help because they may feel uneasy when speaking to a teacher or others in person. As a result, they also can learn things in an online course that they may not have ever learned if they were taking that certain course in a public school setting. 
I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations. 
I would like to in favor of keeping the Electoral College for many purposes 
- Venus is a cloud draped planet, it is often referred as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to Earth and sometimes Mars, humans sent spacecraft to Venus but unmanned because not one single spaceship has touched down in Venus in three decades, 
The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a wonderful idea in my opinion. 
the people, and the learning. If we did community service we would be a roll model for younger individuals and they would want to do community service as well and the cycle would keep repeating. 
we are very curious about it 
Greetings ,my name is Generic_Name. I go to Generic_School and I'm a junior this year. I was just recenlty informed that some schools require students to complete a summer project in order for thme to contiue to learn. But now the questions arises, should said projects be student designed or should the teachers design it? Although some would say teacher designed projects are better because the teachers have an understanding in the topic and can provide accurate deatils for better clarity. 
That means that the president was not picked based on who the people of this country wanted, but who only a small amount of people wanted.  How does that make any sense at all? There's no way to defend that.  
In another quote by the author and in the article "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like. 
In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever 
The other problen that is with this system is that the winer takes all 
For example, at a job you are required to check in at the time of the schedule handed to you not when you are ready and feel like it. 
Another reason students should be able to bring their phones is because some students would need their phone at the end of the day to call a guardian or relative for a ride home. 
The Electoral College is comprised of a total of 538 electors and to elect a president you need a majority of 270 votes from the 538. This electoral college is comprised of one vote for each representative from your state plus two for the senators. Obviously this gives every state a fair chance to vote but even if lets say Hawaii, North Dakota, and South Dakota wanted republican and Texas wanted democrat Texas' votes would cancel out the others because of the amount of representatives they have compared to the other three states 
In the Electoral College way of voting, it is "...unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state." Along with the fact that in the Electoral College way, the amount of electors is based on population, making the people of a small state insignifigant. "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all..." If all small states stay this way, they may never be able to have a say in any big decision made by the public. 
Making it a requirement would be best so that the ones who wouldn't do it if it was optional had to. 
they know what their students struggle on and could include some tips. 
One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A student-designed summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts - whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the time-managing aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them 
Another benefit is that students could attend distant schools that would not be practical to attend in person. Besides the saved travel time, switching to more online classes would eliminate a great deal of paper waste, as many more assignments and materials would probably be online. This would benefit the environment, and it would keep students from having to keep track of both physical and digital assignments and documents. Finally, school systems could save money on a great deal of physical infrastructure, such as school buildings, classroom materials, and buses. The funds saved could be redirected towards giving students computers, paying teachers more, or investing in better learning resources. Overall, the saved time and money from switching to more online classes would significantly benefit students and teachers. 
president Obama has abitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emission. I know that it will work out because I read that peopel think that america is pass the car age or what ever and that more and more people are starting to do whats right and start walking and riding bikes. 
A student's freedom from the limitations of the classroom's necessary rules during the summer provides new opportunities for them to learn in dynamic ways. While, in the classroom, a teacher's control of a regulated learning program is unavoidable in order to teach such a broad audience in such a short time, there are no such factors outside the classroom. The variable shape of a student's summer project provides a unique opportunity for the student's specific educational needs to be accounted for - which a teacher-designed project wouldn't be able to take advantage of. 
The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Also says in paragraph 5 that's not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above. There is different facts about everything. 
I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school. 
You can get advice from lots of different people, it can be good, or it can be bad. In elementary school I got into deep trouble because this guy was messing with someone else, I told him to stop, but he just started picking on me, but since I was in elementary school, he said something that caused me to break, so when he started to turn around, I picked up a rock and I chucked it at his back, luckily it missed, but I still got in trouble. The reason I did that was because my brother said if they hurt you, even with words, hit them back, that's some bad advice I followed. That's why I say right now, take advice that will lead you into the right direction, advice that won't cause any trouble, in middle school I'm surprised I haven't gone insane yet because there are some kids I want punch in the face because they mention race or call people names, but there is some advice I've been told that keeps me calm. One is these guys are my age, they can say what they want, but they are still my age, they can't do anything about it. Another is in the future I probably won't even see these guys, so once I tell myself that, I start to feel better and I show them that I could care less to what they are saying 
Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by giving them a taste of what their own educational freedom is like 
The driverless car is much more costly to manage than a car controlled by the driver. 
Community service offers an opportunity to kids and adults who feel they want to do something for the community. 
Hands on learning is the number one factor that differs online classes from regular classes 
On the other hand some people in the world are going to have to use their phones as a job. 
The face is just a great form of natural landform. 
I will like to argue about the Electoral College. 
and he feels it opened up the world to him. 
The reason is, because the cars really are not fully driverless. 
I think the electoral college should be changed and people old enough to vote should be able to chhose who they want to be president 
What would happen if after a while no one took care of our community? For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place. For example, maybe we can go 2-3 times a week picking up trash, even just starting with our own football field. 
When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part. 
Remember that these cars are still in the prototype stage of their lives, and developers are still working hard on making these cars as skilled as a driver as any human. 
State senator we need to get rid of Electoral College and upgrade to popular vote. It's just not fair. 
One argument against online classes is that they would stop kids from learning to interact in person. 
First of all, classrooms have a live, and trained teacher. Students are able to learn from someone that they get to know throughout the year. Interaction is easy with both the teacher, and with other students in the room. With a live teacher, the learner can ask and answer questions easily and receive personal attention concerning their individual issues with topics or assignments. This factor helps students maintain focus as they are able to quickly resolve confusion and the teacher can alert them if they begin to zone out or get distracted 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
Letting students design their own summer projects also prevents them from copying one another. 
This would result in a balanced lifestyle; a lifestyle that isn't overwhelmed with work. The balanced lifestyle would reflect in the student's learning ability, as they would now be more calm and focused to do their work. 
Even though Venus is dangerous to visit, astronomers still plan to visit Venus. Astronomers want to visit Venus still because it is the most earth like planet in our solar system. 
Were also kids we love to text and sometimes talk to our parents or grandparents or someone like that. Some students may also be shy to talk to the people who go to our school. Its just something that takes some time to find out 
Limiting car usage does not affect car companies, but instead supports it. 
The Electoral College process consists of selection of the electors 
The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, President Obama recive 61.7 percent of the electoral votes copared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and for Romney. Because the total number of votes 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. 
In conclusion, People should go into Venus because it show on new opportunities and find new things we didnt know about. 
of course you know the electoral college is a bunch of representitives from every state tha have a president in mind when they go to vote in the meeting of the electors. it basically mean your not voting for the president directly,your voting for the electoral to (hopefully) vote for your canidate that you supposedlly "voted" for. 
Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, 
We should be able to pick our own president rather than having other people decide for us 
First of all, emotion has to do with what you're thinking about 
A common challenge that schools face is the maintaining of a "learning environment", although this may be difficult to deal with, this would be impossible for online education to fix. The transfer of learning from schools to the home would cause the "learning environment" to cease to exist. 
Based on phrases in the passage, there is evidence that the electoral college system is corrupt. An example would be:Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)-source 2, second paragraph.This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960. 
What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? 
Although allowing students to create their assignments would most likely be more enjoyable for them, 
So as far as we know their are no such thing as aliens. On Mars there might be pictures or thing that looklike an alien but its not it a fairytale our mind thinks it saw one but you never did. As i was saying there is no lifeform on mars, 
An in-school education strives to mimic the workplace environment. An example of this is the push for "hands-on" learning in the classroom as a response to criticism about lecture and textbook-style education for a more realistic alternative. 
OTHER_NAME , american citizen and community service program founder , says " doing community service is not a time waster if it's helping your community ! " Not helping your community is like not helping someone that really needs help , heartless! 
And so becouse of facts such as it being equivalint to a landform commen around the american west i belive it is not alins. so i hope this proves thate the face is just a natural landform.    
There was a natural landform that looked like a human head, shadows gave the rock some eyes, a noes, and mouth. 
In Conclustion, Venus is very hard to get to because of it condtions there but it is survivable for humans. NASA has tried many times to get on Venus but they have failed many times. 
The author support's the idea by saying ," Each previous mission was unmanned , and for good reason , since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours . Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades . Numerous factors contribute to venus"s reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study , despite its proximity to us ". 
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" believes that studying Venus is something that should be done even though it can be very dangerous. The author gives multiple reasons to why we should explore the planet, or learn more about it. However, some people think the dangers of Venus outweigh the benefits of pursuing research on it. 
t help the community in times of need. For example, when you are driving down a busy road or highway you see people throwing bags, cigarette buds, and even clothes out windows of their cars, not worrying about were they end up, in sewers, on the sides of roads, even inside animals. There are some types of community service that actually pick up all this trash around a city. This is important because it teaches character and it makes the city look better and more professional. Another example is that it community service could help other people in the community. There are elder homes where people drop off their elders that can't take care of themselves and people take care of them there. Some workers use this for community service or that is even their job. It can help you in the future to teach you how to take care of elderly people and it even help the community so the people that work out in the city don't get slowed down by having to take care of them. It could also make the elders feel wanted and feel comfortable in a new home. This is why our principal should require community service. 
Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial? 
Even though the team had got the picture everyone was no so happy still. The camera that they had on board had peer wispy clouds. The aliens was hidding by the haze when the team had taken the ten pictures. Image 3 was way bigger then the pixel size they thought it would be 
In the article it also says "NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. This is why the author suggest to study about Venus. 
The caption said " huge rock formation". This resembled a human head formed by shadows with the illison of eyes, mouth, and a nose. 
If you ask multiple people for advice you would get tons of point of views you have never seen or even thought of, 
I being a person who very much appreciate the place we live in, have decided to write this letter to tell you why community service should be required for at least 10 hours every school year 
They would send ships that are unmanned,because when ever they would send people that were inside the paceship they would not survive the landing. That is the main reason why they havent landed there or try to land there in three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus. The passage states that "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in venus Atmosphere. On the planets surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,And the Atmoshperic pressure is 90 times more greater then what we experience on our own planet". 
They could be happy, sad, surprise, angery, disgusted,and afraid. 
Also it will make it cleaner and not filled with garbage. 
in Vauban, Germany a residents of this upscale community aew suburban pioneers, where people have given up their cars. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes.The residents are trying to make cities denser, and better for walking for the past two decades, so Vauban, home to 4,400 residents within a rectangularsquare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. In United States, the Environmental protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. 
Even for the school assembly's or games they would not pay attention and just be on the phones regularly. The parents would get mad for the students not getting an education, and possibly fail there classes. Parents will get furious and file a complaint. If there phones go on in class teacher, and students will get distracted for the people who want to learn and will not get there education. When people try to study at the library they will pretend to study but use the phone when the test comes will not no what to do. When they are taking a math test they will cheat by using there phone as a calculator. While the teacher is on the board they will start to use there phones and not learn anything. While they are going to a class they will be on the phone, what if there was stares and they were to pay attention to the fall and trip or fall? they would really injured and school would be held responsible. While they are walking if they hit someone you never no if someone will find it like if you hit them on purpose and try to hit you back. In the morning when there waiting for the bell to ring and there on the phones when the bell does ring they would be late to class and just lie to the teacher and do it again. 
I think you should let the students that want to do community service do it 
You would have to let your state elctors also have the chance to let them pick a canidate chance on who they would want as president. According to theOffice of the federal register they qoute "The Electoral Collge consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to electoral votes is required to elect the president" (source 1). Each canidates electors are chosen threw witch partys they are in and are also chosen to give a chance to vote. I do think we should keep the Electoral college because it gives a chance for even electors to vote. 
People from the NASA think that aliens built the face on Mars, but actually it is a natural landform. 
My Opinion is that they need to change Electoral College. 
The system is called the Facial Action Coding Systemis now on variety of industries. 
I favor of keeping the electoral college instead of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it is fair. 
Through this, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. Source 2 refers back to the 2000 campaign, saying, "...seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." How can a president be properly elected with this system in place? 
Going to friends, family, or someone else you trust for advice is a great way to have more input while facing a decision.These people could have a different point of view on the matter, have more experience on the topic, or they've made mistakes and can help you learn from them. 
There's a lot to be said about the Electoral College... Both good and bad, but in the end there isn't much anyone who is normal and whose vote barely counts for anything can do.  We can say how bad it is however much we want.  We can throw at you facts upon facts about how unnecessary or unfair the Electoral College is.  In the end, it's up to the government to decide what will happen, as it always has been. 
When running late for work or school, you can easy just have your car start and drive as you are preparing for a meeting, answering missed calls or texts, or simply applying today's makeup for school. This also gives you a chance to sleep in later and be more rested. There are so many teens and adults who lose lives because of people who slip a text and look down from the wheel for five seconds. This could stop with driveless cars. With the growing software and media over the years, engineers have managed to do the impossible that we only see on television in the movies as it says in paragraph two 
It could be that they want to see what other's would do in a certain situation or, just want help and they know that whoever they are asking has been in the same situation before and know how to help or have a suggestion for you to try out. And most people rely on second opinion's because they rule out any other options. For example, if you are debating on buying something that you want, you look at the rating's to see if other people liked it. This counts as an opinion. Or you look at the comment's section to see if it's actually what you want and if people think it's worth it. Getting a second opinion helps in everyday life. People are alway's asking for second opinion's without even realizing it. You do it all the time by asking if your hair looks good or, if they like what your wearing today. It's just a mindless thing we do. We even do it in our head we think about what people would say and we ask them what they think. It's just something everyone does all the time because it's a self conscious thing we all do. 
Mr. and Mrs. Smith get prepared for the elections, which is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. They're both really assured on who they are electing, Mr. Keen, the remarkable Republican canidate. Mr. Keen would most definitely operate in Mr. and Mrs. Smiths' favor, due to the fact that Keen offers a convinient medical insurance for they're family, opposes of abortion and is projecting sites for the unemployed individuals. Clearly, candidate Mr. Keen is a go for the Smiths'  family, but what if they're doomed of their vote not getting qualified due to the systems', such as the Electoral College? 
I think all schools should have a community service program. 
so today i will be talking about my opion and how i feel about his whole little computre experssing reader and how do it will it worki and i feel that affects people 
i still think that the electoral system is a way better way to help choose a president. There is step to choosing him. There are people that already know what to do with there job, its easy for them. So many times they did it that they are professional at doing it. If we would change it, like I already said they would be confuse, lost. In my opinion the electoral system is way better an easier. Everything is known and better. Its in the constitution 
Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day. 
say they can have a C average in their grade the school would be a lot better place and wouldn't be as boring as it is. 
Feeling tired after a long day of working is very common 
I understand your concern about students grades and education, but being unfair to students that have a grade C average is unexcitable 
winner-take-all system doesn't work. 
Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen. 
For example, if you needed to write an unbiased paper on the pros and cons of making abortion legal, asking more than one person would limit the scope of the bias. If you only asked one individual, their statements could be tainted if they had a preexisting opinion on the topic 
If something were to happen they could tell there parents what is going on or if they get in trouble they could text or call there parents to say "pick me up at this time because i have to stay after" 
If that person didn't tell anyone that's because they wanted to keep what was wrong with them to their self. 
Many students would benefit from attending classes at home. 
Although you never know whats going to happen when exploring new things scientists find it very intresting to keep exploring Venus to keep finding out some of the features it has and maybe what it even used to look like. Venus is the second planet from the sun so its still very hot. 
Although, I am claiming to be on both sides of this situation, it may be that I would never purchase this type of car 
Students should not have to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports 
Extracurricular activities are good for everyone. For example you might want to go into acting or sports. 
Even though it says that Electoral College electors "...that trust is rarerly betrayed." 
Less lung porblems or other desieses. fresher air and less enviromental problems like global warming. Even smog in Paris or Beijing, even China. 
This means that the more options you have, the easier it is to do the right thing. Others' opinions can stop you from doing the wrong thing. When they tell you their end it may impact you and stop you from doing something you wouldn't have wanted to do. Others' opinions can also show you what consequences there might be for your actions. They might tell you the possibilities of what might happen when you say that. People opinions can greatly impact what you do. 
Another reason why I wouldn't encourage putting this policy into action is because a grade C average isn't considered failing, and in most schools for activities they won't let you participate if you are failing, but it would be fine with them if you had a grade C average. 
the citizens deserve to vote on who ever they think will help are country. 
set expectations for work ethic and quality of work for assignments throughout the year. 
In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are. 
it also reduces air pollution. 
Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars had driven more than half a miliion miles without a crash.In 2013, BMW announced the devolopment of "Traffic Jam Assistant." the car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills ,such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situations requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs.GM has devoloped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under considerartions are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.Tesla has a projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. In 2020 the cars that would be able to drive by themself are Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan. 
Some family members may want to know that but will never know if they don't have the FACS. The FACS seem to be good on paintings so I was thinking that it may work on a dead body. Becaues if it works on Mona Lisa, then it should work on anything that dont use muscle ever or in the past like a dead body. 
the people nw just think it do more stof but the don't think what we will do with all the things what we don't need and maybe in this world we dont have pace jus for put all that. 
I write to argue in favor of the Electoral College. 
they can have fun with it. 
some of this states didn't even see a campaing ad how sad is that because this country is know for the equalness off every one but yet the electoral college forgets about seventeen states that are small because their vote doesn't matter.? 
Additionally, precalculus is a particularly easy class for me, so I often find myself sitting at my desk doing nothing after finishing the practice problems early. If I were to attend class online, I would be able to finish the lesson quickly and efficiently, shortening a 90 minute lesson to 30. Therefore, online courses enables students to utilize the time needed to take in and comprehend a lesson. 
Sally Sue, secretary of the Bayview High Middle School say that, "Finding out who you are and your strengths is a very important thing for this world and who you want to become." That is a very good thought, I think that who you are is an important thing for you to figure out. Even from just doing a silly extracurricular activity you can find out what you are good at and what you can accomplish for life up ahead. I know a friend who is doing a yearbook and photography club, and maybe that is her way of finding out if she wants to do photography when she is older or not. It is a great way to find out if you want to do it in the future. 
Student-designed projects allows flexibility during summer break. 
He also uses NASA as a resource to help with the support of this idea. NASA is a wide known for space exploration and research for our solor system. 
One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature 
but remember if they don't or if they do they do its not our choice if they want to live in a bad or good community their the ones that want to be dirty and disgusting people not us. 
To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, "...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." It's a positive thing to have "car-free day" because less accidents mean less people getting injured. 
I feel that driverless cars could be both a harm and a help to people. 
you could help people over seas and in other countries. 
you meet new people and friends by staying after with all the kids from your school, 
Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because off the insight to eb gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
Why would the author ignore the dangers of venus 
Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it can help create a healthier environment. 
Next reason why is because your friends , they want to say forget about that and come hangout but while you are with your friends you can get into trouble or do things you are not suppose to do. 
The yearbook is made annually by students, and is good to put on your resume if you want a career in photography. Helping out with the yearbook actually helps the school too. If students like the yearbook, they will buy it, which gives the school more money to spend on improving itself. You also get to hang out with friends while working on the yearbook, which is always nice. 
It really isn't a face on Mars it's either a natural information or a alien artifacted. 
The only major problem is the the system is out of date. 
beneficial to our knowledge on cars. 
All votes should count, because if they know that why should we even vote if some peoples don't count. It is like we want that president who ever it is at that time to win and no votes even matter. This part is disappointing in the last paragraph of the Article.It says "...for example, or republicans in California. Knowing their vote will not have effect..." Going back to what I said up in my second Paragraph, everyone needs to have their vote count. Everyone deserves a chance to say who they want to runa certain part in the U.S. should and should'nt be. Hello? Remember freedom of Speech whatever happened to that.If Congress keeps this up people can get mad and riot about that or do bad things to harm people or congress. We need everyones vote to count no mater what. We need everyone to have a choice or say in there votes because they are voting for that person because they think that they are best to run the country or a certain roll in congress. So it may seem really crazy to think we need this but we really do so that congress doesnt fall and then conflicts come. We need this to have everything in congress and the people of the U.S. to run corectly. 
All of my friends and I loved playing sports, like volleyball and table-tennis, in the empty holds where we kept the animals. We also shared stories and games that some of us had never even heard of. I learned many fun stories and games that I now pass on to others today. 
On the other hand, according to "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" (Parargraph 14) the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair 
The kids should want to do these things so they can join but if its not possible then it shouldnt be pushed on them,kids should have a choice if they wanna commit do something like that. 
how know what could be on the planet. If we do we should be real cafeul because there could be dangerous stuff there. Its an opertunaity to see what Venus good values are. We can also compare earth o venus. 
Most Children have at least 4 to 5 hours after school to choose what they want to do. 
Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. 
The electoral college is unfair to the voters because of the winner-take-all system. 
Americans votes no longer count when having the electoral college and do not vare for our opinion on whom we believe should become our president, they decide in what they think is bvest for us. "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irtrational". 
Students shouldn't need to participate in extracurricular. 
the elector collage vote is regarded as a non-democratic methido selecting a president. 
bad advice. when you get bad advice you what to get more advice from some one else 
In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.            
The second source that I used in researching this topic is called " In the defense of the electoral college." This article they give you five reasons to keep our method of choosing the president. That one that was best for me was that " Everyones's president" just beacuse  at the end of the day what's important is choosing the right president for the job that the reason this method was created. I read the part where it say even if we do let the people vote , some people will end up feeling like their votes don't count simply cause they live in a small town with a very low population. Exsactly how it says in the article "...a large state gets more attencion from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does." 
The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation 
from where is see it if it helps us why  not keep it even if it doesnt always pan out as planed we all have our problems but that doesnt mean that the government shuts us down it just means that the only reason we have those isssues are because not everything will go according to plan. 
My claim is that it would be cool to go into a classroom and be able to tell what mood your are in. 
the faces are just nautural land forms and not something supernatural 
If not a lot of children in the school take this opportunity then I recommend making community service a requirement to go to this school. 
Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes 
In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his or her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of of "Da Vinci Code"! 
Probably long ago just as it says on paragraph 4 that, Venus was maybe covered largely with oceans and it could have supported various forms of life just like here on Earth and Venus then also has some features that are analogous to Earth. 
Most people work hard because they don't want to be kicked off because they love that sport and don't want to get off the team just because they couldn't pass a class in school because they weren't studying or doing their class work. If it was me having that B and working my butt off to get that A for report card and i almost had it but then she wouldn't let me have it because i turned something in late i would be disappointed to see me leave my team in the dust . 
According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winner-take-all" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters. 
Although some may argue that when a student takes classes online, parents can guide them through their child's lessons. 
like me many students do after school activities such as sports or academic UIL activities and these require many hours of long hard work well after practice for theses events is over you need a ride over and since the majority of the student body doesn't have cars we need a way to contact our parents 
Even when his internet is fixed, there's an high chance that he'll get hacked. 
I believe everyone has the opportunity to seek others opinions to make a better choice by involving others, 
then there is no reason that semi-autonomous cars should not replace the commercial vehicles that we see today. 
We need to complete it so that we can understand things so we can grow up to get a good college, and have a good future. Our parents and even you put enough stress on us about these things so why would you go ahead and give us more things to do when we already have a lot of stress on our backs. We have about 7 class a day all which assign at least 30 to 45 minutes of hard core studying and working. Multiply that by 7 and you get about 4 to 5 hours of homework per night. sure that's not every night but when it is its hard. This leads me in another reason why this extra chore is unnecessary. 
In fact, the cars could worsen the already bad financial situation America faces now. This is because of the following quote from the article. "Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads." "These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical." These direct quotes further express to society that these automated cars require very new, very expensive roads. 
Since the planet is very identical to earth, we are all going to want to explore it. Exploring and studying Venus comes at a cost though, it is a worthy pursuit despite the presentation of it's dangers. 
well that is all i have to say principal.            
It helps when making a decision 
Possibilities range from participating in sports to serving on the student council or helping to create the school yearbook! Students are very likely to find new friends while they participate in these activities and probably even run into some old ones! Having friends in their activity will surely motivate them to do better and achieve their goal! 
The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.                    
second, people that know you well like for an example your family, knows what's right or wrong for you. so you dont have to worry of what they're going to say. Because they know that they wont make you think more. finally, you will hear multiple opinions to hear from. Until you feel that you agree with any opinion. and knowing that it could help you prevent anything that could happen in the future when you need it. 
In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author gaves us many reasons why the experiment would be a worthy but also very risky experiment. Knowing what the people from NASA said about Venus's temperatures and atmosphere would be very risky for the humand they would take to that planet. 
but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways. 
help students build a social life. 
It may well once have been the most earth-like planet that scientists discuss further visits to its surface but the problem is that no spacecraft survived th landingfor more than a few hours. 
To start off this essay I believe having any type of electronic device while you are operating a vehicle is a distraction and can cause wrecks and deaths. 
Meaning it's not that far away to reach. 
In my opinion I believe that students should not do community service for a plethora of ways. 
And some even have lasted longer then they expected. 
we have natural land forms that look like living animals or plants. The likely hood of the face being unatural is very slim. Being that the face had not changed for 25 years, it could mean that this is just a land form that has existed since the planets beginning. 
no teacher wants to grade abstract projects and no student wants to strive for individuality when out of contact with classmates, for when students are on summer break many do not have the ability so see if they are doing the same project, accidentally, as others. 
the electoral  vote caused the 2000 fiasco it was the biggest Election crisis  in a deacades  where  they had to recounnt the stat votes and electors  the system failed to keep count of the votes. 
the process of self exploration is the key to molding successful minds. 
according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them. 
I feel like it should and here's why. 
My only suggestion is to do the votes through the majority voters to the candidate because any kind of setups are not going to work. And the people are not likely going to believe all that stuff. It's kind of hard to do that but, it will going to work.    
This is what i think Lukes point of view for convincing people to come. 
but then again we are 8th grade students and yes we know right from wrong but some students don't mature like others. 
it's unfair to a candidate that wins the popular vote but loss the election 
Educating the youth and next generation may take a drastic change. Distance learning, learning from home, should be a new way of education for students. In online learning, students would learn from home by taking courses online and using videos to educated themselves. Students would no longer be going to classrooms to learn which would actually be a good thing 
to have a topic to the subject 
For example provide a prize for the students that do more community service, that will have students provide more community service then they use to. Also you can give them extra credits for any class, the students will have credit for every day that they provide community service, the credits begin to stock up and the students will have the option to choose any class/subject that they want or need those extra credits for. 
In the article it states"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet." A lot of people believe it is a natural landform but some people think it was put there. Some people think there is life on Mars. Do you think this face is a natural landform or a sign of life on Mars? 
they would allow students to think critically, 
A good arguement was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says "in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would appose John F. Kenedy" that is just evil.  Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made. 
in case of an emergency one of the students can call 911 
First, how does this new technology work 
There was no alien monuments or landforms for the aliens. 
The presidential election process is reduced by the electoral college which proves a clear win. Knowing people who dont care shows the candidates that their votes wont count,and voters in elections are the people who want to express and show political preference rather people think that one vote wont change the fate of the election 
At all basic levels the Electoral collage is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each states, candidates dont spend time in each state they know they have no changes of winning or losing , so they focus only on the tight races. 
Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." 
First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. No one wants to do a project that no one likes. In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project. A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like 
doesw the electoral college work?yes the electoral college works 
you may agree and alot of people will but there will always be someone that wont some people call it the the evening star because its the only thing that will be shining in the sky they dont blevie that its a plante but the people that belive that is a plante often they say "often referred as earth's "twin," venus is the closest plante to earth in term of destny and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too" (pargraph 2). this shows that venus is the closest plante to earth as of looking and sistence. 
So to finalize The "Winner-Takes-All" system is flawed and needs to be either fixed or completly taken down, and here are two reasons why. First a president should be chosen by the people, seeing our county is a democracy meaning that we elect representatives to rule for us, a popular vote fits the sene a bit more than an electoral vote. Secondly if there was every a tie in the electoral college it would catostropic because intead if being in the peoples hand it be in the representatives hands, aslo known as the ones who already have power. 
It could help out in law inforcement 
A state with one representative should not have the equal amount of power as a state with 55. If popular vote is made the way of electing then the odds of a tie would be nearly impossible. 
could be really exspensive, 
so what i think is that technology can't tell show how we feel. 
In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west".     
Therefore Electoral College should be kept instead of Popular vote, because it is time consuming, it is good for big states, and it is less likely of a dispute. Even though this method is not liked by all it is the smartest and most efficient.   
but now we have so much technology people can vote from anywhere they dont have to go put a paper in a box anymore. The system is outdated and unfair to many people. 
You don't always have to give your life up to community service. 
And most people already have a certainty of the outcome of the election, meaning they already know who will win the election based on the number of votes so far in the popular votes section and the electoral section. 
Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage. 
Students would be more likely to want to continue learning by doing their own designed project because they will do it on a subject they want to know more about and intrested in 
You have to try this out 
what is the point of using it when we can just figure it out our selfs 
the electoral vote are very unfair. 
Swing states give America's people a chance to decide an elections outcome. 
Though they have tested many new products in chambler ith simlar climate to venus finding new ways to hopefully find more out about Venus. 
Everytime there are some good positives about the study of Venus there's always something negative following it. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." This a positive input to how to discover some kind of basic of life. " However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only a limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective." This is a barrier in research not being able to get full anwers is going to be hard to discover life. 
It is good for teachers if students make their own project because then teachers don't have to work late coming up with a project. If teachers are forced to work longer to come up with a project then it might not be that good. It won't be a good project because teachers will start to get tired which will result in errors on the project, which is why students should make their own project. students designing their own project will also give teachers extra time to do other things. while the students are coming up with ideas on what the project should be about teachers will have time to grade all the other work the students have. This will also remove the pressure off the teacher because instead of worrying about making a project they will be able to com up with better lesson plans and more fun stuff to do while school is still going on. 
Is describe how the computer can detect on a real face or just on a painted face descrbing of the facial movement were. The muscle of the facial is not expresses their emotion, and also can structure of their face with a smile. By feeling other their emotinos it can also us feel it,as just of creating an emotions. Describing a face is can't lie because of their different muscles, is just telling the truth of your self. It just to communicate between humans and computers with their feeling. 
To wrap up everything about this mysterious face maybe it was created by aliens but we may never know because this face is on a planet where a human would not be able to live and survive to witness the aliens build it. The only people that might have got a chance to witness it is atrounauts that would have been up in space at the time. 
like imagine if we all do it we would be mad at the people who is making us do it no its not you its the bad kids and no wants to mess there day because of them right or wrong well this is what i want to say to you and i hope we don't have to do community service but like if the kids are bad you don't have to put them in community service you cant take stuff away from them . Are they can stay after school and do there homework . 
When I was in 9th and 10th grade, I had to do summer projects all the time. Even though I didn't want to do them, they helped me for the next year so my brain stayed fresh. However, doing it under the teachers rule felt like working in a factory, and it also felt like we weren't learning as much as we were just doing the project. 
All in all, summer projects should be student-designed. 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
one students self innovated project will be different from another, leaving no opportunity to get support from other classmates. 
The Electoral College is a good thing. 
Summer projects need a change and can be by students, 
No,The Face on Mars is just a natural lanform 
When a teacher designs a summer assignment. The content is focused on learning two weeks worth of course related information prior to attending school. Student designed assignments would, in turn, test the intellectual cognition of future students. This would weed out students who may learn come October or November that they do not have the necessary skills to succeed in the class and it is not worth their efforts to continue. Student designed reports would test the readiness of the future students. Furthermore, many AP and advanced classes require students to understand and know how to use the jargon of the classroom. Such vernacular includes contextualization, thesis statement, historical analysis, free-response question, and document based question. Prior to their first day in an AP class, students are widely unfamiliar with the language and testing system of their class and therefore struggle with the tests and essays in practice. Student designed reports would expose future students to this material as well as test the individual's ability to perform at a satisfactory level in the class. 
Have you ever sat in your room and looked at the ceiling for a while and you see a weird shape or face? If you haven't have you ever stared into space and seen a shape or face? Do you think of how it got there, from an alien, your imagination, or natural landform? 
It's more convenient to just hitch a ride from someone such as a friend or a taxi. But sometimes those aren't always the most convenient options. Taxi drivers could take someone anywhere or your friend could be under the influence. Driverless cars are safer because they could take you where you need to go safely. They are also more convenient because sometimes people could be impaired and unable drive, so they would just have a driverless car pick them up instead. This way, it is convenient for people to travel without worrying if they are going to be safe or not. 
Lunch time is also a great time for students 2 use there cell phones 
If the school policy was changed there would not be many students participating in sports or other activities. 
In a lot of schools, students usually have to complete a summer project to continue learning over break. Most of the time, students have to read a certain, designated book and do a handout with it. 
" Sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to venus." "EAch previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." "Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." " A thick natmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus."The suface of venus is over 800 degress, that is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These conditions on Venus are far more extreme. Venus conditions also beat submarines divinging into the deepest parts of out oceans. Ir would liquidfy metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysem even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features just like Earth. The planet has rocky sediment and includes familar features like valleys mountains and craters but, you have to consider given the long time frames of space travel.Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. A cehicle hpvering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. You would have to be 30 plus miles above the surface. The temperture will still be hot around 170 degrees. The air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth. "Radation would not exceed Earths levels." The conditions on Venus would be survable for humans. " Most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering sandard forms of photography and videpgraphy ineffective."" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." "Reaseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance." 
Some say that student designed summer projects are better because they allow the student to pick something that they find interesting and that they understand. 
Through these observations, students would not be able to benefit from online courses 
Students who suffer from social anxiety, or are bullied in school may also benefit from distance learning. 
It make smore sense for the people to have a say and for them to have the ability to vote directly. 
The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others howeveer might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered. 
Should we have a facial action coding system for schools?I do and do not think we should. 
The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). 
In order to make sure that students can actually enjoy their projects, leaving it open to some interpretation can help a diverse set of students come up with individual ideas for their assignment. 
Over the years many people have complained that voting for a president of the united states is unfair. That they fell that someting should be done to change the voting system. In the articals given to me i have read some resons to keep it and to abolish it. In source one the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers astablished it in the constitution as a compromise between elections. For the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
I believed this was unfair because one person could of one but another man had got more "popularity" votes and won. Now tell me why that is fair? 
In situations where summer projects are assigned, projects should be student-designed 
This technology would also create a better living environment across the globe. This is because computers could explain lessons to students in ways a human couldn't. 
I don't care what google does for driverless cars, I think they may be good for a small town such as Berne, but there are a lot of cons to this whole issue. I think it would be fun to have cars we don't have to drive ourselfs but an issue with that is what if we do get into an accidnet in a bigger city. I'm nuetral on this topic because they aren't truly driverless ars if they still need a driver. 
There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. 
Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling. 
Although there just doing the proccess to help peoples everyday lives, but also the proccess is to help other people choose the right prisident and not just because they can talk proffessionaly on a TV screen but to choose the one with a pure heart about helping the people and not just themselves. 
it takes away stress from drivers, 
Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project. 
Not that we are in competition or anything but I am sure SCHOOL_NAME wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school. 
Not all students stay on track with projects however, if it's something they designed students can't say they were not aware of or "didn't know what to do 
That one student who was kicked out of the team because she didn't have the grade B average to play on the sports team is now not accepted by any of her usual friends. She is sad and may become depressed. She used to have so many friends and now she has barely any. They all want to be friends with that new girl, who can maintain the right grade average and can play on the school sports team. Now the old girl feels lonely, no one should ever have to feel lonely because of a grade that kicked them off of the team. That is not the right kind. In a school teachers and principals should aim to have all of their students happy and fulfilled, mostly. 
Getting an opinion from a different point of view, receiving advice from a person with lots of experience, and creating opinions based on your own or others mistakes are all great ways to making better choices.The person could change your mind on the topic, inform you with knowledge that you didn't possess before, or tell you what they did wrong and what not to do.Whatever it is, talking with someone will help you choose, and feel more confident making a decision.Seeking multiple opinions is the best way to help make a better choice.                              
In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service. 
Cell phones are becoming more and more included in our daily lives. From communication, to making and watching videos. They are very essential to us and our day to day schedule. But shouldn't let them ruin our lives either. 
There are many ways to handle situations, but when in need of help you should confide in others for the best advice on how to make a better decision. 
it would allow for the students to make a choice for themselves. 
In education we always have a choice to choose rather we get our education at home or through public and private school but which one is the right choice ? Throughout this essay we will explore the pros and cons on which one is the more beneficial choice. Many kids in life go to public schools since the start of their education life but there are those that choose to get education at home. A child's personality also adds on to what the better choice might be for that certain individual. There are a lot of benefits and non-benefits to having a student attend classes from home. 
can be easily solved by simply giving the presidency to the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, rather than a majority. 
Furthermore, the use of online lessons can be beneficial when it comes to a students forgetfulness. 
From one of there examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions, meaning it is possible to find research. Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating "researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks". 
To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher. 
Seeking multiple opinions help make a better choice 
You also have to think about the people who disagree with changing the system. People can stop voting if they dont like the system. If nobody votes,then are country cant move fourth into the future,and if that happens the USA mint have a civil war. From a diffrent stand point it mint not be a bad thing to get a new system. This is just another reason why we shouldnt change the system of voting. 
Summer assignments are, rightfully so, teacher created assignments 
they could make life long friends that have the same interest. 
It also could make the voice level go down, which will be a relief to the yard duties and other teachers. 
So many people claim alot of things. people will claim that the moonlanding was fake. Wadonna wears a wig eveyrtime time you see her. elvis presely isn't dead. hitler many still be alive today. but we dont know any of these things, you see the idea that we claim things is sometimes true and can be sometimes unrealistic. 
The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the "most Earth-like [planets]" as it "was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life" (Paragraph 4). Venus also "has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability. 
Like for instance The Electoral college is not fair 
An example of this would be when I got invited to two birthday parties on the same day that were almost the same time. One birthday party was for my friend who I had not seen in a little over a month, while while the other birthday party was for my cousin who I saw quite often, but I would feel bad missing his party. I asked three friends whether I should go to my cousin's or my friend's birthday party. Two of my friends said to go to my friend's birthday party and one of my friends said to go to my cousin's birthday party. I decided to go to my friend's birthday party because I hadn't seen her in a while and I missed her. I also decided I would take my cousin out to dinner to celebrate his birthday. I am very glad that I talked to my friends because they helped me make the best choice that was possible. 
and before we have won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now 
I would like to do community service 
In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for theyre president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.           
In our phones we have note pads, calendars, calculators, and other stuff we could use for school. 
How an online class works is that it's held at a certain time every week. During this hour long session the teacher turns on her video cam and goes through a power point teaching us what we need to know for the week. 
Offering distance learning through online classes and video conferencing can help a lot in a student's path of education because it keeps them safe from breakout diseases and increases their productivity by making them more comfortable. The students face far less stress at home than they do at home. This results in a spike of productivity and even makes their grades better. Online classes should definitely be introduced to more schools because it is a really useful tool in helping the student become a better learner and person by teaching discipline and time management skills. 
It helps animals that might not make it otherwise live until they get wherever they are going, then someone can take care of them and make sure that they are okay. 
Already, automakers have created cars that need human assistance when in dangerous situations. These vehicles will provide saftey, comfort, and cleanliness to a world that needs it. Everyone's main goal is to stay safe when they are on the road. With these new vehicles, no one will have to worry about all of the dangers presented today. The cars will brake, accelerate and drive wherever the driver desires. Without all of the stress of long trips, people will be able to rest and be alert for whatever is thrown their way. No one will have to intervene unless absolutely necessary. 
Cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all. 
sports provide any student with what they always need, confidence and exercise. 
the values it has in the schools 
The face that you think is there is just from the land was or an astroid 
Since the voter are not voting directly for their candidate of choise, I personaly dont think this is the best way to go. The popula elections provide a better way of voting for president. Since it means that the people that vote a voating directly to the candidarte and not the electors. 
But really what you should be doing is having study hall for the kids to study before practice every other day for about three week or in till you see some grades go up and if that doesn't work who every isn't doing there work just kick them out of sport in till grades goes up. 
The face is just a natural landform 
I only ask for advice from people I trust such as family, teachers, and my best friend. People you trust and love most likely trust and love you just as much or maybe even more. If they don't want to see you hurt or unsuccessful, they wouldn't give you bad advice. When I need advice, I ask my mom, my grandma, and my best friend. I do this because they all give support to the answers they give me. Also, if it is a "yes or no" question, I can use the majority rules system. 
Im not the only one that thinks this way 
If somebody sees you in the street cleaning, they may be inspired to do the same. Also, you can teach and tutor younger children and give them more knowledge. 
i think for students the academic level for sports should be a B or higher 
Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. 
distance learning help to save your pocket money 
The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. It is very rare that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. 
At first this was a very succesful and popular image, a section from the article states that " The Face On Mars has becoma a pop icon, that starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk show and even haunted stores for 25 years". this states that this photo was a clear sign of Extarestrial life, at least at the time. 
Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would be a great opperatonuty for you. 
The best way to put this is that anything is posiblie you just have to do it, 
One of these cases includes the very recent COVID-19, or corona virus. Distance learning, if implemented, will allow for students to remain at home and hopefully away from the virus while still being able to complete their lessons. Not only will this allow for the students to not fall behind on their school work during this period of time, but it will also allow for the school district to not need to add in extra days to the school year. Other cases in which distance learning can and has been implemented is in cases of students contracting mono, having severe eating disorders, or having some form of anxiety. All of these examples allow for a brief period away from school for students to recover before they are able to return again. 
some students get bored easy and with technology like this it could helo that from happening. 
But assigning this task to students is a great way for them to show their work ethic, 
When a friend, family member or co worker is having a bad day we could use FACS to fix they´er bad day 
So it would be the same as your friend and you pushing them off to do work cause you aint finish all you work so how you gone do sport if you having trouble doing your work . 
You get to explore the vast oceans. 
when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.For somo students is hard to make that decition.But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose. 
There would be a little chance of any human or life to live on venus 
im not sure how may people would buy themi would not like not being in controll of what my car is doing . 
I think we should keep the electoral college 
Like, the Dr. Huang said ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'. But, the computer needs to understand that most communication is nonverbal, like emotional communication. 
because if the public were to vote on who is the new president of the Untied States some people might fight and argure over who's the new president, why he should be their, and a lot of other reasons. The population might think he will be a great guy and a good president, and that everything will turn out ok. Then when they are elected it turns out he might not be such a great president after all, he's probably going to make all the wrong decides and choices for this nation after a becomes president. 
Mona Lisa, she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. Thomas Huang, the beckman institute for advanced science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration of the Unversity of Amsterdam and his colleague are experts at developing better way for human and computer to communicate to each person or online. For computer can use homework research to recognize the subtle facial movement the human use to express how they feel about the computer's using in it. The fact, they perform this same impressive for calculation for every day. Most of them would have trouble their issue of describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried and etc. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a big smile to your face. By the way, making you happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happy to your face. Making faces could be reveal so they have a much of the science of emotions. 
but that was then and this is now. this is coming from the guy who faught for independence and peace...but had over 200 slaves himself,yeah not much of a hero. 
These assignment's should very well be student-assigned. 
help you see multiple outcomes 
If I was working for NASA and l had an argument with a person that believes that ''the face'' was created by aliens, I would say that it is just a simple landform that was made on mars. 
Overall, texting and driving is as worse or maybe even worse than drinking and driving due to everyone having a cell phone and not everyone is at the legal age to drink alcohol. Texting and driving can happen in any part of the day while drinking and driving is usually around night time due to how everyone drinks when it get dark outside. 
allow more flexibility. 
My answer to that is simple "yes 
There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car. 
. If each student was to be part of a club at their school, they would be given access to pursue their hobbies with their classmates 
the air is 97% carbon dioxide, 
You'll make new friends along the way, too! 
The pixels showed clear hard proof, in the one 2001 image spans that are 1.56 meters,and compared 43 meters per pixel in the best and original 11976 photo 
However, online classes can benefit students who have a busy life, are in need of credits, or decide that they want to take classes that interest them 
I feel like the computer and the humans who are trying to communicate with them are a great way to show feelings and emotions through talking. This program is gonna change the world of technology and the world of emotions for the better of the country and it's people. 
how to make our community better place 
This is bad because slate of electors dont speak for everyone. They might like someone that we dont like and give them the power to run for president and probabley win. so this was another reason why the preseident election shouldnt be picked on the electoral collage. 
for example say one student missed the bus and needs to get a ride home but all of his friends are gone and the school is locked. 
if you let them have phones the you will be the most popular and cool principle of all time. 
To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The bookSpeak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do. 
Distance learning can occur through various means and technologies, but the main purpose is the same across the board. The central focus of distance learning is to allow students to learn even when they cannot be physically present at school. Distance learning has been used before for both long and short periods of time including snow storms, illness, or a mental issue. 
some people might have more experience with the sort of situation you are in. 
So more research was done. Scientist took more pictures, which were ten times sharper than the first ones, and stutdied them. Discovering, the obivious, that it was a natural landform.There was dissapointment all over the place, not only for the people, but scientist too. 
Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about. 
you don't have to make them do it only the kids that want to volunteer. 
The Office of the Federal Register writes that "most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate," (Office of the Federal Register 7). This means that the popular vote does determine - for most states anyway - whether or not the candidate recieves all of the electoral votes for that particular state. 
"Making Mona Lisa Smile" in the story the author descrbes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Is this technology to read emotinal expressions of humans wrong? How do they make this technology to read people's emotions? Who's idea was this? 
I believe that keeping the Electoral College is a good idea 
With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. 
The face wasn't stuctured by aliens so therefore was made by natural landform. NASA has plenty of evidence that the Face was form naturally 
In conclusion the software should be implemented in todays classrooms .Althoughyour home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile. 
Making online school a plausible option would also promote better attendance because students wouldn't have to physically be at school to be marked present. 
Phones are fine to use and it's also the best way to come over help. 
hearing several opinions can change our thinking on a certain subject for the better. 
In conclusion, despite how many times people have tried to land rovers and machines on Venus, they will one day find a way to perfect those machines and may be able to send a person up there to gather further research on the planet. 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it won't have any affect on the students, it will cost a lot of money to build, and it will be completely useless. The idea of even having this technology in our schools won't be good for the benefit of our schools and students. 
This comfort breeds and leads to an increase in efficiency due to a student being better able to focus with less of the brain partitioned to ease the stress of being outside of its home. 
While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them. 
Would you like to seek multiple opinion from different people? 
The electotral college doesnt work in my opinion 
the next way would be a bilmp or jet of some kind that would fly over venus at an altutude that is safe for use. 
its always good to hear others opinions. 
Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us 
When using this device you could find out if many students are interested in the activity the teacher is talking about. You could also find out if the are just bored to death that they just want to get up and leave. 
Then our governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment they all so decllare the winning presidential candidate. I think its all just not worth it all that work for what if we could just vote on who we want and the person that gets the most votes wins.  I dont understnd why this have to have all that other stuff that is not needed. 
Driverless cars may be modern and use half of what todays taxis use . Yet they are not truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over in certain conditions , for example pulling in and out of drive ways or driving through road work or accidents. Which brought them to the idea of embedding streets with an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a reciever on the front and end of the car , which is stated in the passage. These smart road systems worked well but require massive upgrades to existiing roads , which is simply too expensive. So with out the smart roads a whole lot of sensors are needed on the car , one specific sensor is the special touch sensor which makes sure that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel at all times . Besides that there is also seats that viberate to alert the driver and flashing lights on the window shields , which would add on to the price of a car. Also stated in the passage that so far none of the cars are completely driverless. They can steer , accelerate and brake themselves but they still notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills . This means the human driver must be alert and ready to take over at all time. Which might not always happen , a driver may not always be attentive of the road ahead even with alerts included in the car. Which brings up the case of a drivers, passengers , and pedestrians saftey , and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with alert drivers , which is stated in the passage. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Infering to why in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. Yet even if traffic laws change , new laws willl be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If an accident were to occur due to the technology failing , who is to blame the driver or the manufacturer. 
I belive that some of the people that do want to become president someday will not become that because their votes mainly deals with the electoral colloges and what they really when the counts of the votes should be really counted off what the people of the united states really think or who they think our president should really be. Some people think we should have a black president or a white president green,purple,or blue it really doesnt matter in my opinion i think i am speaking for everyone when i say that wewant a person that would make great descisions for the umited states a person that is welling to go above and beyond to make our countrymore better and a safe place to all . And at the end of the day people in america doesnt want or think that it is right to have a female president sitting in the seat of a president,i say simply because the people of the USA doesnt think women have enough power or orders, or authority i think women should have the same rights as men. But at the end of the day i think that the people of the united states should have a right to choose who they want to serve as or president , someone who would make change and make the USA a better and safer place for everyone. Someone whois very well educated and have a outlook or reach of things. 
If the electoral vote happened to be a tie then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. of course we would have no control over the vote if that happened so we would just have to accept it. 
Driverless cars are the next step in automotive technology and the research on them should continue because they will be safer and more efficient than cars driven by human drivers. 
We already know that if someone is feeling happy,sad,angry,or fear. 
There are some little things that need to be done to fix it a little like fir example the part thats stats that smaller states have barly no power and that most presedents dont even wory about then becuse they don't make muche of a difrance. 
Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. 
but, what are you going to do after finish it?. 
You can get many compliments on your idea, producing a good feeling that your idea is great. 
in same away lets say there was a camputer or anything that can read mines how would that computer express the feeling in what way 
Some cities are making themselves car-free. Like in Vauban, Germany; Paris; Bogota, Colombia; and even the president of the United States is trying to "curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 29). In Vauban, Germany residents of a community are "going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: the have given up their cars" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 1). 
Most people my age do not understand that they are part of something greater.We would rather be out at the latest movie or shopping for the latest fashions. 
In Conclusion,so today I talked about why we the people need an electoral college and there are many reasons for it. To sum it all up the reasons we need an electoral college is becasue the electors helps us by picking a president,vice president,and the electoral votes that we need. Another is because we have 538 electors that help pick a president. Last is that they give the U.S a president. So this are some of the reasons why we the people need an electoral college.    
Student developed summer projects are integral in a education because it allows students to be more engaged in their learning, create a wide array of skills needed in the workforce, and increase student retention. To this day, I reflect on my AP Biology summer assignment and wonder whether it would have had such a large impact on me if it had been a teacher designed summer project. Based solely on the evidence, I do not believe that the summer assignment would have been beneficial had it been designed by a teacher. For this reason, I encourage teachers across the globe to enforce student designed summer projects in order to create an impact similar to that of my AP Biology teacher.  
Lastly, many school strive to have entertaining activities for students to do with friends. My school does fairs, bake-offs, karaoke, and volleyball scrimmages. We also have an entire week in which students can wear funny outfits that coincide with a theme. It is a way to spend time with friends and try something new. When a student takes classes at home, they are unable to participate in these diverse and exciting events. 
This may reflect student desires, however, it does not reflect what is best for the students education. Summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students because it would be in the students own best interest. 
Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students. 
First of all, computers with this facial coding would be able to help the student using it by detecting any readings of boredom. 
The Electoral College is widely regareded as an anachronish, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. 
but then again that may just be the cheaters. 
In a small conclusion, no cell phones in the school. Kids will make a mess with all that bumping into each other. Finally, the education going on with drop like a bomb. So, please don't make your own hectic sound-track from all the noise. 
the reason that you should have students do community service at a high school is because you can socialize, work, and you can meet different people in the process and make them as friends rather than helping the same person that you already know. 
Foremost, the electoral college is a process used for selecting a president through the popular vote of qualified respesenators. 
Intially, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing presidents 
If anything would ever happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit 
it's important to keep your eyes on the road at all times and to pay attention from crashing or getting crashed into .We have highway patrol and police with speeding guns to prevent crashes people cause by speeding or not paying attention . We also have cameras to catch these things that cause accidents and they work most of the time but doesn't reduce accidents . And checkpoints for people who are under the influence and who are intoxicated and who drunk driving 
Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination. 
The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology makes the very idea of the elctoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system. 
The Facial Action Coding System is the waste of a schools money. 
The apparent solution is that the teachers should be assigning these projects 
I think that students shouldn't be required to do community service because there family might not have time or maybe there parents wont let them. 
For a child it is like punishment to do community service because its taking time out of there own lives to pick up trash. 
The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous 
Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster and you can get responses much quicker than you could with a text message. Reality is one text or call could wreck it all. 
Global survey announced to the public that the Face was a mesa. 
Choosing our president is more complicated than people think it is . One thing that voters do not know when electing presidents is that their vote might not matter as much as they think due to the electoral college . Who is to say electoral votes or better than popular votes ? 
Most people believe the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, a person named Bob Dole, believes that the Electoral College should be completely abolished. 
A project designed by the students would guide them to putting more effort into it 
The Electoral College has many amazing things people like about using it .When it comes to voting not many people do 
it avoids run-off elections 
Even though summer projects are designed to help students and can be done in a number of ways, it is beneficial to have it designed based on the teacher's curriculum and needs. 
This is why i think students shouldn't have to be required to do community service coming from a student stand point. Thank you for reading and i hope you consider my concern 
One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others. 
NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus 
not voting will not effect the election. 
None of the regions have enouough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,  and also gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows he will win in only. It results to just regional apeal and is unlikely going to be a successful president. The residents of other regionds are most likley going to feel like there votes do not count, the new president will have no regards for there intersts, and he is not realy their president. 
you will be able to see many sights, and you do not need to fight in the war 
I believe that community service is the right thing to do 
There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for 
Teenagers lack of motivation would lead to the unproductive reality of online school. 
Teachers in these higher level classes spend a lot of time teaching material to students and never have enough days in the year to teach it all without cramming it down the throats of their pupils, thus creating the need for the summer assignment 
Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes.  
Online learning can be either part time or full time, and thus if a full time online attendance is set in place, it would make attending class that much easier. 
hearing several opinions can narrow down what not to do 
This method has worked for a very long time. 
benifit people by being able to get to places faster 
it has so many flaws 
So those are the some things that the elector candidates say about the whole procces       
English teachers will assign a student a book to read that will have a theme that will be talked about throughout the entire year. Which allows students to be prepared in class and even do better in class because of the knowledge that they have gained by doing the project. Students will already have some insight on what the teacher expects and how they run their classroom based on the summer reading project. 
In the story it talks about a place in idaho that is very similar to the Face. It also says it looks very much like a lava dome. Scientist say a place in Idaho that is called Middle Butte looks very similar to the Face. The pictures the very nice camera took of the Face is proof that they do look alike and that it is just a natural artifact. 
Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those. Finally finish with right thing, Now is fancy work and alot oction to choose in life. 
and it doesn't give them the opportunity to build relationships with former students and their teachers. 
The driverless cars need more modifications 
Some students may say "but, I just don't have time". 
A counter argument could be that some families might be not having a laptop to use for your online courses 
some students don't enjoy public school so taking courses at home is more comfortable for those, 
Luke has this point of view because he thinks the trips were fun on board 
Finally summer projects should be student-designed because students will finally be able to design their project after a school year of teacher-designed projects. 
Im here to tell you all the information you need to see what your opinion of this topic is 
Students would benefit to a great extent if they could take classes online 
I Think The Electoral College is Unfair Because of The Winner-take-all system in each state 
Education is one of the fundamental pillars of a successful democracy and harmonious society. As such, it is of the utmost importance that America's education system be of the highest quality in order to foster the development of intelligent citizens. With the rapid advancement of new technology has come opportunities for new ways to learn; students can type rather than hand write, access internet databases for information, and work collaboratively online rather than in person, among other advantages. It is easy to believe that all the aspects of technology that have been introduced to schools have positively impacted student performances, but an outlier is online learning. 
you would have to vote for a slate if you want to vote for john kerry. not always do the voters control whom their electors vote for. seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all,including rhode island and south carolina. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.the popular vote was really close in florida in 2012.    
So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life. 
Students should be allowed the privilege of designing their own summer projects.Even though teachers assigning work gives structure and stability in the assignments, students designing work can increase their freedom, interest, and comprehension of their education.Also, students will learn responsibility and leadership in the process of creating and following through with their very own assignment.This will help prepare them for future creations, lean off the dependency of a teacher giving them all the work needed for their learning, while allowing the the enjoyment of summer.So let the students lead and help shape their own education.                 
Or maybe for every two hour they do of community service they could get a hour of detention taken off.I think that with my proposition our student will want to participate in our weekly community service program. 
Throughout time, there have been countless sci-fi films and movies of cars that could drive themselves. However, what may once have seemed like fiction is now becoming a reality. Many companies, like Google, General Motors, and BMW have been working on driverless-car technologies since as early as the late 1950's. Although there are many positive sides to these new technologies, many people fail to realize their potentials and feel as if they are dangerous. This, however, is where they are wrong 
You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. So I'm going to leave you with this. What will you choose? The popular vote of the electoral vote? It's up to you not. 
That brings me to my next example, interigation. 
Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher. 
"The classroom computer could recognize when a student is being confused or bored" 
I hear you are trying to make a decision on whether all students should be required to perform community service. 
but because of it's "thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide" or blazin temperatures no space craft or human are able to last on the planet without getting crushed or burned to crisps. Venus atmosperic pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans and living things experience on earth making it impossible for someone to last on the planet, with all of its cons many would rather admire from a view but some would rather get closer. 
Over the summer students are at home and do not have the resources avaliable that are typically exposed to in a school. Without these resources students might not be able to create a project that is teacher designed 
The goal of distance learning is solely to bring out the best learning capability of students. It is provided so that students of different learning paces can have different method options as to which best fits their area of learning. There is something for everyone, whether it be independent teachings, one-on-one time with teachers, or staying in the classroom. Everyone should have the opportunity to test out distance learning and see whether it is the optimal choice for them or not. We all learn at different paces, but it is important to let ourselves grow on different paths than we thought we would.  
Yes, it's an adventure 
Getting advice from mutiple people is a really good idea because not everyone is going to give you all information because their either going to forget about it, not want to say, or don't want to talk about it all the way. 
In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars. While I did have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax. To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I'd be able to use for many years to come. You'll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively. Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life. 
Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents. 
I am righting to you today about about a very important topic, I am here to tell you that 
The students can make it more fun because they know what the enjoy doing over summer or what they would be able to make fun. They would have more of a desire to do it because they made it and because it would be fun and not completely complicated. For example, Generic_Name and her classmates had to do a summer project and their teachers designed the project. Generic_Name and her friends didnt do the project because whenever they got ready to do it together a couple of them got bored with it because it was not fun and the other students did not complete it because it was too complicated for them to do. That is one reason as to why I believe that students should design their own summer projects. 
with all do respect I want to tell you why you shouldn't require all students to perform community service. 
All in all the electoral college should not be kept. Most americans now believe that we are not important and voting is just a waste of time which is currently true and fighting againt the truth is not going anywhere. Loose electoral college or loose active americans.    
The authors last statment about motivating ourselves to go to Venus is striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. Venus's value is worth gaining insight on the planet itself. also out of the human curiosity to know more about the plane. The travels on earth and beyond should be not belimited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagintion and innovation. This is what I think the authors claim is about pursuiting despite the dangers. 
The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the "President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."-Source 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1.The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. "Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators."-Paragrah 2,What Is the Electoral College.Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party. 
Also everything we've worked so hard to achieve will be changed. 
This is called the disaster factor and it happened in the election in the year 1960 when Louisiana elected Democrats to vote against John F. Kennedy, who voted as Republicans against their state and voted forPresident Kennedy, 
Another reason that Venus would be suitable for humaity is because it is the second planet in the solar system and is exposded to a lot of sun light 
In overal the Electoral College has its advantages and disadvantages. It all depends in everyones point of view. People should be treated equally about the decision they made. Let the people be able to choose the president of the United States its a right they have don't take it away from them because it wouldn't be fair to them. We live in a democratic country and the people have the power 
to imform fellow citizens about the advantage of limited car usage.'' as a result,70 percernt of vaubans families do not own car and 57 percent sold a car to move here''.''Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle- families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their home''.and '' passenger car are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive area in the united state''. 
The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. 
You would think it would just be you, the people, but theres actually other people that vote too, called the Electoral college. You help choose your states electors when you vote for your President 
I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. 
It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. 
Voters in certain, dominated areas are supposed to know what they are voting for, yet get nothing to teach them? Not that it matters regardless, since every person within a state supports a political party, right, and, depending on your state's veiw, all Republicans/Democrats have no idea what they are voting for, correct? Like Bradford Plumer says, you shouldn't have to move to Ohio to be able to get a vote. 
students can take interest in their study 
I understand sometimes it could be an emergency 
it aviods run-off elections 
This technology could seriosly improve schools for the better and allow them to forever change how we learn. Students could be individually taught, and they would always learn because the computer would still know if the student is confused or not. This could create worldwide peace because students could fully grasp from histories mistakes and continue to forever make the world a better place.   
This argument can be rebutted, as those who choose online courses would actually have more time to be social 
A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things 
in my opinon i do not think their should be a machine that could read my emotions ever i belive privacy is important and the will for someone to express their emotions to someone whom they may care about is sometimes sacred or personal varying on the person. 
well there are plenty of good reasons. One to save the earth from being turned into a waste land, and knowing that you could help by doing something for your community feels great 
Us as humans drive around town or wherever so much to the point where there is so much gas in the air to kill someone. In the first source it says, " When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Some people don't have enough to afford a car or even pay the monthly payments on them a couple months after they purchase one. 
Just as crisp Autumn air rolling just around the corner and summer is coming to a bitter sweet ending. Then OH NO!You completely forgot about that pesky summer assignment your teacher gave you. You were supposed to read one book every week and write an analysis. This is what its like for every student young or old when given a summer assignment. 
teachers should design the summer work 
Venus will be a great planet to live on. Imagine if you could have a house on earth and one on Venus. 
it'll decrease chances of trafic on express ways 
Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank he became a Seagoing Cowboy! Even himself he said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' He helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. He recovered their food supplies. He went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see. 
In paragraph two it says ¨Often referred to as Earths ¨twin¨, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. 
Some school should offer that because it could help people with anixty. 
Overall abolishing a this from the constitution where its been for too long is wrong. Even though this method is not democratic its still not right to abolish this from the constitution. 
Online conferencing would help students not to get sick by other people. Long distance conferencing would lower their chances of getting sick by others. For example, if students lived in China, where the Corona virus is spreading at, then they would communicate with their teacher online without them catching the virus as well. Online conferencing in today society would play a major role in helping both students and teachers lower their chance of catching colds or diseases. Students would not have to travel long distance to just go to school. With the of online conferencing, students can learn what they need to know at home. For instance, if a girl was pregnant and she didnt have no one to take her to school, then she would just talk to her talk online without the need of her leaving home. With the help of this technological advantage students, who cant find a way to get to school, would be able to learn in school without the need of them leaving their home. With the help of video conferences, the productivity of students' work would go up. This would help students who dont understand the work and what to know more. For example, if students dont understand the assignment they were given, they would be able to learn online with their teacher to better understand. With the help of this learning tool, they are able to learn at a better pace. 
Generic_Name woke up with a churning feeling in her stomach. She still didn't know whether she should cut off her toxic friend Generic_Name or not. She picked up her phone and read the text from Generic_Name. It read, "Hey ugly. You better not wear that hideous green shirt of yours today. I'm wearing my green dress and I don't want people to think we're matching." Generic_Name sighed and just ignored the text. She decided to text her friend Generic_Name, who is also friends with Generic_Name, and ask her what to do. The text read, "Hey Generic_Name, Generic_Name has been really mean to me recently and I dont know if I should stop talking to her or if I'm just being dramatic. Please help." Generic_Name responded, "Stop being so sensitive! Don't ruin the friend group with your petty drama and just let it go." Generic_Name didn't expect this reaction and she still wasn't sure if she should continue being friends with Generic_Name but she didn't really have another option. 
its the ''Evening Star '' and its similar to earth and often referred to as it's twin. 
When flexibility increases, 
In an effort to fight these problems, more than 30 states now have a law when it comes to texting and driving("The Risks of Texting While Driving"). 
community service should not be required in school, 
Thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they know how much work a student can handle 
student designed is better because they should complete assignments.For example, students assigns to work sience projects to help with environment.This shows that students in science class should work together with a group members to complete projects to earn better grades. Clearly, working a group should student designed. Furthermore, student designed is better because they should complete assignments. For instance, students should be productive to complete all summer homework assignments. This proves that students should help with assignments that has classwork questions to work that much stuff. Obviously, completing a assignments should student designed 
I injoy driving and going in and out of plces. 
When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessable locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" supports my statement in the with the sentence, "Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development. 
Im siding for this as it can reveal a persons inner emotions and see if they are suffering on the inside out. 
The Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benifit.  It helps us Americas get a President that will benifit us all not just those in certaint areas.  Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea.  Having swing states, and having a way that finds "everyones" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College. 
An evidence that it says that the author is supporting this idea is in paragraph five. In paragraph it says that " Solor power would be plentiful, and raidiation would not exceed Earth level. Not easy condition, but survivable for humans." 
To start off with, we should not have people we don't know there doing in the congress. 
I was trying to explain that not everyone is the same. You might have the same talent as someone or you may not and thats okay if not. You might want to be the same thing as someone when you get older but someone may want to be the opposite. 
Also keep in mind this is to help paces after World War II. 
Defenders of theNASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." Also part of the reason they even made this picture avalible to the public is to bring attention to mars. " The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars." If they wanted to cover this "Face" on Mars up there would have never been a photo releasead to the public so every one can look at and study. 
Pursuing and expanding our knowledge of venus is beneficial in many ways and can be safely done. 
Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,"Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor." From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, "The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings." If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error. 
then maybe some of the students would pay more attention to the rule and not use their phone during class. 
especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.) 
because it will help us with the voting process.  
If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. 
I can understand why other people may think my claim is wrong, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and should also be entitled to their own vote aswell which is why instead of voteing for someone who will vote for our president [we] the people should directly vote for our candidates. In the same article"The Indfensible Electoral Colledge" 
No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. 
The president should be elected by popular vote only. 
they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble. 
I'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states 
Having fun, making new friends would be amazing. 
or needs help from the teacher when its afraid to ask 
The real fact is that the face on Mars is just a natural landform. 
They are price etc. we need to buy gas,sample of rock. The scientists seeking conduct a through mission to Venus would need personal despite to risks himself it is a danger place. They are such conditions are far more extreme than anything humans on the Earth. As we know that Venus has teh hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closet to our sun. 
In paragrapgh 5, it says, " 
So let's say, you're a democrat living in the state of Texas with the electoral college system in place. You might as well not vote for an elector cause the majority of the people in texas are going to vote for the republican elector. 
You could learn what to do because of something they did wrong, or you could've been the one to make a mistake, and they could tell where you messed up.Let's suppose you went fishing with your dad and put your bait on wrong, causing it to slip off the hook when you cast the line.Your dad could help show what you did wrong, and correct it, because he has made the same mistake before.Learning from mistakes is a great way to improve and have better judgment next time. 
While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. 
But, what about what the children want? 
Other's say that students will not benefit by taking classes from online or video conferencing. 
That will lead to a decreasing number phones being taken away, and also a decreasing number of referrals and detention. 
i also think that if this technology is used people will probably become addicted to it and it will probably start getting on people nerves 
I claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. 
Also, it's illegal to text and drive but people still do it cause they don't think about the consequences or what could happen. 
A teacher- designed project can also better your work 
When you ask for a doctors opinion your asking for your health to make sure that your body is functioning the way its supposed to. Making sure that theres nothing wrong with your body. But when there is something wrong a doctor would usually tell you to take this and you should do this to help your body out a little bit, or if its serious than they will tell you that you should get surgery. 
you have fun with playing with you friends. 
It has too many flaws such as you are voting for a state 
It's easier to read electoral votes 
Nick D' Alto says "Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad." The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. 
Students, due to different commitments, should be able to design their own summer projects. 
do you thing stuudent would benefit from being able to attend classes from hom? 
be more self-reliable. 
The member of the Electoral College are fair and know what is best for the country. The specific Electoral electors for your state vote what the state wants, and is not biased on what other senators or electors want. This gives the people a good amount of say in the election. 
As the years go by,  so does the evolution of automobiles and the effect it carries in our environment. Technology changes the way we move and interact with one another, some for the better and others for the worst. 
being an avid "green" human that is saving the Earth. 
This is a landform not an alien marking. 
The author's claim is supported in this statement because it is a simple solution to technology on Venus. There are very few rebuttals that overcome the postive effects of pursuing Venus. 
The electoral college have to change for good if they dont they wont see any votes when its time to vote 
When it comes to seeking advice, it is always good to look for different sources. It is very valuable to have opinions from other people that a person can lean on. It is common for people to ask others for things from simple, to complicated scenarios. 
Cars and other transportation vehicles are responsible for most of the world polution 
it broadens you're mindset, 
Another interesting thing that they discovered was that Dr. Paul Eckman was the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He had classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It also associated each with characterestic movements of the facial muscles. They invented somethIng else called video imagery, the new emotion software is that they track facial movement 
in my opinion there is no way that it can be safe. 
I vote yes that we should keep the electoral college in. 
A second reason is that it does not disturb or harass or learning environment, so why shouldn't it be aloud? 
One reason why this method should not be used becaus you vote for a slate of electors 
In conclusion if students could attend school online it would solve problems such as, Not living near any schools or any decent schools, students falling ill and being un-able to attend school regularly, And finally If students needed to miss school for family matters. Some might say that having students learn online would encourage them to procrastinate or just skip but not all students are going to just skip school and procrastinate this would actually solve a big problem for many students. In conclusion schools providing online school would solve many more problems than it would create, and it would create new teaching jobs. 
Interpreting this law may cause many conflicts such as making a sport team not do as well 
To start off, Bradford Plumer the author of "The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" states, "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." 
To make this article better, more evidence on why studying venus is benefical should be provided to support their claim. 
Being taught online isin't always a good idea 
First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. 
If this invention coms out permanatly that it can show a poll of how kids view homework and then show how some people view work places 
In conclusion, There are many ways seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinons help because, you can see things in different people's point of view, you can collect and gather peoples opinions and turn them into ideas, and it gives people a chance to show empathy, and be in your shoes. 
By gaining a different viewpoint of the decision, you could notice new pros and cons that you hadn't thought of for each option. At the beginning of this year I was deciding whether or not I wanted to apply for Generic_School. When I was deciding if I wanted to apply, I was mostly thinking about how hard to application process would be. Only really intelligent people get into Generic_School, and I wasn't sure if I had a good enough chance of getting in. I focused mostly on whether or not I was going to make it in, and if the probability of me getting in was worth the effort. When I asked my dad for advice he said "do you even want to go to Generic_School?" He told me that going to Generic_School was really stressful and time consuming, and many of the people there spend almost all of there time studying and doing work. Those were things that I had not considered before. I realized that Generic_School wasn't for me, so I ended up not applying. The different viewpoints that you get, can come from other experiences, and be applied to your own. 
big states 
Some of the students may not feel responsible enough for it and may think he wont do good enough or they will fail the task. 
and im not alone over 60% of voters prefer a direct election instad of what we have now. Now here are the other reasons im against the Electoral College.Fisrt,in the story I read tittled "The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wroung" states that "Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the ALF-CIO wanted to Abolish the Electoral College". Those are only some of the people that want to get rid of the Electoral College.Thats why im with them against theElectoral College. 
Driverless cars could reduce hit and runs 
maintaining a B average can also help you 
I do not belive it is true. I will believe it when I see it. 
because first off we're looking way too deep into our system of voting, is it really necessary too compare our states number of votes with another's just to possibly get noticed? 
As previously stated, teachers will provide students with important information in order to prepare them for the next school year. 
After the presidential election your governor prepares what they call  " Certificate of Ascertainment " , what is that ?  it is listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors it is so important because it shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December year . The Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congres and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election . 
technoloy floods our brain, meaning there is so many inventions it just brainwashes us. We can use photo I.D. now for getting on to our phone. There are mixed emotions when we do show our personality, the techonolgy recognizes it. So we can change everything so someone says, "the facial expressions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang. The mona lisa drawing is suppose to bring a smile to everyones face.So people are still wandering what the mona lisa represents, the mona lisa represents art and beauty. There is a song called mona lisa, and its kinda a love song, saying your my mona lisa baby. So i think the whole idea of this song is to show that the mona lisa is a thing of beauty it represnts more than just beauty.What else does it represent, well does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Do you feel mad or sad. if you felt sad and you were crying and you went to the mirror and looked in the mirror, what would you see in yourself because down deep inside if thing yuo incredibly hurt. Can your lab partner recgonize which emotion you are doing? yes there is a doctor for that. there are so many emotions you dint even know throughout the day. 
No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.  Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win. 
online schooling opens students' eyes to the idea that knowledge is a living, breathing force that surrounds everything and, while incorporating elements of grading and standardization, shifts the focus more onto individual students testing their limits and discovering their abilities fro themselves. 
Distance learning is yet another beneficial example of technology integration in the classroom. Without distance learning as an option students who miss a day have to catch up with the rest of the class by either talking to their teacher individually or getting the materials beforehand for planned absences. This puts extra stress on the students as well as the teachers who have to spend time worrying about individual students. With distance learning, however, teachers can spend more time focusing on the class as a whole and the standards of learning for all of their students. 
InSource two it mentions Bob Dole saying to abolish the electoral collge and most people will agree with that. It's unfair and not right to people that truly care. It also mentions how some states had most of their people voting for someone else that didnt win because the electoral college took over and voted the other way then popular vote." It's the elctors who elect the president not the people." 
i feel we as the people of the united states that are votes should count 
If we try to change IT now we will probally screw every thing up and it will probally be to confusing because of how the world is today. 
The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees. 
there wasting valuable resources in world 
One of the most important features of driving is safety, and the driverless car has been safe. 
I think that driverless cars sound pretty cool. People don't need driverless cars though. 
I closed this section by saying that all computers and scentist can't recongize everybody emotion because everybody is different and experience different test on there emotion 
When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. 
use it when not in the motion of driving 
First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. 
It helps to hear from people who hold different perspectives and beliefs, 
In response to the question of giving students the right to design their own projects, I argue that in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience, the best choice is to give students this ability to design their own projects. In general, these skills will help students prepare for adult life, where they will need the specific skills that are full filed through this project. 
The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast. 
seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. 
Some people should consider themselves lucky because of what happened in 2000 with that fiasco and it was the biggest election crisis in a century. Even though there is 270 votes required to vote for the president, whats fun about that is because there be more  votes and atleast people participate in them. Choosing our president is best because when your voting for the president your voting for state electors 
For example it says in the article "imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For exampe, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow, but if yyou frown, the next ad will be different.'' This shows that you can tell how someone is feeling just based on if they smile or frown. 
As a student myself, I tend to put more effort into my work when I know I can have fun with it. Instead of working on summer project that is picked by a teacher, the idea of picking my own project-design seems more motivating and more enjoyable to work on. When students have the option to work on a project that they can choose from, they end up forgetting that they are working on a project. Instead, they are just having fun and thinking that they are just working on a new summer hobby. The more people that enjoy on what their project is going to be, they are more likely to complete the project faster and not procrastinate on the project. 
Gas prices. Car notes. Parking fines. These are all expensive things you have to pay for when you consider owning a car. 
The Summer Project should be student designed during break. 
Some people can put music or games on their phones to listen to or play during the day. Anti-social students may like using this during break time and lunch time to entertain themselves. 
Why would NASA hide groundbreaking news like this? "Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was anceint civilazation on Mars."So why would NASA hide news like this, that would help advance space exploration? 
The Martian mesa just not had a head it also had a mouth,eyes, and a nose like a real human will have. Since the spacecraft discover it. It came out in books,magazines, and radio talk shows. Some people say that there might be life on Mars. The author engage the public to know and attract attention to Mars. For this disover from the spacecraft and the scientist it was hard work to discover Mars Global. The lava dome that is form like a isolated mesa it is the same height as the Face on Mars. 
one can determine the best method for them self, or to check if something is valid. 
I propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated. This would be a less confusing system that could make voting more efficient.    
The only part that makes sence is that no matter how large of an area or the bias of an area, the electoral college can not be bias 
You might pass a light or someone might be crossing the street and you won't be able to see that person. You're putting others people life in danger. 
While this statement is true it is bias. 
Do you remember the space trip to Mars? Well, another debate is brewing: Should we go to Venus or not? There are two perspectives on this issue. They are the people that want travel Venus (the author), and the people that don't want travel to Venus. There are two inherant issues too. They are the need for futher space exploration, and safety 
Summer projects should be teacher designed and not student designed. 
it will be less problems with people they think if they give up there cars there will be a safer street for everyone 
I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions. 
The author mentions, "More importantly, researchers cannot takes samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." Although this may be a challenge, the author states that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. In paragraph 7, it states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, and that it is possible and worthy of doing so. One project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. "By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces." 
Some students may want to go straight home from school to go eat and take a nap. Also when some students are testing all day they may want to go home and relax. However if the principal forces students to participate in extracurricular activities then they will be even more exhausted by staying after school for the clubs or sports. Some students may not want to stay at school for an extra 1 to 3 hours just for a extracurricular activity. students may have made plans to hang out with friends or go out to the mall. However if they are forced to stay after school then they would have to change their plans. This is another reason why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. 
The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a mordern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." therefore going back to my first paragraph that is why you select people that you trust. 
Now, do you realize why I want the Electoral College gone? We live in a free country with rights to do certain things especially to vote. If we don't really do the voting, then what's the point?   
Thess are my reasions for choosinf the FACS becaues it can help humans in many ways. We could be one step closer to uncovering mystoryes. I like the idea but many people may dissagree becaues they might say that they want to keep things scroit. But like I sead earlyer use the machine if there lying but also sad then you know it is a scorit. So I beleve the FACS should be able to go to anyone that wants it but that is just a thought. 
This is because it was winter in Mars during the time NASA went. 
First and foremost the Electoral College is very old. 
I think this because the face reminds someone of middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. 
There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell yus exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you usae can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart. 
All in all, the author supports the idea of the life on venus and the past with great details that backs it up. Also that the author wants the readers to know that giving up on something will not help you succeed but to keep working on what you are trying to achive to get something great out of it and to figure out how to bypass the obsticals. 
Sometime out can not get your grades all up to passing in time. also i am not good at school but i still try.I think i should get the right to play sport because sports can be job when you get older and it will also keep you in shape just not that but aliened.So based on behavior i think they could not be able to play but just not because of bad grades. 
My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school 
The electoral college consists of 538 electoral. The amendment 23rd gives us ower rights. 
Some people like to play basketball, some like to play hockey, some like to play football. Likewise, students all have different sets of skills and things that they enjoy. Some students may want to do something that is not offered at that school, yet they wouldn't be able to. It doesn't make sense that they should participate in something that they don't enjoy. If a person who does not like to play sports is forced to play an after school sport, that would unfair towards them. Or, if a person who only likes to draw has to take an extracurricular activity, what would they do if there isn't an art club? Making the students do something they would not like or they're not interested in is not very fair. 
Learning advice from school is good because everyone learns and get good grades 
anouther thing that would be cool to see is the world war ll just got over and you could see the boats and all the debre that the world war left behind. 
To feel as if the president is not on your side, i dont imagine that being any fun, that to me would be like rewarding one child and not the other for the same action. 
For example,if they glitching you not going to understanding the lesson she is teaching you.Furthermore,in school would be in a better learning environment then it is to be at home. 
Example; like the elections a President can't be a President with out votes, the country pick their own candidates and the citizens give the vote to the person they pick best for their countryMost likely everything have a vote in our community fuction nothing move with out a vote to people is fair to vote, that how it works  
Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars. 
driveless cars are not safe 
If there were objects in the pictures like an airplane on the ground or an Egyptain style pyramid or even a small shak you could see what they were.    
I agree with the aritcal "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," because it says, "that the electoral college says is unfair, outdated, and irrational." "Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college." 
Over summer break, many students just want to be able to relax and not do work that they may have little interest in that has been assigned by their teacher. By having student-driven projects, it gives students an opportunity to create something that they are passionate about. This is important because when a student is passionate about what they are working on, it creates motivation for them to complete the assignment. A student is highly likely to complete an assignment that they are involved in because it is relative to their life. Many projects that are handed around by teachers have little to no relevance to the lives of students. If students get the opportunity to create their own assignment, they will feel a sense of pride because they are passionate about the topic. This leads to greater motivation internally for any student which leads to better overall results. 
i think that it should stay the way it is because a C is still a passing grade and its hard to focus on 2 things at once 
the Electoral College basically has the final say in who becomes the president of the United States of America. 
When you are in school you feel loved, you gain social skills, and grow relationships. 
Secondly, the united states has billions of people in it, and the electoral college only has a few people in it. You think thats very fair to anybody ??? 
So, you might as well just let the electoral collge do the job. I mean if you want to go and vote mor power to you. But, like I said its a waist of time to do so!!! 
Would our kids be safe to be in the cars? What happens if our kids are playing and the car starts and the kid gets hurt or even dies? 
People are on the argument that NASA would hide an aliean artifact. NASA is trying to cover the possabilty of this artifact being accrute. That NASA would like to have this information to them selfs. The supporters of NASA beleve that NASA would come out with their discoverys. Both sides have a piont of but NASA starts their project to debunk these theorsist. 
I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet? 
If these people have never seen an actual martian how can they say it has the structure of an alien but do not exactly know what it looks like 
i remember one time i got in trouble in school i had to do it i thought it was going to be terrible but after all it really wasn't that bad, i mean it was hard and long but all that worked paid off after it was over my teacher acted like it never did anything wrong because he knew i wasn't that type of child. If i never did my community service i would of have never gotten my respect back for only doing one thing wrong and if you don't have a good relationship with your teacher you will miss out on a lot of fun stuff while your class mates are having all the fun 
Well......no, it won't. Actually, you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform, made by aliens. Yes, there I admit it, sit at home and laugh at the fact that I could be wrong. Look, Mister Whoever reads this for a job, I argue for a living with my friend, and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made. There is actually a chance, somewhere, somehow, a superficially small chance that aliens might have had someplay in this. I know that all sounds crazy, but seriously, think about it. All we have is some lously picture that, while it shows us the exteriror, it doesn't show us anything about the interior of the landform. 
When a voter places there vote they arent voting for the actual president they are simply voting for the reps of the electoral college. "The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast." What this means is that basically the election is based on what they decide not on what the people say 
There are so many ways to lose your life in just a little amount of time. You can be in the car and your and you can be horse playing and you looking back them a car can run into your car then all of you and your friends are dead. This is like something everyone who got their licenses should know, because they had to pass the test to get their licenses. 
in 2000 the U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush wont the election, receiving 271 electoral votes the Gore's 266. If the case of Gore losing the election a year later Bush went to war on Iraq. 
The summer projects should be teacher designed 
Another reason is that it in our constitution 
I personally think that by you changing the school policy it would make it hard for all the people that enjoy sports with a "C" average to even enjoy the activities . I believe that you should not change the school policy because the most kids that enjoy playing academic sports such as Basketball, Track , Cheerleading, Football, soccer ,etc. they wouldn't get a chance to play because the new rule you trying to enforce . I think sports isn't just for everyone with a " B" average it should be for everyone that would like to play as long as the have a good grade point average. 
Again, the popular vote will be more fair.  It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win.  In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes.  
maintaining good grades would help a lot not just to the students but also to the school. 
Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active. 
If more teenagers and adults cared about the people who are around them on the road than wrecks like this would not happen. 
This will allow students to better understand how to exist in the real world and how to work at their future jobs. 
More students need to pay more attention to school so they can be in sports. 
ok I get that truly but when you say oh this person is 83% this and 9% this how can you accuratley say that when emotions aren't calcuated by math no we humans are too complex for that that's why we have people taking care of people not robots caring for people why it's because where made to be complex. That is like saying that weather guy like oh well its gonna be 60% chance of rain and thunderstorm here in the mid east of country no no not it all all because the weather guy only gets stuff right 80%-90% of weather right shoot weather people struggle to predict indiana weather because one season supposed be harsh and deadly potentional winter right while we may have that but like one day it wants be 60 degress fariheit like no its not supposed be that warm in indiana in winter when we think winter we think snow, hail ,snow storms , chilly winds any type extreme colds but warmth no no not at all partly cloudy ok sure some sunshine with cold windchill sure but extreme odd warmth for time of winter no 
If the students wouldn't be able to participate in school sports or activities they are more likely to go and do things out of school, and be involved in something else as well. All the kids like different activities and I think that they should have an opportunity not just study everyday, but also have some fun and do different things to prepare them for their future. 
The author does not support the idea that studyng Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because he or she provides no explanation of facts stated and creates conflicting ideas that cast a grim shadow on travel to Venus. 
Another example that demonstrates my claim is that according to the author, you can see what it is made of 
people are just down right lazy and they need to get up and go exercise, 
Voters get confused 
When you tell a friend about your feeeling by the look on her face. Some people can tell that when you are upset or even more. It depends on the people. Da Vinci stuided human anatomy to help him painy facial muscles precisely enough to have emotions in the paintings. The new softwat stores similar anatomical information as elctronic code. 
Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again. 
Because of this there is not an acurate repisentaion of what the state thinks. 
If each student was doing at least one after-school activity students will be able to show their uniqueness and collectively create a diverse learning experience for everyone at school. 
It can look good on college and job applications. If you wanted to be a teacher, you could go to a local elementary school to read or tutor children of all ages. It tells people that your dedicated to your job. Little things like this can do wonders. 
In conclusion the Electoral College does work but, it all depends the how many people vote in each state and how many the electors decide to vote.         
better for the student because a teacher has considerably more years of experience both learning and teaching effectively. 
Source 2: "Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" states that voters may get confused and vote for someone that they didnt want to vote for. The people should be the ones voting for their president. It is unfair that only the electors get to vote in the end. Voters of the electors cannot even control who the electors vote for. The people have to put their trust in the electors to vote for the president. 
Both professors test's the painting of Mona Lisa of her emotions. Mona Lisa results is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. 
You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you can have many adventures while you are doing the job. If you want to get out into the world this will be a great job for you! 
So you work to experience unique places and things. Also experience adventures and all you have to do is work a little bit. This is the final reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
Students participating in sports and activities helps them take down the stress 
It's illegal to drive with a phone and its multiple why you can't drive without a phone 
Here's what the teachers should do. They show the students a picture of someones face. Lets just say for example Mona Lisa. The students will stare at the picture for about a minute carefully looking at every part of Mona Lisa's face. Then the students will decide Mona Lisa's emotion by rating her happiness, sadness, anger, digust or any other kind of emotions. Then after that the teacher uses the FACS on Mona Lisa's face to see if the results for Mona Lisa's emotions from the technology is the same as the results from the students. 
Many people thought that is was an alien momument, but on April 5, 1998 Mars Globsl Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. A Man named Micheal Malin and his Mars Oribter Camera team wanted to prove that there were no aliens. Him and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos 
you would feel ashame and then many bad things could happen meaning, you would be angry etc. 
Also why does a single reps in Wyoming with 500,00 people have as much say as 55 reps in California with 35 million people? That is just unfair to the voters, 
The use of this technology won't have any affect on the students. 
If a human gets hurt then the emotion and the expression would be squinting there eyes being loud or holding whatever got hurt. 
The software can tell witch muscle is being used. That is how it know if its a fake smile or are a reall smile. 
In America people use automobiles for evryday life. 
But if you do force them they probably learn some thing and when some try new thing they have fun and things like that. 
The article mentioned a very real problem in driverless cars: if something goes awry and someone in injured, who is at fault? These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, "Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved." Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions. 
Even though the traffic laws would be changed, according to the driverless cars there would be new laws put in to cover liability in a situation if there was an accident. 
There are pleny of advantages fellow citizens get for having limited car usage. 
because we dont have enough evidence to prove that they exist. 
it helps those who learn better in a small environment, 
I mean kids do have the strength to go around when the have free time and pick up trash for a local park or maybe as a class field trip go to the beach and pick up all the nasty litter people leave their it would be a win , win situation because in out win we will have a progress to a better earth and better place to live and the other win would have to do with the animals out in the ocean , the would also have ea better home and a cleaner place to live . The already going threw an oil spill i honestly don't think the need any more thing in their water . For an example think to yours self would you like to live in water and other people come and just throw things in your 'home' ? didn't think so , neither do i and neither do they . 
The author is aware of the fact and describes how, "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, "clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers 
Most of the time, when you talk to multiple people you most likely really want an answer to something. Thats why most people go ask others so they can find what cab be the best answer and what makes the most sense. 
people would vote more if their vote could be that single vote that decides who`s president. 
People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club 
there are at least more than 4 million people maybe 5 million in the United States of America. There are more of American people than Democratics and Republicans in the Senate. So actullally we out number all of you slick polictions. 
Should new technology be shut down before it has a chance to prove itself? 
. Even if the conditions at home are completely perfect, a student needs to somehow remain completely focused. A screen with colors and sounds coming out of it does not hold one responsible as well as an in person teacher. 
The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."this quote from source 3 explains that without the Electoral College their vote won't count and that the new president won't have any of their interests. To end this, if we didn't have the Electoral College no one's vote would count 
Being able to attend classes online would greatly convenience thousands of students with little to no time 
The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars 
also if there was a alien life form on Mars we could see it because we have this high packed pixle camera that can take a photo of Mars 
I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes 
Now say if you were shopping at a local convenience store and one day you saw a bunch of money on the floor, you have no idea where it came from but still decided to take some money. Then the next day you think of all the bad outcomes that can happen all because of the money you decided to take secretly, what you could have done to make a better choice was to ask multiple people or at least someone else. Because that way the person could have told you to ask the cashier at the store if they knew someone reported that they lost their money or to just leave it their and maybe the owner of the money could comeback and take back their money. But that still can leave you with a feeling of regret, so what you can do next time is ask someone to give you advice before making an action so you don't end up with a feeling of regret. 
No voters vote a nation election, also in that order about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election. The popular vote was in Florida. Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than some other small states do. Almost some of the voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on a average type of level, and most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. 
If they did have spaceships back in the past we would of already discover it by now. It's probably a alien because it was buried in the ground for so may years that face is actually popping out. They should unburied it to see if it's human or not. If it is they have alot of research to do if not they still have alot have research to do. They should try to see if a body goes with that head. It could be a decovery of a new world 
in the 3 section it shows the number pf votes given to eah state. not ever state gets same number of votes as others some only have couple of votes. to me i thi nk each state shoukld have same amount of vote so its fair .because if all big so then it would be unfair. 
I knew a friend that was in community service in 2009 he now lives in Rosemont, Illinois he picked up trash all over were he lives. But some of the students don't want to do something like this to prevent gases of pollution on earth. 
If I had the choice to home school I would do it. I feel it is a great choice to make. Therefore my stance on this prompt is home school or online classes.              
it reduces likelihood of getting yourself or others sick. 
There is children that may need a group or a friend to talk about their ideas in classes or maybe you have a problem with something and you don't have no one to help you ,and by having not classmate it might be boring being alone. 
I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right. 
It has this ability, because to be a tie both canidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikly. To have a President chossen majority has to vote one way (270). Now with a "winner-takes-all" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beggening of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes. 
In the end it doesn't matter what the citizens want. Who ever gets more votes in the Electoral College, wins presidency. 
students should design summer projects 
These are just a few of the many reasons that students should be required to perform community service for the school. 
Some students could use this software on there computer to use for when they have no one to talk to, to use for homework like instead of looking it up on the internet they could say,"hey computer what is two plus two." 
the author list all of the negitives about Venus of how the temeture is exstreamly hot and how thick the atmosphere is and how the the clouds are filled with highly corrosive acid. despite all of these things about Venus it is still interesting exslpore and to learn about. 
In conclusion, when facing a problem that you want to solve and get rid of, ask more than one person for advice on how to get rid of it.It is important to ask for multiple peoples advice because everyone is different, it can help you form a final decision or opinion and I can relate and confirm through a personal experience on why asking for multiple peoples advice is important.Advice is something we all need, whether we are down or happy, it helps us relate and find a solution for everything.Therefore, multiple peoples opinions will help us make a better choice.                         
When the Author says that technolgy will be your best friends for ching out space and the other plants and get information for you the auther is correct. 
In"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota",byAndrew selsky ,It states that In BOGOTA,Colombia,"It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day without  cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines". It also examines that the turnout was large,despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on bogota."It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"said businessmanCarlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. The without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in bogota in the mid-1990s.In"Paris bans driving due to smog",byRobert Duffer ,examines that,"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city". On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro($31).the same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Diesel fuel was blamed,since France has...[a]tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france,compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe,according to reuters. Paris typically has more smog than othe european capitals. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. 
This Technology would help the real world and should be made. 
Then the House of Representatives would have to vote if that did happen. 
People need to have driverless cars. 
that is one of the rule of school studen must being on the school,and them if the student don't go to the school they will get travel for be missin the school and they will have bad grade 
I would like to keep the Electoral College. I think it would be better for the people. 
Sometimes electronics can malfunction so who's to say that the car will always stop, or that it will always tell you when to slow down. Although it says "driveless cars" the vehicles still require human assistance. Like the passage says "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?" 
The aviods the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes and cast. 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
The president is there to guide and lead the people. The citizens of the U.S should have the right to vote for who they think should be president. For instance,some residents have a feeling that their votes don't count. 
Some may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial, 
because  it is more sufficient and we are used to it. 
Not only does going to physical school help students learn better, but it helps them practice skills that are necessary for life. 
Everyday there's always someone whose severely injured or either worst end up dead because of the use of using their phone while operating a vehicle of any kind. 
I think not, 
The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. We the people of the UUnited states Of America help choose our states electors. After the presidential election our govener prepares a Certificate Of Ascertainment. This cerificate lists all of the canadates who ran for president. 
I hope other schools get inspired by these online classes and give students a chance to try it out, because after all, a students education is what's most important.  
you ahhve a right to vote. you can help choose your state's electors when you vote. because when you vote your actually voting for your canidate's electors to help them out. 
The Facial Action Coding system could be very valuable in classrooms. It has many benefits to both students and educators. It would allow students to remain engaged, learn better, and it would also help educators, A system like this could really allow all students to reach their full potential. 
Every day driving tasks would be handled in a fluid and orgainzed manor. When you are in the car you could truly connect with the people inside. Long trips would turn into exiting family times. There would be no need for all seats of a car facing forward. 
Paragraph 4 said "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal" and that means every you move your expressions change. They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly. They can move and mix emotions in da vinci's masterpiece witch the Mona Lisa useing the FACS. Dr. Huang's new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code. 
Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. 
"Luke heart race as he shot feet first toward and opening on the side of the ship. Luke was happy to beon board, especially when he return trips after the animals had been unloaded. He was happy to be alive, but he coudn't work for a couple of days because of his cracked ribs. 
For everyone else around a driverless car, would always be in great danger. 
A danger to studying this planet is that the surface is hot very hot and normally has a surface temp of 800 degrease Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth making it risky and dangerous. 
In the passage it states that Luke(or I) got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. He also visited an excavated castle in Crete. I also marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I loved it So I know you will. You should also go to help others that need help. 
First,The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotmentof electors equals the numbers of members in it's Congressional delegation:one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators. 
The fact of the matter is that when you look at this mound and you are told its a face you are most likely gonna beleive that concept until you get the scientific facts and you read them and you probably still wont beleive it, because as humans there has always got to be something that drives you to be excited. Its in our genetics and our concept is just going to be stuck with until there is an actual reasoning that can be proven. 
One reason why getting rid of cars could be good is that you wont have to really worry about the greenhouse gases that are emmited by the exhaust pipes 
Because one if you need to text someone because it's an emergency do it at a red light or if you need to tell someone important then just stop somewhere . If you don't do none of the sort you can lead to accident or dealing with the cops. And, you can get in a lot of trouble with dealing with the cops. If you feel like driving and texting is ok then maybe it is to you only if you know what your doing and being safe with those actions. The statistics are very high for teens almost 11 die everyday texting and over 80% of people own cell phones. 
The school board or government shoudnt have to invest in the Facial Action Coding System if teachers take the time and talk to their students 
Many school officials have been questioning whether or not students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities like sports, working on the yearbook, or serving in the student council can contribute a lot to a student's view on school. In addition to this, students will pay more attention to their grades and behavior. 
The gaming club is for people who does not like to play outside don't like getting hurt. You can compete against people in battle games or sport games. Say if you like sports you just dont like playing it in real life only in video games because it seems better to you thats okay. Thats why the gaming club is so cool you can play it on TV instead of in real life. 
It was twenty five years ago. Thar Mars was discovered by a spacecraft it was going around Mars and found a shadow that looked like a human face and it was getting enormous. The head you could found was from two miles from end to end. The face on Mars is found in 41 degress north martian latitude and also it was winter.A few days later there was a change that mars is becoming a pop icon 
Although some may say that teachers should be the ones to design summer projects for their students 
To elaborate, drama, or theater, involves everyone to communicate with each other to create a scene that will dazzle the audience. They must decide how to react, talk, and act to one another to make the performance truly spectacular.Additionally, students don't just see their classmates when they go to their chosen activity, there are other kids from other grades there as well, so it's the perfect chance to meet unfamiliar people, and chat with familiar people, too. To add to that, the activity likely brings out skills in others that you didn't know they had, and that enables students to connect with one another and find out more about each other. 
If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, 
1 the author is trying to explain how does this works,to help the people of the town and especially that if you vote that means that you are helping to the elctors and that probaly wil not help if you dont choose the correct person.       
Teacher-designed projects discourage students from working in such a way that benefits them since they must follow a rubric that limits them. 
Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad 
the certificate of ascertainment declares that the winnig presidential elector in the state ans whows which elector will be represent the state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year 
because many students come late in the school and the teachers sometimes they mark they students are absents or late, but may the school can give the opportunity to who work or to who need it because many student we are working in at the night and sometimes we see many of they students sleep in classes. 
Driverless cars have been the seemingly unattainable, next level of fantastic futuristic technology for many people for decades now. 
Trusting a complete stranger with hands of your future is a difficult task to do. Seeing that most people in possession of power got there using propaganda. Posner believes that "each party selcts a sdlate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."Source 3 Paragraph 16 . How is he completly sure about this? Hitler decieved his people and promised them "better days", and we all know how that went. The Elctoral College process is just not trustworthy. 
Now, say you a new student at a new school. Like anyone else you would like to make new friends. 
because if your from some where with a lot of points your going to win that state. And if you win lots of small states it doesnt matter because someone can win two big states and beat you. Obviously candidates arent going to spend a lot of time in a state they know they have no shot of winning.In 2000 17 states didnt get to see any candidates, because the candidates didnt consider them big states.On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors in the first place? It dopends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the states partys central comitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. 
A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving.    
With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform. 
because it consists the selection of the electors and the electors of where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Based under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President, when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors. 
In the fourth paragraph of the article, the author talks about how Venus may have once been covered in majestic oceans, and most likely able to support numerous forms of life. 
I agree with theElectoral collage and think it should continue with it. I think the president and the congress ahould continue to decide who is the winner they got more expirience and know who will be the best person to continue with it and win theElectoral collage 
The electoral college votes will help the people in the running to become president.             
My position on driverless cars is, that they wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. 
Drverless can be an innovation within our cumminties and cites. These cars could protect more lives and lower the amount of human recklessness that could be done at the wheel of a regular driven car. 
I disagree because students should have sports if their average is a C... 
For example if you live in texas and want to vote for a John Kerry you'd actualy vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry. Who knows if they win the statewide election and go to congress with kerry. And what if "this so called electors" don't even have or hold an public office, who are they in the first place and how do they get picked. Many people congressional men and women want the Eletoral college gone because of the close calls it's had to make and some think those pick favored or didn't favor the country. 
Lastly, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because for some students it is their only option 
The author suggests that studying Venus is dangers 
According to paragraph 8 and 7 not everyone was satisifed with the pictures that the MOC team snapped that were 10 times sharper than the original Vikings photo. When all of the web sufers were waiting for the first image of The Face on Mars it was revealed to be a natural landform with no alien monument after all. 
How the author support his suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents is 
all parents need to get in touch with their children to make sure they made it home safe! 
The author presented many "solutions" to these problems. Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best. 
because this is nice from them they make it for you easy to learning evry thing on the time. 
But the cell phones should be shut off during class to stop distractions. 
Instead of having random members of congress choose the president they can work on serious issues around the world. 
If classes were taken digitally at home, it would be helpful for students because all the class notes would be easily accessible, and disabled and mentally ill students would be more comfortable. Students' academic performances would increase because they would feel more relaxed learning at home and wouldn't be worried about losing class material, since it is all digital. In the near future all the schools you attend may be taking place inside the comfort of your own home. 
A Driverless Car Is Not Able To Go Around Accidents Without A Driver 
The ones who need more help maybe the teacher could send a packet or explain more to them so they can get better at it . 
For friendship you can't find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesn't have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor. 
Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accomodate those who have made this decision by making public transit "free of charge from Friday to Monday," according to the BBC in the articleParis bans driving due to smog . As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.  Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the articleThe End of Car Culture when she includes "recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when "Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work." As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains "In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport." By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor. 
if a reallybad accidnent happen and a hospital was too far away how are we goona help them if we cant find a way to get to one as quicly as possible. cars are one of the best transportation devices so why would you try to get rid of them even if they just cause a little daamge to the earth it really isnt that bad. we really need cars for a whole bunch of things like going to any of your families houses that live  and going to a road trip that might be a couple of hours away , so imagine if you didnt have a car, how would you be able to do any of those with out one. 
We should go with changing to election by popular vote for president 
to see which one had the best advice 
according to "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President." It states that, "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes." This is good because they keep one of the presidents that got the majority of the votes to win automatically,instead they have to do some math to see who the winner is." In the first writing "What Is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Federal Register. This writing says that "Most states have a "winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate." This is basically saying that everyone gets to go the presidential election. 
If kids tried to create a Summer project, it would most likely result in an easy assignment that would take no effort. This would destroy the entire purpose of the summer assignment and give no benefit to the student. But if teachers designed it, then it would more likely be a project of an acceptable rigor. The projects needs to be challenging enough that it keeps kids engaged in learning so they will benefit from it. 
I'm in favor of kipping the Electoral college 
Additionally, even taking into consideration that many school systems now implement technology in the classroom, this is still far less than a consistent full day on the computer required by online courses. By taking an online course, you agree to sacrifice your time and health. 
3. citizens voting on who they want to be president is more rights for us 
Reading faces is not so hard you can see people if they are happy,angry or sad is not so hard if see someone laughing you can tell that the person is happy 
there would be no hands-on-learning within their class lessons, 
on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, 
Not only does students designing their own projects give them a opportunity to pursue their interest, but it also gives them ability to express their ideas in a fashion which they are not pressured and limited by others. 
By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring 
the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday. 
"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"(Duffer, Paragraph 10). "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known os one of the most polluted cities in the world" (Duffer, Paragraph 14). "millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams" (Selsky, Paragraph 20). Also "the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped speadily thereafter.... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 32). And "people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession mat find less reason to resum the habit" (Rosenthal,Paragraph 36). But finally "Mine (19 and 21) have not botheres to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 39). 
Hello, my name is Lisa, and i'm a scientist here at NASA. I have heard that you claim that aliens have created this landform we found on Mars. 
The Electoral College will restore some of the weight in a political balabce that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. 
Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, 
Also you cold become part of a family they could take you in and youk cold have another really close friend from some were far far away from were you live. 
Although some people have very convensing stories as to how that land form got there 
Well the step to take in order to see if a person is showing emotions it would muscular action units. For the instruction 1&2 will determin that techology can tell which from which like a smile canbe tested by a computer or a real person. A machine can tell the difference. 
So those aere the reasons that i would want a use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom that is valuable. 
Secondly, my evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotionl expressions is in the text where it text states " The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thoma Huang, of the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof . Nicu sebe of the university of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate". from this evidence i can definenly defend and give evidence for why i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. from tis quote i am for the value of using tthis technology to read students emotionl expressions because their are many people many universities who combind their knowlege and what they know together so off couse they would come up with something so great. by something so graet i mean humans, technology and emotions. 
These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth. 
Therefore i am a firm believer that it should be popular vote not by electoral college, and if you dont beliee that well you are making the wrong choice and letting other people make the choice up and speek for you. Use your voice. You dont have it for just no reason at all.   
This is why FACS (Facial Action Coding System) CAN be used in a classroom enviroment as well as being succsesful in said enviroment. 
So at the NASA corperation they study the material and the evidence real close.It might be proven to be a land mass or another source of life somewhere else.But for all we know right now it is a landmark until someone has proof it is wrong information. So NASA will keep studying the information they have.Also NASA is trying to develop more information about this landmark. But until then this is known to be a landmark.So until then this meeting is pronounced over. 
Every student is different and every student has a different life they have to maintain. For example, one kid may have to help support their family and is unable to attend school everyday. Even if they wanted to go the school and get an education, they have other things getting in the way. This can hold them back and hurt the education that they need to get to be able to have that steady life and career. If they were able to take an online class, that can work around their schedule, they could help their family out and also maintain an education. This shows that in certain cases online classes are needed and they should be accessible to any student that needs them. 
students are opened up with new knowledge. 
The popular vote doesnt work because when they did it they had one the popular vote but lost the presidency.  
"Venus is the closest planet to eartyh in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too". This might be an advantage for NASA. It might be productive but ithas to be safe too. NASA discribe this trip like "blimp-like"(paragraph 5). NASA is already studying and planing for the trip 
Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you 
My second Example On how Community service is good is by us older grades help out little elementary school kids. 
THE CANIDATES ARE ALL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONE PERSON HAS TO CHOOSE FROM THE CANIDATES HOW IT WILL WORK AND THAT THEY WILL PICK THE ELECTORAL VOTERS TO VOTE AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD VOTE  THEY SELECT A PERSON EVERY FOUR YEARS AND THEY ASSIGN THEM FOR THE ELECTORS THEY ARE OFTEN CHOSE BY CANIDETS  YOU WILL ALSO HELP THEM VOTE BECAUSE THEY VOTE AFTER EVERYONE ELSEAFTER THE PRESIDENT ELECTION THE GOVENER PREPARES THEY WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE ELECTORS THE PRESIDENTS COULD ALSO PICK THEM THEY HOLD OFFICAL RECORDS AS TO WHAT IS BEING VOTED THEY COULD ALSO ARGUE ABOUT IT AND THATS HOW THEY COULD ARGUE ABOUT IT IT WILL ALSO LET THEM SUCCSED IN WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO THE ELECTORS WOULD ALSO BACK UP THE OTHER PEOPLE. SO EACH EVERY FOUR YEARS THEY VOTE AND THEN THEY GET TO SEE WHO WINS.THEY CAN GET 500,000 VOTERS AND THAT GIVES A CHANCE FOR THE PRESIDENTS TO THEY WOULD HAVE 55 REPERSENITIVES TO BACK THEM UP AND GIVE THEM MORE ELECTORAL VOTORS SO THE ELECTORAL VOTERS WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO VOTE AND THAT THE ELECTORAL VOTERS ARE THE VOTERS THAT VOTE AT THE LAST MINUTE AND THAT THEY BACK THE PRESIDENT UP AND GIVE HIM MORE VOTES THAN THE NORMAL VOTER. 
The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle isn't the most ideal or realistic to ensure your safety as well as others safety. 
To begin with, if we get rid of the Electoral College it will encourage more people to vote for Presidident. 
in conclution this story is all about eart and the venus .                                             
a natural landform there was no landform . there was no alien monument after all. 
you also get way more support when asking multiple people because they all want to help out with the decisions you make 
When needing advice due to a problem in life, people often go to someone to ask for advice and they generally go to multiple people to ask advice. For many people this can seem peculiar, going to multiple people for advice might seem point less to some, but when thought about, this method is a helpful way to make a better choice. 
some families may even move out of the school district because of this. 
Obama is the president of the United States. Romney is a republican that went against Obama in the presidential election of 2012. Obama had a plurality against Romney, meaning he recieved more votes than Romney but did not recieve a clear majority of votes. 
In the storis the author said" Beyond high presure and heat, venusian geogoly and weather presentadditional impedimants like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lihgtning strikes to probes seeking to lead on its surface. By comparing, system that use mechenical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other foces". This quotes mean that Venus is despite in danger because it barley causes dager like other planet. 
there are many benifits of doing this act. At the same time there might be some small downsides to going on this trip. 
People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. 
In conclusion, making the right decision is crucial for many aspects in life. Some of these aspects include happiness and success. In order to do that, advice from multiple people is needed. Advice is always beneficial from everyone when it comes to making the right choice. In some situations, advice can be more crucial than others but it is needed in all types of problems. It can be from friends, family, or anyone who could help give reputable advice. When multiple people put forth opinions, new perspectives are provided, decisions are rethought, and new ideas are formed. 
congress should consider the thoughts and opinions that us voters have. If they wish to not do so the candidate with the popular votes could potentially lose presidency. 
Giving student guidelines are very helpful in getting the project done. 
Electoral voting is a voting system that is trash. No one likes it, its not fair for the people to have somone else (The Electors) vote for them. How do we have freedom of speech if were not the one's who are voting? Electoral votes are not what we need if we the people what a good president. 
cars overall have been making people much less active, 
Shouldn't we spend our time and money on something more worthwhile?To me, this concept of driverless cars doesn't make a lot of sense.I don't see the point of owning one of these cars. 
Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. 
I belive that the new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. 
When you are given the opportunity to freely express yourself, it will most likely give you incentive to complete it. This directly connects to allowing students to create their own summer projects because giving students the opportunity to explore something that interests them creates motivation. In addition to that, student-designed projects will ultimately lead to better grades. Having motivation to complete something will make you put more effort into the assignment. 
As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President. This isn't fair to us or the person we want elected.  
Getting opinions from multiple people can greatly impact your decision. 
I believe that community service should be required because no doubt that every teacher wants a self-controlled person in their class, I am not saying that every person will be made to be caring or controlled, but they will know that doing those things do pay off when you look back and think at them. Some studies have also showed that helping out does build a self-made person with respect for themselves and others. This will also make the school look good with all the students who do help to create the community better. 
To me it looks like an Egyptian-style pyramid. I didn't see any aliens in the photograph. There aren't homes where they could live. At first scientists thought that it was a Martian mesa, because that is common around that area. 
One reason they should take down the electoral college is to same money because some of the goverments money  goes to that college that they dont pay for. 
This is true, but not just for student designed projects. Like students, teachers can design different types or styles of projects allowing all types of learning for the student. 
In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the 'thoughtful' voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves. 
it's good for them 
The Electoral College is point less. If the govenment wanted us to vote on the president then why have a college that does that for us? 
Well I really think you should give us a try and see if it works but if it do it could or maybe stay that way. but I really think you should give us students a try and see if we can listen to the rules that u provided to us about our cell phones. and I know some of these students listen and some don't but if u try maybe something will work out for you and us students. 
Teens think it's cool when you drink and smoke and have to driveHome if you are at a party and your friend drank too much and try to drive home Prevent itBefore she/he gets hurts and maybe die from a car crash. 
certainy of outcome 
Reading about venus I have learned a lot, 
. In the eleltoral college they could be a a tie and thru popularity the presendent wins faster and theirs no tie and people dont have to worry about a tie also the electoral collage is unfair to voters because of the winner takes all the system in each state thats not  fair to the voters very unfair.The electoral college has been notice to be unfair also is outdated and irrational the best agrguemnt in favor of the electoral college are mostly assertions with out basis in reality and the arguments against direct election are spurious at best that y people dont whant the electoral collage no more it should  be abolish 
I do agree with the decision of students participating in a extracurricular activity like, sports or working on a specific project or idea. Even working with council members. 
all the sensors you have to put on them. Not just the sensors, but you have to get someone to install the sensors. And if the car malfunctions then the car company will face alot of court issues which also costs alot of money. Spending all this money on making the cars will not be worth it all when people come to complain or get hurt by the car. 
some people need to try new things, becase if we no try new things we can not know to leave they try, because the life its feat of new experiment. 
New Yorks bike sharing policy and a Toll on bridges has greatly decreased driving in it. 
teacher designed projects don't give the students an efficient way of learning 
''Hey, should I wear this or this tomorrow?'' I'm sure we've all had a friend ask us our opinion's on something, like what to wear on the first day of school, but ever wonder why they go and ask others on their perspective as well? 
So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. 
They thought is was made by aliens because they usually don't see this face 
Even so there are students who would love the idea and would go for it. 
Not everyone wants to take the chance of voting for the wrong person to be elected for president. Some voters might get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, as it says in source 2. Most states are small so most people in those states dont think the little states matter and they arent important in the election when they actually do. 
Performing community service can help student get jobs in the future. 
Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a "normal" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids. 
Some scientists are saying that the face up on the moon was not created by aliens because of all the research they have done with and about it 
Futhermore I believe that the use of this technology can be very useful in many ways. 
Dear senator Im arguing in favor of keeping the Electoral collage. It has come to my attencion that people want to change it to election by popular vote for the president of U.S. I think that we should keep the Electoral College 
And the electoral college was founed by the founding fathers, so we know that this thing is really good to use. 
As we all know many people in the United States use phones in their everyday life, either at work or school and even just at home. Our phones are very useful and in my experiences helped me a lot in my time of needs, however many people use it for the wrong reasons. 
theres no trust into the peoples belifes 
with a extra activity it makes no sense for that to happen. the principal would just be wasting his time because it would be nothing anyone likes because noone likes school so why have 1 extra thing that just makes no sense . 
By students designing their own projects they could express emotion through art and color. 
At the end of the artcle, the author finally mentions his viewpoint on the subject.But during the actual article, it is not once mentioned that we should go to Venus. 
Maybe in a college where you want to be a consuler or something along those lines it would be a good thing to have to teach you how to read others emotions better, 
I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished. 
They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone. 
The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it.  I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways. 
I would tell them that the face is not created by aliens because if it was there would be a sign of some sort like there could be possibley more then one of the faces. Also there could have maybe been a symbol of some sort that could tell you or us that it may be out of this world. So studies tell us it isn't a alien monument because well when you look at the picture or image that was taken in 2001. 
Sure, driverless cars sound interesting, but are they worth the risk? With the recent dovelopment of driverless cars, the technology for them is only advancing. 
In that car crash you have to give the poliece your insurance redgerstration ext. When you file the insurance claim whos fault it the accident? Yourself or the car manufacturers? 
Firstly, with technology becomming more popular, an increasing number students are having the ability to learn through technology 
Some states are not getting any votes at all. Also candidates are getting the same amount of votes, but differnent amount of electoral vote. They want to see who gets the most votes to be the president the most electoral votes. People vote so they can have a perference. 
The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft. 
not the people that work as hard as they possibly can all day and barley have their eight hours of rest shouldn't be doing it the "other guys should". 
Some people want the Electoral College because they think that they solve all the problems 
I mean that would be a major issue for the people testing them 
So people might say that getting rid of the electoral college is the way to go because the congress have no say in the voting. The congress is part of the political system and they should be able to have the final say on who is President. 
Knowing their vote will not effect they will have less time to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
Another example is how the electoral college restores some of the weight in political balance, in which large states, population-wise, lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. 
To commence, the Electoral College is pretty much the way the president is elected. 
, choices are important gifts for us to tackle with the input of others. Other people have often been through a similar scenario and have gained knowledge from past experiences to help guide us in the right direction. People tend to lean towards one choice for the wrong reasons, and people forget that their actions affect more people then just themselves. For all these reasons and more, we must seek multiple opinions to make a better choice. 
Students, after a tiring school year, want to relax during their summer break. By allowing students to design the project, they will create it in an uncaring way in order to get it over with. Students will not put the effort in both designing and finishing the project. This will create no benefit, growth, or thought in their education and academics. A personal example revolves around a project my English teacher once gave out. There was no prompt and no requirements other than a works cited. This created a hard time for students to figure out what they needed to do. As seen by this example, allowing students to design their own projects will create no benefit or direction. Without the direction of a teacher, students will not know what or how to do anything that is needed of them. 
It has been brought to my attention as to which method of voting shall be used in future elections. 
If you the Senitor Of Florida take the Electoral College away 538 electors will lose there job and more. The president needs a majority of 270 electoral votes these votes come from the Electoral College. 
I believe that it is a long awaited and necessary change for these summer assignments to become student created and designed, rather than entirely fabricated and mandated by the teachers. It is necessary because not only will it help kids to learn in the different ways that suit and engage them best, but also to help students who have less experience in the subject or who are trying to challenge themselves and find themselves frustrated at the restrictions and requirements of the summer assignment. Added to that, a student driven summer assignment will allow kids to more thoroughly enjoy and become engaged in their learning by allowing them to pursue their passions and interest in relation to that topic, and express themselves through learning in unique ways. 
People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do. 
a lot of people need extra help with other things and making extracurricular activities mandatory is a real big struggle for them and just makes school harder. there are plenty of people dont want to, cant or struggle with them and that's not fair to make them mandatory. Why make things harder for a big group of people just so they will do extracurricular activities. there are students who like them so make them optional. 
Researchers found this figure on the planet mars, they found this not only weird but very interseting. They thought lets do more research to find out what actually caused this formation on mars. Reasearchers thought at first that aliens had put this figure on the planet because it is a figure of a human face. They took big cameras up into mars and sized the figure so large so they could get closer pictures of the image. 
In this essay, I will be going over two reasons as to why talking to more than one person for advice can help you make a better choice, 
Everyone is different and different advice can help you become a better human being. 
Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, "At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). 
When this technology was created it was being tested on the "Mona Lisa Smile". They did a good job making and testing it. The FACS breaks down how the function works in the text it says " The facial expression for each emotion are univeral," observes Dr. Huang,"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"(like not smiling as broadly)". What this means is that it takes detail by detail from facial expressions and trun them into ways of understanding of how people feel in certain situations. 
And so that means that they also have to find out whats wrong with the air and how can they live in it 
This is really cool beacsue you can find out alot of feelings on just a picture. Lets talk about the Mona Lisa , they used this on her and found out how she was feeling in that painting. She was feeling happy for the most part but a little bit of other emotions with that. This is a really cool way to communicate with people, This is also a cool way to make movies and video games better and more reall felling you know.? This can sence 44 muscle in your face and will let you know how your felling just of your expression. 
Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. 
The author suggest Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents and i completly agree with that . But im here to prove why his idea is valuable and correct. 
i'm just saying if the principal does that there will be a lot of complaints for example why do they have to do it and we have stuff to do this is not fare. If all the students will be forced to do something like that they will all be tired the next day because some people are just not used to it like me for example. 
That's much better than having to vote for a president and the electors separately. 
because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president" (source 2). 
because i've been informed that when we vote for our candidate, we are actually voting for our candidate's electors 
because we can better see how hard you work with us. Then we can behave better during school and not be like delinquents all the time. I know your probably having a lot of doubt about this and us as your students should be happy with what ever you decide to do 
If you would make this a requirement for students 
Throughout our life people have been through hardships. Some may be similar situations which include ways it's been dealt with in hopes of others making better choices. With the help of someones past, it can help pave a way for someones decision. Knowing peoples mistakes and consequences can differ what others choose to do. When making a choice some people visit professionals. A few include psychologists, therapists and counselors, they help listen to a problem in hopes of breaking it down and seeking best possible outcomes. These people are there to help drive a path for healthy decision making. Another reason is that knowing other people struggle with things too and that no one is ever alone. It provides at least a little comfort understanding everyone goes through something. Those people who decide to open up about their problems can also help determine a choice. Most people care for the well-being of people in hopes for a successful and enjoyable life 
Getting excersise is extremely important in modern times heart diesease is a major factor in todays society and that can be easily prevented with minutes of excersise everyday .The less you drive the more your bound to walk or ride a bike to your destination 
One other reason why getting multiple opinion is a good idea is because it can make you more educated on the situation that you have 
The question at hand is, "Does the electoral college work?" 
In a physical classroom, the teacher is usually present and is easily accessible, but in an online class, the teacher is not always there when a student needs them; the student would have to rely on sending an email or sending a message through a school-sponsored online chat and wait for a response. The waiting time can range from seconds to hours, or perhaps, days, depending on the teacher's schedule. For example, in the summer, a student may take an online class for economics and personal finance. There would be a time where the student would need to ask a proctor a question about the testing rules, so in that situation, he would email and wait for a response before the test date. However, the student received an email regarding testing rules after the test date. In situations like this, there is uncertainty in determining when the proctor will respond since the student does not know exactly when the proctor is online; but, in a classroom, this scenario would not happen. Because the student is face to face with the teacher, he gets an immediate response. This makes the situation much easier and stress free for the student. 
Its just smarter in general because theres also the kids that will complain about anything and if u just let them choose what ever activity they want to be in they can 
They shouldnt have to vote like that , why have the office men and women vote president? When u could have the citizens of state do it. The office men and women dont know what the citizens want or need. 
the Electoral College is process consists of the selection of the electors ,which the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
Talking to more than one person when seeking advice is a better choice than talking to only one person because you hear other peoples ideas and opinions and you get to choose which one fits you best. 
they said electoral college is unfair,outdated,and irrational. 
and one piece of evidnce that the text gives us about on hot venus is, is " on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fhrenheit" and that shows us that we can learn on how to live on hot planets without buring into a crips also it shows us how far we can go with our air coolers to try to lower the heat. 
Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not.  As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in "What Is the Electoral College".  In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all.  Those candidates went mainly to the "swing" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for.  The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what.  The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state.  In, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", the Romney and Obama election is mentioned.  It brings up the fact that Romney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote.  He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes.  Those who opposed Romney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for Romney.  If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in. 
These are some reason why you should believe me when i said the face is just a landform nothing else not and alien face or an human face. I understand why someone would think this is a alien face because the first picture was not so clear and it did look like a face. 
To start with, because students may need to contact a parent or guardian and the school wont let them use there phone, because they don't think it is important. 
Imagine someone acting to be really happy with a big smile in their face, and then actually being upset about something. The article had a lot of possitive points about this technology. 
There are so many great Amendments that should remain the same. It would be chaos if they changed the Amendments. Plus a lot of people would have even more opinions about why they changed the Electoral College 
Although the electoral college seems unreliable 
The electoral college is unfair because the winner take all system in most states  they do not have any chance in winning. The electoral college is just outdated, and very irrational. We should abolish the electoral college it is a uncompetitive way for competeing for president. Everyone deserves a fair and even chance and by the electoral college is not. 
it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. 
The article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" talks about a boy named Luck who recently graduated high school. Luck worked two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank, when Don Reist Luck's friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat Luck could never said no, because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.To help the European cuntires recover from World War 2,the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to transport the horses,young cows,and mules Luck and Don signed up.Luck and Don received their ordes to repot to New Orleans, they arrived August 14,the day the Pacific War ended. They were headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.Luck had just turned eighteen before they arriving in Greece. By the time he was discharged in '47Luke had made nine trips. To past the time on return trips they would play baseball, volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing boxing ,reading whitting and games also helped to pass the time. 
In paragraph 12 it explains that the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms wich are common around the American West. 
People in science class tries to figher out this girl named " Mona Lisa Smile" while they looking at the picture they loooking how she smiles back but they really think she's really kinda angry at the same time and there is other people doing the same thing but with diffrent painting in schools. There's an expert name Dr. Huang, he developing ways for humans and computers communicate even though it's going to take some years. Until they finally finded out they can calculate emotions like math homwork but working with real humans. 
the struggle of it all was not being able to land any bots on it to adventure and collect evidence of it all. Scientists tried working around it without landing something on it sinse it just gets distroyed while trying to collect data for scientists and hovering something over the planet didnt even work for them. Trying to build a divice to be able to land and last long enough is extremly hard for people for the fact that they have not and cannot land and survive Venus. unable to collect a rock and gas sample make things harder sense they dont know what chemicals are being used against they forces they are trying to take there. 
In another article it explains how the year of"2000 was a fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."There is a exampleAl Gore he won the popular vote but not the presidency .And that majority would have preferred a direct election. Also the electoral voters system voted slate, an example given from the story was if I lived in Texas I would vote for Jonh Kerry, then vote for slate of 34 democratic electorsthat pledged to Kerrry. 
Ladies and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins.   
Abolishment of the Electoral Collage would not give power to all states and, would highten potential for bias political leaders. 
But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that," peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere." 
It would be amazing because as a scientist you should always check for yourself. If you did a previous report on that planet or subject I think you should bring your old evidence and documents out to make things come together to understand better. 
Students know their capabilities. During the summer some schools decide to make teacher give students summer projects, to help keep their mental capabilities up. While students may not like this whole process there has been discussion on whether or not they should be student or teacher designed. 
Now you may be in favor of the Electoral College but sir I'm here to change you mind. Why are so many people in favor of this process maybe because they can guzzle up your money , my moneyOURmoney . I say lets go with popular vote not some elector in a monkey suit. We let them have a "winner-take-all" system as stated in paragraph 7 from an excerpt from " What Is The Electoral College ". Why do we need make the District of Columbia like their own state , why should we go threw all the hassel of putting certain numbers of electors for each state when we can just go with popular vote. The vote we have. 
The electoral college creates an unfair system to gaining votes. 
If it was NASA would be looking for any form of life on my Mars instead of just calling it a natural landform.It was just a landform that was created naturally like the ones on Earth. 
The Electoral College helps with Certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, Swing states,Big staes, Avoid run off elections. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total of numbers of votes are 538 is an even number but it is highly unlikely. The new president will have no regard for their interests,that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the the ones to decide the election. So other being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign tham a samll state does. Voters in a presidential elections are people who want to express a political prefernce rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.            
Later on in life, students will remember the work that they put in, and remember the friendships that they made 
If they use there phones during school it just wouldn't work out, every one would stop paying attention during classes and when the teacher, principle, or staff is talking to them they would not pay attention. 
Some may disagree with what I've had to say but they clearly didn't think about it to much. Also some people really don't care about who gets elected they just don't care nor do they wanna vote at all and most don't. 
I do see this happening in small towns but cities would be more difficult to travel to unless they rebuilt everything within walking distance 
if you still don't believe me I'll tell you some facts 
Since most classrooms are not this dynamic, every student moves on to doing the same thing at the same time. This technology can change up the questions so that an advanced student may move on faster than one who is struggling. Perhaps one of the most important things people need to be aware of in the education system is the student's emotion. Like stated previously, emotions change. So if the computers sees a student with health issues such as depression, it can aid the student in getting help. Parents, teachers, and other school administration need to be aware of the student more than the cost of things. Even with the cost the computer's benefits are easily overshadowing it. 
Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? "of course it will make a diffrence." As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets? 
most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. 
it over rules the poeple vote 
Although we have had the system for so long and it has been reliable and there are ways to fix it some people would still like to move away from it and create a new system. 
It takes the power to choose the goverment officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way 
In Vauban, Germany residents given up their cars to walk the streets. Where we generally park in like parking lots, parking garages, street parking, home driveways, and home garages are all forbidden. In Vauban their streets are completely car-free. They do allowed cars there but some people just want to walk to safe their community. But if you have are car you can only park in two places. Those two places are your house, and large garages at the edge of the development. I would never give up my car to live in Vauban, Germany. In matter of fact 57% of people have sold their cars to live there. To believe or not 70% of Vaubans families do not own cars. To me its hard to think that people actually walk everywhere they go. 
In Conclusion, their is alot of ways to study and some of them are not the same as someoe who wrote it and studying Venus or Mars are very good to study in other planet it because Venus and Mar are the closet planet in Earth. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becuase of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeovers. 
The third reason is the student not doing the program at all. 
For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more. 
Whenever you feel as if you need to ask a question go ahead and ask the question because there is never a bad question to ask because you might be on the verge of creating something new and just don't know it yet. 
Using cell phones between class allows students to communicate with their friends even if they are across the school. It also allows them to contact their family if it is necessary. 
The car can't adapt to driving condtions, so would it be able to avoid things like pot holes and animals that run out in front of cars? 
2. second i think we should keep it beacuse you can tell who voted and not the people that voted 
That's why I think that the electoral college is better it gives certainty of outcome, balances out the big states, and avoids run-off elections. 
because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends 
A reason that I would question about: what about teachers?Would teachers be allowed to have their phones out whenever they wanted?Or can they only have them out if they have some free time?This is all something that could impact the education of the kids, but I'll let you decide that one. 
Fewer people are getting there license and using cars each year anyways. 
To you this might not be interesting but you will read about it everywhere. 
Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called "outdated." But as the saying goes, "If it 'aint broke, don't fix it." 
seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by thinking in a more diverse way. 
it would be very diffucult to do the thing you want to do! 
To begin with, flexible schedules are almost impossible to achieve while continuously attending classes at a desired location every week 
According to the articles and arguements given I think the most effective way to get a premeire president for our nation is vote on the behalf of the Electoral College 
Conclusion for these reason the goverment want to take down the electoral college for the electors. 
It would be fare to other kids if you put " you cant play any sports unless you have a B average or more" 
By taking online courses in the comfort of their own home, students can benefit by feeling more eager to ask all the questions they need to and not feel embarrassed nor, worry about others giving them strange looks. 
students will miss out on many experiences and activities that come along with going to a physical school. 
the care usage limited idea is good 
In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, after days of near-record pollution. 
''Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency , over 60  porcent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. 
When making an important decision, lets say adopting a dog. People would want to ask multiple people if this would be a good idea or not. Adopting a dog is a big choice in someone's life and the person should seriously think this through. For example, lets say the person asks somebody who, in the past, had a dog who would always use the restroom in their house. That person probably would not recommend getting a dog. But then, if you ask a little kid who loves their dog very much and cuddles with it daily, they would recommend a dog. Now what if this individual had only asked the person with the bad dog? This person would now be denied their life time companion and emotional support. This exemplifies why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice. Now what if somebody wants to travel the world and they ask somebody about it. One person hated traveling, they were sick,got a bunch of stuff stolen from them,and got lost. This person hated traveling and would not recommend it to the person wanting to travel. This person had a bad past experience. But what if the person asked another person about traveling. This person absolutely loved traveling. They loved everything from the unique culture, to the flying in airplanes, to trying new things. This person had a good past experience with traveling and would recommend it to the person wanting to travel the world. 
Secondly, If you don't want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference, then I'm sure others feel the same way. 
Because of the winner take-all system in each state,canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. Those are mostly the main reason why the people do not want theEllectoal collage to continue they want to be the one who choose who is winning. 
Yes, it might be dangerous 
With all the technology put into the discovery and creation of driverless cars, there is a going to be an extremely high cost. Sometimes the technologies required to make these vehicles are "simply too expensive to be practical," (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Very few people would be able to afford these cars, so there would be little buyers for the companies. They are using devices that at one point in time "cost two hundred million dollars," (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Companies would end up losing more money than they would gain if they invested in driverless cars. 
but, why be watching t. v when you could go help clean up litter to make a better environment for us. 
One reason why America strives is the fact that we are a democracy, where every one gets a say and we are not ruled by a dictators or communist. The electoral college in no way follows our democratic system, the people are not voting for our president our electors are the ones voting for us. 
Keeping the earth clean but banning cars can make the enviornment a better place. 
In conclusion, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students do not need projects over summer break because students will forget and will become stressed out, students may have other summer actives planned, and all in all students just need a break from learning.I personal feel like students learn enough in the 11 month that they are in school. Summer projects is just something that getting in the way of students having fun and letting loose once in a while.Summer break should be our one time to forget about school for 3 months, lets keep it that way! 
you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
So lets say you was trying to see all of your mom's emotions in one picture, 
Venus is the sister planet to Earth but the surface of Venus presents a challange to any living thing. Venus is also called the "Evening Star" despite it being a planet.Venus is a planet that the most like Earth but we bearly studied it because we'll have to get on the planet to do so. Venus has around the same density and size as the Earth but Venus' surface is 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus' Atmosphere is dangrous as well with 97% of it being carbon dioxide and the clouds made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Many people may be wondering " If our sister planet is so in hospitable, why are scientists even thinking about any further visits? Astronomers are really fascinated by our sister planet because how close to Earth it really is, Venus even has valleys, mountains, and craters just like our Earth.For future visits NASA has came up with an idea to has hover crafth that floats 30 or so miles so we wouldn't have to step on the boiling planet. 
The electon could have a bias opinion and go against what the people want 
Joe and I have different belifes, although I agree with him on this one. Only because, there are already Martin Messas around Cyndonia. But there aren't any like this thats has ever been seen before. I also think that all theses UNmasking face on mars are created by aliens or martins only because, the name Martin Messa. The Martin must come from the word Martian so they must have some typr on relation going on. 
Some may argue that the electoral congress is good because if two canadates get the same amount of popular votes, the Electoral Congress acts as a tie breaker 
The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. 
some say this is far but others believe the "proportional representatin" system, the system that the state governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment", which list all the canidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of there respective electors. 
I always liked the end of the trips because after all the hard work we had fun. We had had so many games. "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling." with all these games we never wanted to leave the sea. If you came too, you could do play too. 
I think that community service is very important and students need to be reminded of that. 
it was made by out founding fathers and should be kept alive 
Having teacher-designed projects is the best option for both teachers and students because it guarantees that students are working hard to meet the requirements of the assignment, comprehending the topic of the project, and working on projects that are both safe and school appropriate. In order for schools to ensure that students continue learning during their break, the most effective project for students to work on, is one designed by teachers.        
Many people forget to do things when it is necessary for them to do it without guidelines or specific criteria they have to meet 
There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don't think much of it, we're being treated unfairly. 
No matter how beneficial cars are to us, wouldn't it be better to limit the use of them? This way if cars usage is limited, then the less problems we face. 
The author does a very good job describing and pin-pointing all of the detailed needed to convience someone to beilve in life on Venus, and support sending probes and eventually humans out to discover Venus. The authors talks about how hard it would be for a mission to Venus to be both safe and productive, but he or she also talks about how much we would gain from it. The author shows how floating in a blimp, 30 miles above the surface would be almost suitable for humans to survive, at 170 degrees. The article says that "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." One day humans will be able to land a spacecraft on Venus long enogh to collect information about the planets past. 
If you are the kind or person who really likes to travel, then you would like to be a SeaGoing Cowboy. You get a chance to be on a boat in the open sea. I would really like to be a SeaGoing Cowboy because your always out at sea and i love the ocean, i could live on the ocean if I could. 
Also because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them .I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/daad get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad . 
As stated in the article, that usually state senators choose the representatives of the state in the Electoral College, if bribery and corruption affect our nations such as those in the Miuddle East, the presidential race can and will be rigged in one party's favor. Due to Mane and Nebraska policy of "proportional representation" could lead to a tie. 
You would receive more than one point of view by doing this and therefor a wider range of ideas. 
Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"that we avoid run-off elections. "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...."The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner. 
Lastly it would be beneficial for NASA to say that it was aliens 
A way that driverless cars can be a negative thing is because people are not in full control of the car. 
"It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. 
Also there is an exact location of where you can find this on Mars which is, "41 degrees north martian latitude." Even though people were not happy about what they saw but at least we know its just a landform with a great creation of the mesa. No aliens can create something like a landform that looks like" it remeinds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain if Idaho", says Garvin. There is a way to remember this and it be the face on Mars or like the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho.             
Everyone thinks differently and has their own perspective on everything. This is why many people have very different ideas and opinions 
because it is very helpful for all students when they need to look up something. They can find everything very quickly, and more easy with using the techonoly. 
In addition to taking the stress off families about transportation, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students are too anxious about going to a public school. 
Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed. 
Venus is like earths twin. The author stated in where the plant is loctaed. Venus tempature on the surface is 800 degrees. NASA is wanting to send people to the planet venus.NASA is wroking on other approachaes to studying Venus. They smiplified electronics that are made up of silicon. They are trying to make the modern day computers even faster then they are today. NASA trying to create a machine that well last long enough to contribute to Venus. Their wanting to make gear that also dont need electronce inquired.People call Venus "The Evening Star" becuase it is one of the brightest spot in the night sky. Although people mistaken it for a star its a planet. Venus is safer to see from the distance its been very challageing to exmane Venus. This planet is the secound planet away from our sun. Venus is the closest size to earth.The NASA is very facinated by Venus because is the most earth like planet. Venus surface is very rocky like valleys and mountains. NASA is request to send some people to go check out the planet Venus but that is nearly impossable . They think that at one point Venus was just coverd inh ocean. Venus is the nearst option to vist. 
being to be able to listen to all perspectives, 
The time have come that we need to see what is out there and see if we can make it happen and try to make a different for everybody. 
I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is not good. Because when parents coming home, they need talking, do something or have a dinner with family. 
Have you ever wondered what people are feeling? well now you can. Their is this new software than can tell you what people are feeling eve tho they are hidding it. Dr. Huang's computer sinces a 3-D model (human musles). it can even read a painting, it want tellwhere your eyebrows should be and where they are and hiw suprised are you in that moment. It can tell you six diffrerent emotions, happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprised, and disgust. 
In conclusion,the electoral college voting system shouldn't be used again in the future becasue of its confusion. It can have you voting for someone pledged to the preisdent that you didn't wan to vote for. It can also be unfair. Many people lost because of this method but won the popular vote. Last it's caused too much problems as a voting system in general.                          
I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made. 
I think that we should keep the Electoral College and let the proffessionals do what they do best. As the people living with what the president has to say I still think it's highly important that we have some say on who the president is. 
The car might face some technical deflicties and someone will most likely get injured. If some dies get injured who will be at fault? wil it be the driver or the manufacturer. I believe it will be the manufacturer because they made the car and they didnt make sure if it was safe for the people to drive arounfd in or not. 
overall the way it is now makes them wotk harder to win the election. 
I hope these essays give you a reason not to touch your phone while driving. 
Yes the planet sounds to good to be true but if that is what we have that is atleast like earth we should give it a try. considering the fact of life on another planet is fascinating 
Without part of your mind (state delegations) all deciding on one thing you would either: try to comprimise by inconvieniocing your party to stopping at 2 restaurants or decide that you all would not eat. 
As a student's perspective I think that the school board shouldn't have any cell phones allowed at all. 
As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher. 
The risk of the driverless car is much greater than the risk of simply driving oneself everywhere. Like taxis, putting your life in someone elses hands is always a greater risk. The driverless taxis just double the chances out wrecks considering that the car still has more kinks than anyone cares to recognize. In the reading, it was stated that the car can brake on it's own. While that could be seen as a convienience, it can also be seen as a danger. The car may brake when it's is not supposed to which could cause a wreck. The driverless cars are still not totally able to navigate through traffic with ease 
it allows easy potential for students to struggle to comprehend material but lack teacher assistance 
In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely. 
There is a big question that goes through a teens mind every time they are told to put there phone away. That question is what is 'What's the point of having a phone if I can't use it?' While it may seem immature and childish it is a legitimate question 
i don't know we like our phone so we maybe want to use our phone anywhere, any day, any time that why u should let us our phones during school time. 
if it was not boring then I am pretty sure everyone would not be as mad as they were. 
In our world today the technolgy is so wonderful it can changes images with the click of a button. 
The resone paragraph nine is so important is that is talkes about the diffrent emotion adds can make us as humans fill. 
not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home. 
So this is a hard choice for you to pick but i would just go by the vote of your students. Plus maybe a lot of kids will choose to do community service and you wouldn't have to make everyone do it 
Should student projects be designed by teachers or students? 
Yes, i know community service is something to better build your character, 
The "Face on Mars" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. 
It all depends on how many votes a person gets. Some may get only one vote and others will get millions of vote it all depends on if they think your good enough to rule your your county. It is very hard for you to make a decsion that big. 
Trust is a big factor in terms of feeling safe. If a person doesn't trust somebody, they're not going to value or put much meaning to what that person tells them. 
The use of this technology to read the emotionl expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
Nowadays when you are walking or even driving you see a lot of people with a smartphone, that's because 61.62% of our population has one. There are a lot of reasons why people are on their cellphones while driving. As well there are pros and cons of driving while texting. 
Many people might still think that mars landform was a sign form aliens and saying that they exist personally I don't think there is aliens in mars or any other planet in our solar system. That was just my idea about it I don't think my statement could be true. Maybe smart kid like a nerd would say " scientists who are studying this kind of martian studies could get results of a real life alien that could be roaming around earth". That's what I would think a nerd would say or maybe he might just say it even smarter than I said it, but that is my opinion I would like to hear about more peoples opinions on the face on mars. Even though many other people will just argue over that it was a face but maybe the aliens destroyed it or just abducted it like they do in boring fake movies of aliens but that's my opinion not you if you don't agree with me it's fine with me.   
When a student is assigned a summer project, their immediate thoughts are almost always negative. This comes with the fact that they do not want to do work over their break, as this is one of the few times out of the year that they're allowed to forget about school for just one moment. Adding to this, if the student is given a teacher-designed project, this puts the motivation to do said project even lower than before. They know that they have no control over how their project turns out, as they often revolve around a fairly black-and-white rubric, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity between each individual's project. 
They can help around the school such as help people work threw there problems. They can go to gideness more and help with them. Oh and this is a big one when the 5th graders come over to tour the middle school. There incharge beacuase there the school councle. All in all i think this would be a fun job that everyone could particpate in. 
if there was an unforgettable moment or something like a cool memory to capture. 
When a person runs for president they are trying to take on the hardest job possible, running a country. When they are on their campaign they visit states individual amd they spen alot of time on swing states or the big states such as California, Florida, and Texas. without the electoral college it kinda defeates the purpose for them spending as much time as they do in those states because yes they have a large amount of people but so does every other state, the only large difference now is the amount of electoral votes each one gets. where as with the electoral college they spend more individualized time with each state to try to sway the majority to get all the electoral votes since they cant split them between the candidates. it all comes down to who the smarter candidate is and how they spend time and what they are trying to achive. 
I think that students should have a choice in this yet I can't help thinking that this would help solve problems, so i am forced to vote for this new rule. 
Maybe their is a student who would love to become involved with children or seniors, they may sign-up to help out at a local church, daycare center, pre-k, or nursing home. 
Students engaging in activities that require a lot of physical activity such as sports, will be more physically fit and most likely healthier than those who do not. If someone decides they want to sign up for yearbook or student council, they will have the opportunity to greatly improve their problem solving skills 
Imagine the following scenario: you wake up in the morning and there is two feet of snow on the ground. You turn on the television and your local news station reports that your school is closed today, so rather than spending a wasteful snow day doing nothing and having to make up seat time later in the year, you log onto your computer and connect with your teachers and classmates via video chat. In many schools in the United States, this situation is quite common. As technology becomes readily available to more and more people, some schools offer the option for students to learn without being at school by way of the Internet. Those who oppose online school argue that technology is harmful to learning and that the best learning environment is the classroom. While it is ideal that the student be in the classroom, sometimes technology is helpful when the student cannot physically attend class 
You should consider doing a extracurricular activity 
I do not think that it is fair to make the Electoral College's votes more important than the citizens of the United States votes 
That right there is why more than what we, humans, are used to. 
The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. 
I also think it could be a punishment for students who misbehave 
Cars have features now that can help or completely park themselves with the use of sensors. Many helpful gadgets that may help if human error occurs and can even prevent collisions 
In the summer, student's minds are in the clouds, and they often forget that they have a summer school project to work on. Of course, this is always a bummer to have, and when students have to start on a project that the teacher has designed for them, it's even worse. Students are more likely to procrastinate, work on the project last minute, and have the mindset of thinking that the project that they have to work on is dumb. The lack of motivation and creativity will end up of making the project not as bright, and rather dull looking, as they struggle working on the project in the summer. However, if a student is able to design their own project, they would be able to put more effort into completing the project and be more creative on how they will complete the project. 
they will be cowboys 
During all of my research i found out that it actually is a landform. 
I like how the techonology work but we need to do the staff for us. 
teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn 
I dont think there will ever be a 100% driverless car i think there will alway be a person with some what controll or should be at all time even in a car that has all the most advanced driverless tecnlogty. i think the need for a humman is needed at all times becaus that tecnlogy wiil fail and if ther is one driverless car on a highway and the human is not in controll and if it was to mess up it could kill a lot of inacent people. but my personal opion is if there are a few driverless cars cool use them at spechel event like the daytona 500,award ceremoneys, in honering someone and things like that..... i think i would be a bad idea to make them avalible to the public for many reasons some being when they mess up how many people will get hurt and when theyn sell them only rich people will be able to afford them because the tecnlogy will be so advanced and cost so munch and the incerence will cost a fortune and when they fail and if they are able to fix them who and how munch will it cost to fix. if people are to lazy to drive them selves then we have a problem 
If they put this into a classroom more kids would want to go to class because it can make class better. 
All of these are valuable assets that will help you later in life, and maybe even help others if they come to you for advice. 
Though students can pick if what and if they want to do the summer project, the assignments being based on the teacher's future teaching plans will allow the student to know upcoming expectations. 
But to lose an husband or an wife a family mmbe an best friend over some stuff like that is really childish and it needs to STOP before it gets out of hand. 
If i had to write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, it would be like this, i would say that it is really valuable 
Have you ever thought what it would be like not having to pay for gas everyday? 
They give us time to do our makeup or call someone. If you did that before you whould get ina car crash. The car basicly detects everything in its way. The car whouldnt always be driving its self u whould need to come in once in awhile. 
Nothing is less safe then a machine that can act on its own, it doesn't require any input from the driver to accelerate or make a turn. Even with all the safety restraints in the world, these cars would still manage to injure or kill people. Artificial Intelligence isn't the same thing as a machine that can act on its own, AI actually thinks about what will happen if they do this or that, machines just do what their told. "Presently, traffic laws are written wih the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times." 
Many kids struggle with a subject that is difficult for them to learn. But we shouldn't punish them for it, just because they don't understand. 
As a result half of the families don't own cars about 50% of them sold there cars 
In the article it says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry somethings or technology cant do that or some people cant do that at all and that is suprsing but what they call it is the "Da Vnci Code" an the name sounds cool and makes seans.Well the whole process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of all faces; all 44 major musals in the model must move like human muscels. Movement of one or more muscels is called an "action unit." Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, Creator of FACS. Eckman has classifed six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles 
Cars are polluting our world everyday and everynight night somebody wants to drive. 
even offering a nuanced opportunity towards the development of valuable time management skills, typical in-school education provides critical social benefits that an isolated, online-based school environment would struggle to provide. 
since students have to study, do their homework, and do their chores all before bed time. Chores is enough, why do city chores the community already volunteers for. 
The electoral college is the most effective way to pick our leaders .    
I know we have it we just done want to release it into the world which makes sense but at the same time we could have billions of people living on 2 differnt planets. Our technology is not quite there yet though, but we're getting somewhere. 
Because of the evidence and reasoning presented, having a physical learning experience is incredibly more beneficial having a learning system online.  
Driverless cars seem like an impossibility.They seem like something out of a futuristic movie or comic book.However, today's evidence proves that driverless cars are a realistic possibility.Advancements in technology today provide tangible evidence that driverless cars could play a prominent role in the near future. 
Only beaucse we have no proof that aliens exsist either. I quit frankly think that this all rubish, but tbis is also my opianion i could be wrong. No one has proof of anything that has happened on mars. 
Because of cars and other vehicles people dont walk or ride bikes ot run anymore because they have a car to take them wherever they want 
students grow up doing what they are told by their parents and teachers. 
students grades, 
Even though it helps the community out by making it a cleaner and safer place the students should have a choice in what they want to do for their community. 
Keep the electors colleges could help the president in the running because the more votes the electors have for that presdient the higher chance he/she will have to win. 
Another point of mine is what if the sensors of the car go out an you have no idea that the car autopilot doesnt work? 
To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning 
There are many things that community service could do for your community. It helps bring new ideas and ways of life, brings more respect, and brings more pride to your town. All these things help your community grow and socialize. They all affect you in many good ways to help everybody. These were just some ideas I was writing to you about making every student do at least some community service. I think it is a great idea and will encourage it all the time. 
So I would have to say that I agree and disagree with your new policy 
The reason why I say this is because when you are in class the teacher is teaching and if you start using it, it's disrespectful. 
without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out. 
it gives students the ability to work at their own pace, 
because it's a fair system in which everybody has a reasonable vote. 
The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,  the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. 
The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. 
many people's mind is still distracted, 
taking online classes are helpful to students who are not able to attend real classes. 
Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air. 
I think all students should do something for the community not just at home, but maybe the school can volunteer and help with the community service. 
f the below B average student goes to his or hers sport practices or meetings they would probably neglect their homework and school work. 
Finally, I think it would be a good idea because the teachers would know how the students are feeling by something they had said or asign. If I was a student, I'd like it cause that would be a good new expreince. 
I think that students would benefit from learning at home 
The other good thing about Eletoral college is that no certain region can win a election so this makes candidates campaign in states that they no they can win. 
The system of Electoral College is one of much controversy as to what to do with it. Keep it or toss it? 'Tis the question. According to an excerpt of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, a Gallup poll taken in 2000, says that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now. 
so I think we should at least vote to it. 
they can eliminate factors that can lead to humans crashing 
In today's society people don't understand what all this pollution is doing to our world and animals.I feel that maybe if we got all the kids in school to participate in this then would could actually make a huge difference, 
In other words going to Venus can be very resourcful and problaly become of use in the future. 
Taking online classes will have some guidance 
As the human race we must stand together united. If not help the homeless help the community littering problem. If not help the problem help the younger children. If we help the younger kids they may go on in life understanding to help you neighbor. 
Most of the times the choices someone will make causes an effect on another thing. When a bad decision is made, this can lead to circumstances that someone would rather stay away from. For example, a person has spent money on something they wanted, but later realize it was bad quality and it was not what they expected it to be. This does not only put them in a place where they have something that is disliked, but now they have also wasted their time and money when that item was bought. Instead, that person should look up that item to see what other people had to say about it or ask peers who have purchased that item their thoughts on it 
Studying venus would be much better. 
Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing 
Like Sometimes When You Get Out Of School And You Have To Tell Your Mom To Pick You Up Or To Tell Her Something Important You Need To Use A Phone But There Is No One To Let You Use It And That Is Why sometimes You Need To Bring A Phone to School. 
Just remember, just because your forced to stop using a car doesnt mean you should give up and quit, just see it as a change in your life and a relief you are helping to make on earth.    
They just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they deside. They will be teach to them. Then, they are start the classes . Some people think it's crazy. When everybody learning they know it's good for everybody. They takeing online or video class for how they are makeing graden? how they are growing up? how they can't do hard work? First issue is how they thing about that? 
So you see that is is easier and less complex to do an electoral vote instead of a popular vote. Thats why i think it is manditory that we keep the electoral collage because it is a more orginized system that prevents some of the problems we see today.                                                                                            
there are many advantages, going through the United States in to Europe. Those are some of the advantages of limiting car usage. 
Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electoral. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Your states Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Voters can expect close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The person who picks the electors in the first place depends on the state 
Many people believe home schooling is a way better option then being at school because it creates more of a comfortable environment for the students 
A lot of people do not have friends or just want to be more social. A way you could do that is by joining the program. After all of the animals are unloaded and you are heading back to your home to pick up more animals, you could play games with some of your ship members. Luke Bomberger got to meet new people and probably made some new friends while on some of those trips, even though he already had a friend that was going with him on the ships and things. 
They might also say they have no point in doing this. 
On the other hand changing to election by popular vote for president will give people a chance to choose there favorite canidate to become the president. 
Imagine this, you find out your mail was robbed. You know that the mail always comes at 2:30 and you saw when the mail man came and dropped it in front of your house. Then you saw two teens walking in front of your house. You might quickly regconise them and quickly call the cops but they wont get arrested on the spot. The police will have to have witnesses,and the teensPoint of View of the storyI always ask my friends what they think about something before making my final answer. 
I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting. 
Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. 
They have spent years learning all about politics so the "most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."(paragraph 20) In paragraph 16 it says "But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.", also meaning that the people we select to represent us is trusted people that will have the same vote as you for the desicion of president. 
Most importantly, the student would get control over their education. 
Although most schools have normal education such as regular classes at school, other schools have something else in mind. Other schools have online classes that students are able to attend. I think the reasoning behind these online classes are because some students may have it difficult at school. 
they are tailored to the unique curriculum the student will be taught with. 
Students stay home from school every day, whether it be from a minor illness or injury or a trip out of town. Obviously, these students are at much less risk of losing their understanding of the material, but absences still require make-up work. Students can miss lessons and lectures, project presentations, and critical study time with their peers that would better their understanding. With distance learning, a student who is well enough to work but contagious to their peers could still present a project, take a test, take notes on a lecture, and engage in class discussions all from home. It is unfair to limit a student's potential learning time based on things that they cannot control, like illnesses or travel. Furthermore, students that travel frequently would also be benefited, as they could work while on the go and review material when they have free time so as not to fall so far behind their classmates. 
When you hear a different perspective of a choice it tells you how the people may have experienced a problem related to yours. You can learn from those past experiences, figure out what went wrong and if nothing did go wrong, then see how you could make it better. It really helps when you know the background of most people's experience related to the topic. You can piece together the information, or write a list of the pros and cons of each perpective and combine all the pros. Finally, when you have your idea of all the perspectives you now know which choice you or others could most benefit from. The choice could now help benefit all kinds of people, since you understand the perspective of all people big and small. 
Please abandon the idea of the electoral collage. thats a childs game. It is not fair game. 
I think that it is a good support the use of this technology to read students emotional expressions. 
I really think you will want to go to that camp with the Cowboys. It will be really great and you get to ride horses and eat amazing food and sleep in a cabin. If you love to camp and go crazy then this is where you need to come. The Seagoing Cowboys. I gerinte you will have fun 
"Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky." Venus is the second planet from our sun. We are curious what venus has and study it. It has so many things that earth dosen't. It's a whole different planet. "NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus." 
I started with a help of my friend because I had no choice. He introduced me after the world war II where people still live in the ruins and are starving. It was a good thing for me back then because I had no hope. And that is how it started. 
the planet's surface is over 800 degrees, obviously not suitable for humans, or any life force for that matter, to survive. Venus has a hotter surface temperature than any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun, due to the atmosphere made up of almsot 97 percent carbon. 
Extracurricular activities are fun. We can play sports after school, join different clubs, or play some games with other students. But we always get to choose what we want to do, right? 
Oh almost forgot you can bring your sleeping bags, tint, pillows, blanking, or whatever, 
The information just from Venus could even help us explore other planets and solar systems far from our solar system 
Secondly, I strongly believe state senator should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it can cause problems in your state. 
Most states have a "winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. This would make would people work harder and strive for higher expectations. The competitiveness level would be even higher becuase everyone is going for the same goal, this would make thing even more exciting to watch and here about. So the Electoral College dose not only just make the system good but it also makes it exciting and competative, which would helpe people want to learn more about the election. Thats another big reason why we should keep Electoral College. 
Because they are well educated in the subject, they are able to create a project that is both relevant and useful to the students education. For example, my AP US History teacher is well knowledgeable about the history of the United States. Before the school year began, she assigned a project in which a student has to portray freedom in a piece of art. By doing this, she is able to connect freedom in history into a project that can create deep thought towards the subject. 
it helps builds creative students 
There were differnt ways they could approach Venus. The 1st way is to basically hotair ballon on Venus and the 2nd way is to just land. Its very challenging but can be done. 
While home-schooling would eliminate the fear of social anxiety, I believe that it is better to face it and get used to it, rather than hide from it. 
Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. 
In conclusion, this feature should be used in all computers. 
Hi my name is Generic_Name and i am going to tell you why people ask you for advice and then ask multiple people for advice 
I think that election by popular vote is  very fair and even. 
If you select the alternative policy, and not the first policy than students would not be allowed to have them of use at school at all 
Some students play sports, and have practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On top of all that, they all have homework, putting required community service projects on top of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics if we have to worry about getting so many things done. 
schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, 
look into the elctoral college. It is obviously the right choice. 
Another reason why the electoral college method is still used today is as stated in source 3 because it restores weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal- appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The electoral colege requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. 
This can cause someone to come home late and not have time for homework. This will cause the student to have a bad grade on his progress report or report card. There can also be times when three different classes all have a major grade assignment due and they were all due at the same date. A player might not be home enough to do the project. They might also have a game that day. If they don't do there homework they wont be able to play, but if they don't come to a game they might get kicked off the team. So having a B average is like trying to win a losing battle for someone on a sports team. 
Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education. Despite the proposed effectiveness this software can serve for marketing companies, Facial Action Coding System would only produce obstacles to a student's learning process, ultimately diminishing any value it could potentially possess in a classroom. 
I think this is a very fair method to use and that we should most definetly keep it. 
Another reason why a person may ask several people for advice is because there are many people who give bad advice. 
because they can not be on their telephone 
The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different," showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children. 
To begin with, the Electoral College is exactly what it sounds like 
it allows them more freedom with the assignment 
All in all, driverless cars are going to be something that will be incredibly helpful in the future. They help to reduce the factors that affect drivers, they will be more a very practical form of transportation, and they seem to be, in general, safer than other vehicles. The advances that have been made in the automobile industry in the last 100 years are truly worthy of our praise. We have come from incredibly basic cars to cars that can drive themselves, for at least some of the time. However, when you look at all the progress that we have made, it forces you to think about what we will come up with next. Maybe, flying cars are not that far away from being a reality. 
In the article it explains how''under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presedent ,but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.''This quote explains that the electoral college has nothing to do with the people the vote is not decided by the people why have any people to begin with.I just think overall you should consider the tip and change the voting rules. 
For an example, Generic_Name wants salad but doesn't know what to put on it. He puts the lettuce shredded cheese and ham on it but he knows he's missing something. He asks his friends to see what they say. One friend asks if he has put tomatoes on it, and another asks if he put croutons on it yet. so with these new ideas at hand, he can now add these items to his salad, and has a salad ready for lunch tomorrow. 
Driverless cars could seem like a good idea sometimes when your lazy becuase you don't have to worry about actually driving the vehicle yourslef. Of course people are going to find a driverless car fascinating, but the most important thing you would want to worry about is safety and having the best functioning technology. Technology can always fail, so no matter how well it may seem to be working, anything could happen at anytime. 
To reiterate, students should be required to perform a community service because it will give them a chance to put their "self love" on low by helping others. The way I see it, students are on one side of the fence, and because they've never left that one side, they have been led to believe that it is all sunshine and rainbows. However, by requiring of them to take the fence down, they will realize that the grass is much greener in the other side. Don't you want to lead your students to greener grasses? 
I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple. 
Summer is fun and special to so many students who currently go to school. School work is dreadful to many, but designing projects does not sound too bad. Designing projects can be fun and a new experience for many. New ways to learn instead of the old traditional boring way can be interesting. Giving students a little freedom would not hurt. Students should be able to decide what they want to do with these projects as it is a great chance for students to discover many new things. 
Life happens. Students go through more than you can imagine. Everyday students deal with the death of loved ones, pregnancies, abuse, sickness. These are things that some adults can barely deal with. As children we are dealing with life's problems for the first time. You can see why that would take a toll on us. Life happens and students go to school and deal with bullying, racism, sexism etc. It is natural that kids who internally struggle with themselves will make others feel small to feel a sense of validation and power. It is not right but that is human nature. However some of our bullies are our very own teachers. A student can be literally be on the verge of suicide and a teacher can give a student a hard time or just be blatantly rude. Teachers are different to students than they are to adults. As an adult you cannot just treat adults any type of way without consequences. Teachers use their power over students to do this because lets be real, as students we can complain and complain and it seems like nothing ever changes because no body truly cares. As much as it is said the actions of those in power do not show it. School is supposed to be a safe space but in reality it is not. There are people who take everything that life gives them and use it as motivation and they thrive. Others are not there yet in life as students are children. The education we are gifted with is a blessing. However sometimes the people in the building are the issue. Going to school for 9 months carrying a child is very hard. Kids can be more brutal than adults. Having the ability to take your classes online at home will benefit so many children in the school system. 
it consist of a presidency election on which who wants to be in office. for instance each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. which electors are choosen by the political party. 
we know that is was now created by aliens 
However it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. 
Do you have a cell phone? It is nice to have, isn't it? You can do so many things with your cell phone like getting on the internet, getting in touch with friends, or keeping track of stuff. Well all these things could help during school 
Designing a project also gives students knowledge in the topic their project is on, as well as skills on how to make projects and other important research based skills that are not focused on in school, but are necessary in higher level education. 
Community service? Try a punishment. And that is exactly what these kids will feel like they're being if you demand that they take place in the community. 
Using your cellphone can actually be deadly 
this is because some people who do not have a lot of time on their hands would go crazy trying to perhaps juggle school projects, homework, out of school jobs that take up most of their day. 
Really though-- all they have are sci-fi movies, fiction novels, and talk-shows-- when we have already proven that it is obviously just an odd formation (that with shadows, angles, and imagination) just looks like a face. After the Mars Global Surveyor flew by Cydonia one day in April, it was completely proven to be just your average land formation. Afterwards, skeptics still were not satisfied, even with the incontroversial evidence that all it was was a rock formation. So, we flew by AGAIN, just to prove that that was all it was 
Sometimes, when someone is really upset or don't want to be rude they can fake a smile that looks so realist. The software update also could follow is the student is bored or not knowing what to do. We honestly need that in all school. Some kids are always disrespectful or always getting in trouble, never doing work 
Make better choice is good for you to be better yourself.If you change your better life will be easy not hard well maybe is hard for to make better decide.  
In my opinions take classes athome can be a good idea,fo the future students. 
What if, during lunch, my friend breaks a bone or gets an asthma attack. There would be no time to call a teacher for help and even if they did come, what would they do for help? Any student's first instinct would be to take out their phone and call 911. Once your done with that, you tell your friend to call a teacher from somewhere so that they can handle the situation. "Whew," you say. "thankfully I had my cell phone." 
We all know how we complain about gas prices, so if you cut back on driving you wont have to worry about gas. 
cars have harmful chemicals, and gases that is bad for the air we breath. 
Online classes can hinder the development of social skills within individuals 
So to start here is a letter to my state senator, in which I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states 
Some classes are altogether impossible to attend online. 
In this paper i have mostly talked about my beleifs, but everyone has their own beleifs and I know that we can not fully prove there is life on other planets, but whatever makes you strive fo answers be my guest. I am not here to judge you or shoot down your answers. I am here to give you once again another concept. 
People seek multiple opinions for many reasons. The ones I mentioned where ones I find important to most people. 
It's not just three or six students that could not fulfil their hours. The whole class would have to study for the test and more that six students have younger siblings that they have to take care of and finally, more that six students participate in sports or other extra curricular activities which means that all of those students could not perform their given community service hours. Since they could not perform their given hours then they would have to face the consequences even though it wasn't the students faults. They had more important things they had to do, not want to do, had to do. 
Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. 
If you help a mentally disabled or physically disabled person that is less fortunate than you understand that you have more than you can ask for while some others don't even have a home, a good brain, or even body parts. If you help the needy and you say to your parents this is nice helping others they'll look at you as a more mature adult knowing that now you know not to take anything for granted and enjoy all the little things. 
my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you. 
With the sports also helps kids get more in shape and gets ther pysical stregth up. Also as we know our population is getting more obeis with sports we can provent that.Altogether with everything thats going on we should help the earth get back into its healthy state by do community services too. 
They would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also. Plus we dont think they would be able to survive on Mars because of the conditions that are there. These aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this. This is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do. 
Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history 
I do believe there should be an option to take some classes online, but one should not receive their whole education through technology. There needs to be hands-on activities present for students to participate in because thats where they can gain life-lasting skills. 
If a computer is able to see our expressions while we are reading articles or doing video surgery, this means that our computers are recording our every move. 
When it comes to something as serious as the fate of our country, citizens cannot put their faith in the such a corrupt system as the Electoral College. 
Texting and driving is very dangerous because during the time you check your phone your brain cells reaction time slows down and it causes a potential accident. 
We the students of tomorrow would love to be able to control summer projects in terms of spreading awareness/ looking at hard topics the public usually avoids. To be inclusive and attention grabbing is the goal and we can push for regulations throughout the school system, a recent matter was opening high school later than usual and getting in the nitty-gritty with financial costs & Bus scheduling. We can and will build each other up on these group projects. In turn we are equipping the mind for the real world we can use steps the we gained form high school and teamwork to get the job done, test scores & graduation rates would be higher due to us engaging in school year round. To close, we can't get anything done without Teamwork and student input, we need to let students have a say in their education to let them be the best the they can be in anything and everything they do.     
Community service is a nice way to helps out . Helping out the community can get you far in life 
The Electoral College can be edited if it needs to though. 
Like there are some places where they don't care how it looks around them and it doesn't look really good. If we could fix this by just say it to go away it would be cool but we cant we have to do something about it. And the solution is to get a group from every student from every school and clean up the nasty thing from the world. And if the student in the school have to do any thing they can wait and get done another time in the time when they finish the work they had to do. 
I want others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program 
According to the studies conducted by the National Safety Council, it was shown that using a cell phone while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year with 390,000 of them resulting in injuries. 
Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 "Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. 
Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. 
So you really cant trust if you are going to end up with the right president. Who is picking the electors anyway? Random people are going to vote for our president. Why should we trust them? 
Students can get benefit from being able to attend class from home 
Many schools recently have prioritized integrating technology in the classroom wherever possible, and have seen the benefits from doing so. 
If not, put down the phone and wait until you are at a light or until you get to your destination. No notifications are worth someone's life or yours. You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people's friends dead because they couldn't wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn't mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead. 
Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. 
Limiting car use could preserve the earth 
Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something. 
Voters in those states pay more attention to the campaign since they are the ones who will decide the outcome. 
I disagree to have the new policy that students may not participate in sports or any other activities unless they have at least a B average grade. 
Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. 
I agree about must participate in one extracurricular activity 
the machine can even track if were angry and how our lips tighten around our mouth 
NASAreleasing it in the hopes while it was coming to public. To sale in stores and area in business ,and it did. Hoping it to be real so we can lead people into the existence of it being real. 
This "face" is just a natural landform. 
I think this could help this school a lot and make kids feel a lot better about themselves. the teachers cold get the kids to go down to lower grades and have them help the younger kids in school and talk to them about how its like in the next couple of years 
Venus might be dangers to go to and explore but by making spacecrafts and more andmakeing experiment it probably would not be so dangerous to send spacecraft or maybe a spaceshit to try it out again. 
You could ask one person for their advice on which outfit you should wear, and they would say one answer, and then you could ask for someone else's opinion on what outfit you should wear, and they could say a completely different answer. However, when you ask multiple people for their opinions, you are getting a much more accurate response. If you were to ask ten people for their advice on which outfit you should wear, and eight people said one outfit and two people said a different outfit, chances are you would wear the outfit that eight people chose. 
Like i said before, students do community service all the time without even knowing they are doing it. Most of the kids that do bad stuff just laugh at the punishments the school gives now. So if they were doing community service it would waste there time and if one of there friends saw them they would be embarrassed. There is the third reason why students shouldn't have to do community service. 
As a high school student i can relate to the lesson getting boring, confusing, or just too fast pace. I feel that if this machine was used to help make an ideal lesson plan for each student the percentage of students passing would increase. I would love to have something as inovative as this technology inside of my schools classrooms. 
As you know the Electoral College is a process, not a place. But do you think many other people know that. They might get a hint 
I believe we should support this because some students just cannot get things as fast as others and they just can't admit it, 
After much research, I have decided that the electoral college should not be kept. 
it also doesnt mean let it get outta hand then try to real it in as soon as possible the only way this would work is if we had some one who didnt care who won eaither way so long as eveything is fair and not messed with. so what im trying to get at is that we dont always get our way but that doesnt mean we need to shut down the Electoral Collage. According to the 23 amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for puposes of Electoral Collage. also Richard nixion and Jimmy Carter Bob Dole have agreed on the electoral collage and there not alone. 
For Example, Here is what Justin Green, Author of fantasy books, had to say when asked about how he learned he liked to write, "Honestly, I first learned about my love of writing when I joined a writing club as a teenager, without that club, I may have never learned about my passion,". This shows that, even adults learned from taking that step, and learned about hobbies that they would have never known about otherwise! Another Example I have is a study made by The West Virginia Sports Association. They asked multiple college sports teams about when and how they gained the interest for the sport. A total of 50% of them said they learned about it through being pushed to take that step, and going out of their comfort zone. This means that, it's not just writing and more smaller hobbies, but sports like soccer and football as well. Showing that even famous people may have been pushed to take the step, and find their passion. 
By doing so, teachers and students are most likely to get along with each other with no issues of any kind. Teachers are more than people who went to school and got their degree, but they are also regualr people just like everyone esle and at a certain point they become like family to us. So it is important for students to make sure they are in good terms with their teacher just in case they need help or guidance from the teachers, they will not get it if they behaved wrongly or cursed at their teachers which is something we often see in schools today. Well, if students and teacher manage to keep a steady and firm bond between one another, no obstacle or problem will come between their relationship, meaning they will be able to work with each other on a daily basis with no problematic concerns from either side. 
As you see it says a comprimise not total dictatorship. Everybody has rights voters rights are being tampered with. freedom to vote doesn't seem neccessary because we may have freedom to vote but our votes isn't making a difference. As Plumer said if there is a chance of a tie " the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president....Because each state cast only one vote ,the single reprsentative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters." 
Did you know every summer students are assigned to summer reading? Students are required to read at least one book or more in order to stay engaged in learning. 
it takes kids education away and kids don't listen to what the teacher is saying 
Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. 
Missing lecture days can be devastating for a student's course grade, however, some schools are implementing an online alternative. Constant access to previous lectures makes learning much easier and by allowing students to take courses online at home, this solution may resolve the previous issues with the school system. While working at home, students will also be able to work in a comfortable working environment with less classroom distractions 
They could make it something they understand and can learn at their own pace while also learning about something they enjoy. They can finally be set free and be given the power and choice to learn a pursuing subject, but also have something that conforms to their personal needs. 
this topic is useful in a lot of ways hostage situations interagations helping disabled people in schools which we all know need help this program could do wonders for people 
Some people don't trust the electorates with this kind of power 
Of course they would be turned off in class as they should. There are so many reasons that we use phones as much as we do and taking them away will cause a tension like no other. The good outweighs the bad in this situation for many reasons and I am prepared to prove that. 
Forcing a student to participate and serve in these extracurricular programs will deter the quality of the programs 
I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. But it is the way our founding fathers made this nation and wanted it to stay that way because they created it that way. 
I think that the electoral college should stay 
the teachers have been educated on student learning 
It would seem very tiring to change the Electoral College. There are so many rules and amendments that they would have to change. They would also have to change the number of votes that the president has to get. I think it would be better if they left the Electoral College the way it is. 
You can become much happier without a car knowing that you don't have to spend all your money on this one item that could break down on you at anything 
So without the Electoral College to make the decision of the President the governer can't make the "Certificate of Ascertainment" the other people and there respected electors won't get noticed for running. 
The most popular vote was in Florida in 2012. Who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. So other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates ina campaign tahn a small state. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the  Electoral College the 301 and 370 electoral votes, repectively. 
,I think you should change the system up 
In the example previous; you could dicide that since you were undicided or the party was undicided, you would not dine.  This could happen; however, the election should operate more on the the principals of the Electoral Collage to prevent this.  In example: "The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."-source 3. 
And you can try to help anyone that needs help you can understand students better when someone has a problem you can try to help them fix it, make things easier with them to support them with thing that can make them happier. Also it can make you just as happy as them because you the one who is helping them to just be kind and nice is the best feelings ever to make someones day can boost your confidence and theirs. 
The Electoral Collage method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.The people needs that the president can have the potential to carry the state. 
This question leads to what is probably the biggest issue with these cars: many developers of driverless cars claim that these vehicles would improve public transportation and, "use half the fuel of today's taxis," but what about the safety of the passengers? A truly driverless car would leave its passengers helpless in the face of an impending accident, and the addition of entertainment systems for part-time drivers would likely not give the drivers enough of a warning to react in the case of an emergency situation. 
Everyone knows the law that says that you can't use your phone while driving. 
I think we should 
Some people would say that it is the heavy cost of a social life to take classes online instead of going to a traditional brick and mortar school. They believe that by taking online classes, people are less equipped in dealing with face-to-face interactions in the real world when the time comes. However, these people also fail to consider that there are flaws in brick and mortar schools which can burden those who prefer an option of taking classes online instead. Although some may believe otherwise 
so if there were objects in the this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even small shacks, you can see what they were!' 
Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spen time in states because they no they have no chance of winning. it's like convincing pigs to vote for you. It's offical the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. 
Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things. In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do. Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, "which paper airplane would fly the farthest." When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given. Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities. 
I believe that they should continue to be improved and developed. 
But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things 
Starting out with the dissadvantages, 
Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. 
Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a "Traffic Jam Assistant" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. 
School shootings have struck fear into many students and have caused them to feel unsafe in schools. Online classes could prevent any of these tragedies from potentially occurring again and students can feel safe again. Students will be in the safety of their own homes and won't have to worry about the about the possibility of any intruders harming them or their peers. The Coronavirus has also fear in many people. People don't want to leave their homes or even travel anymore because of the possibility of obtaining this sickness, and this includes students. Many areas have had people infected with the virus which has caused many outbreaks to cancel schools because students are afraid of getting the Coronavirus. If students attended classes online, they wouldn't have to worry about getting inflected with the Coronavirus. 
Even thought I am with the idea i still have to put myself in their shoes because, some of these kids have seen stuff that I never plan on seeing. 
let's say that I don't feel good or I am angry, but I don't anyone or anybody to know how I feel because I am pretty sure not everyone of us is always ready to let people know how they are feeling, we fake our smile and still smile but we don't really mean it, we smile out side but we feel like crying inside, and most of the time if you come out and say how you are feeling no one will notice it except if you tpld them yourself 
" Attention students, participate in at least one extracurricular activity," said my principal. '"One of these days again?" "I hate this school, we do this every week." Generic_Name why do you like doing this so much?" "Hes letting us play sports, work on the year book, and even have free talking time." Generic_Name said. Out of nowhere,"Generic_Name and Generic_Name come here!"Me and Generic_Name looked at each other and said 'where in trouble' We went to Mr. Generic_Name Office and he asked"are you boys going to do any activity's?' We were shaking harder than ever. "Yes sir "Generic_Name said, Me and Generic_Name headed to the basketball court and there were no ball's, "its Generic_Name" I said, Generic_Name was very mad, "Im done getting bullied by him!" "We have to confront him Cory." "OK lets do it" I said."Are you sure you want to do this Generic_Name?' "Yes I will not getting bullied by him again." We walked up to him, "give us a ball Generic_Name" he laughs "play me for one." "OK two on one." Generic_Name said,"OK nerd" with a smile on his face. Generic_Name gets ball first, game to fiveFirst possession Generic_Name loses the ball I pass to Generic_Name and he hits the three,"score two to zero Generic_Name" i said. " Yeah yeah play ball" Generic_Name hits me for a layup, but Generic_Name was too fast we kept passing back and forth until Generic_Name got tired. A loud noise I heard before I shot, I turned around and seen Generic_Name passed out on the floor. "Generic_Name did we go to hard?" i asked, "No he got what he deserved."Generic_Name saidWe went to Mr. Generic_Name office and told him what happened andI was shocked. He is suspending us for seven days so i said, "I dont like fun Friday Because something bad is always happening just take it out!" "I'm trying to do nice things for the school its better than sitting down and doing work on Frid-" "No its not I will rather do work!" "Generic_Name do you agree with me?" "No" said Generic_Name "I like doing fun Friday better than doing work just like Generic_Name said,you are a nerd." I left the office and went to the bathroom and cried. "Its OK all of us have friendship problems" "Generic_Name is that you?" "Yes, i'm sorry about all them years ago when i bullied you and Generic_Name." i thought thats what a friendship was," in a sad voice. "Can we be friends?" he asked. "Yeah we can" i said with courage.Me and Generic_Name went back to the office and I said my apologies to Mr. Generic_Name and Generic_Name." I guess fun Friday's are not so bad after all." 'I will unsuspend you guy's time, and keep you in school'" said Mr. Generic_Name. 
I really don't see what is wrong with having a phone out during the time we have free. 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
The way students who are taking classes at school it will never become similar to the students who arevtaking classes at home. 
If the vote were solely based on citizen votes, the statisitcal outcome of the event would be crazy. With the majority of the electoral college applying the winner take all approach, it cuts those numbers down incredibly. It is allot easier to confirm a winner out of 538 votes then it is  to confirm one out of hundreds of millions of votes now isn,t it? 
It is easily possible for your eyes to slip off the road. Therefore, instead of your eyes locking in on your phone they should be locked on watching your speed, the road and the traffic. At the same time, while driving your mind can only process so much. In addition, your minds need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Simultaneously, the usage of your phone while driving makes your unaware of the happenings that may occur on the road. Current health teens a recent magazine advises when you aren't on the road there's a great danger of missing something pay attention listen because it only takes a matter of time before you get in a wreck. Concentrating is important while driving and breaking the concentrating cause a risk for an accident if you're on the phone tell that person you are driving and that you will call them back later. 
(pg22). Obama gotten 61.7 percent of the electoral votes while Romney got 51.3 it seems of electors in the electorial college knew what the were doing now my gas prices isnt over 3 dollars a gallon near me  "almost all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-takes -basis"(pg18) not only a predident is just not chosen it is a meeting that takes place where they go throughly to pick the vice prsident or the president. 
Despite the reasons the electoral college is still the unfair, outdated, and irrational system it could be. 
The author explains points in Venus' history that have intrigued astronomers, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelyt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, " (4). Besides having been closer to Earth's "twin" many years ago, Venus may be more similar than humans thought, shown through "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters," (4). Studying Venus could lead to us knowing why this planet is such a far cry from Earth now, and this could provide valuable with how humans interact with their environment. If Venus has such similar features to Earth, like valleys, then there is probably more to discover on Venus' surface. This peculiar connection between this planet and Venus shows how valuable exploration could prove, just as Venus' proximity further supports how worthy of a pursuit Venus is. 
Lastly, it provides an accurate result of who should be president. 
although although teachers can make sure students are doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student designing the summer project. And students can make it more a peeling to one another, it helps builds creative students, and shows your city you are getting your youth involved are just three of many reason. This is why I believe that students are the ones that should design the summer project. 
How could students make a project about a topic that they don't know much about? 
I think students should be required to perform community service. 
you can also experince the work the cownboys used to do. 
Walking makes you healthier, and so will the cleaner air. 
Speaking of safety, the driverless cars all have a safety feature that guarantees almost the maximum safety potential. 
In source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars states that street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely "car free" as stated in the second paragraph. 57% of people sold their car just to move on Vauban's streets. When Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother two said that "when she had a car she was always tense. But is much happier this way."Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in europe. The United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning" stated in paragraph 4. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. When you don't have a car you had to walk to get where you need to go. But when you get a car you dont think about walking because all you wanna do is drive. As stated in paragraph 9, in the United States the Environmental Prtection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.In source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, states that paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the global city. In paris on Mondays motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day. Keeping the air clear is very important. 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to fine. Car traffic was down 6o percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog. All the smog rivaled Beijing and China which is well know as one of the most polluted cities in the world.Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.   
opinions can help represent different point of views, 
This all makes the students and teachers life easier. Summer is mean't to be spent away from school so having to complete a project is more then enough fro the students. If the student has a problem which their project they can just ask their peers or they can ask the teacher. It should not be very difficult for the student and schools should only make this a mandatory projects but not make it take up all of the students summer. Neither do teachers want to be grading a bunch of projects at the beginning of the school year when everything just started again. 
Mental health has been a common topic over the past few years and the conversation around it is thankfully becoming more normalized. School is a huge facor that goes into mental health, and many students do not know when to stop overloading themselves with classes. They can get so caught up in doing well that it can destroy their mental, as well as physcial, health. 
It also shows many people that their lucky not to be living in homeless shelter or begging for food on the streets. It makes them think twice before taking everything for themselves. 
caring for the elderly. 
When having to make a decision its better to see other viewpoints because some people speak from experience to help the person making the choice. Some people give their opinions based off of what they think would be better for yourself and your future. Lastly, some people may give pros and cons of each choice to help the person making the decision. 
You can't forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you. 
Third, according to the Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now 
I am however, not in favor of keeping the Electoral College but to change it to be an election by popular vote for the president of the United States 
Well first off, i dont really care if they are made or not, it's not my money or time being invested or devoted into them. Now i wouldnt say they are a good idea, but i will say i think they are a really cool project and concept, and i do and know they are out there. 
The best arguments in favor is the popular vote, but some canidates still lose from the presidency. 
On the other hand is how do we know this. 
If you are doing community services your helping do better thing for your communtiy before its too late. 
Richard A. Posner reason 1:Certainty Of  OutcomeDispute over  the out come is possible-it happend in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute between popular vote. the reson is that winnning candidate's share of electoral collage invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote.reason 2:Everyone's PresidentThe electoral college  requirs canadates to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional such as Mitt Romneywas in the south,has so innocently favored for he gain electoral vote by increasing his plurality in those states and if done he know he'll win.reason 3:Swing StatesThe winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces  the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Voters in toss up states are more likeley to pay close attention to the campeign to really listen to the competeing canidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likeley to be on the most thoughtful votes, on average(and futher reason they will have recived the most information and attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the one to decide the election.reason 4:Big StatesThe electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmentof the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida [2012] never the less obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in woyming would net the winner got 3 electoral votes.reason 5:Avoid Run-Off ElectionsThe electoral college avoids run-off elections wich no canindate recives a majority of the votes cast. For example , Nixion in 1968 and Clinton both had only 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure,wichwould greatly complicate the presidential election processes. 
by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stress-free. 
However, some teachers dislike student-designed projects since there is no clearly set standards or grading rubric, which results in a lengthy grading period. 
The Electoral College does get its votes and completes the system but you have to vote for a slate of electors, not just that but voters can't always control their vote and voters would get confused about the electors and probably would vote for the incorrect candidate. 
The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society. 
Sure it can be difficult but, there are many reasons why teacher-designed summer projects would work better. 
Community service is helpful to the community and is good for people and should be required for students. 
People really don't care about community service because they feel like it really doesn't effect them 
In paragraph 7, the text clearly states, " There was no alien monument after all."This means that aliens could not have created the Face as a signification or monument to proof thier existance. 
That's when they really thought it was a natural landform. 
instead of the kid siting in class all day learning about something that might not be instresting to them and they might start to day dream and them not learning anything. 
Students should undoubtedly make the summer packet for upcoming students. In the past, teachers have made a long, boring, and useless summer projects. In the future, students should find that their summer projects aren't a disservice. Teachers can now give students the opportunity to create summer projects that keep students engaged in learning over there rejuvenating break. 
Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. 
and it is the nearst option for planetary visit. So let me explain and make the aouthor's idea a little bit less crazy. 
We could inform them about the benefits of having a healthy world and about the things that are happening right now because of the careless acts of others. Telling people about these things will help them get an understanding of how bad things are right now and to do simple, but hard-working things can cause a great change to the world. 
But in all my oppionion should be that who ever has the most popular vote will vbe prsedent. 
With all these complications though scientest still are curious about this dangerous planet. 
Let's say, that a family member is very sick and he or she doesn't have a vehicle to drive itself to a hospital and the only way to take that person to a hospital is by calling someone for help. If that person doesn't pick up the phone, the other person that's sick could die. 
Waking up for school five days a week, at 5 a. m. is a challenge. Some teenagers, such as myself, are sleep deprived for righteous reasons: working late and completing homework or projects. Others have to do both, once in a while. But learning at home can give students an opportunity to get enough rest to get their work completed. Furthermore, some days at school are not spent learning. Instead, they are spent out of class because of school cancellations due to incliment weather, out-of-school suspensions, in-school-suspensions, or in the administrators office, getting disciplined for a violation of the dress code. Valuable instructional time is lost, whereas online education works around these obstacles. As a matter of fact, none of these factors are of importance when one is attending school from home. The minor, problematic situations at school are what make classes from home more beneficial. 
This all proves that the so called "Face on mars" was just a landform and not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the landforms made it appear to look like a face but it was just a cauincedince. 
While at school, students are being crammed into small classrooms with masses of other students, leaving each individual cramped. With only a square foot of desk space to write on, and the inability to move freely due to the molecule ratio of classroom size to students present, students are unable to concentrate on a given task. Scientists have proven through various studies that being comfortable while working has a direct effect on ones ability to produce quality work. By giving students the opportunity to work away from school, the comforts of home will aid in excelling the learning process. Students are also fed ill-nutritious foods in unnaturally short lunch periods, causing masses of students to consume foods that decrease brain power. When students are given less then 15 minutes to stuff their faces with greasy carbs before being shoved back into their classrooms, the students ability to work is compromised in ways like never before. By allowing students to work at home, they also have access to more nutritious food with reasonable eating periods. 
Over the course of summer, the projects might be forgotten if the teachers were to make them because no one enjoys them. 
We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States 
So over all yes Kids should be allowed to have their cell phones at crowd. 
Cars are manufactured. They were designed to be put on this earth and be used by responsible drivers. Having no cars as a safeguarded transportable vehicle is like having your dices tossed on the dirt and you can't predict what you have. It's not define as smart decisions, this is considered by opinions. Individuals have dissimilar opinions on driving, whether it is dangerous to get behind the wheel or that it should be outlawed. 
You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out. 
The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" states, "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally rhe losest in distance too" This is very important, it means that because that Venus is Earth like, as well as the closest planet to earth at times, its important to learn about it, in case we need to go to it at anytime. 
Secondly, The reason why the electorial college is wrong is because we dont have our own voice; but the slate of electors do which can be pretty much anybody. 
In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. 
its a good idea because if they give up their cars therre will less traffic no accidents or any parking space 
I completely disagree with your proposed policy change that if passed would not allow students to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B minimum average. This policy would be unfair to students. 
With a B average, many students may not keep up to that level, which overtime, makes them grow weaker. 
the eirth is cool so why distroit with gasis or something 
Initially the Electoral College voting method sounded like a great idea 
My first reason is i dont think a few 100 people should pickk the president, i think the entire nation should pick the president. 
The more questions and advice you seek the more you will know about the sport and the better you will get at it. 
One reason for keeping it is because the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. 
just simply slow down the use of them 
Students would easily find themselves in depression when they are unable to retain the correct grade average and such a thing would never be good for a school. Also people would have to deal with the stress of knowing that if they do not do well enough in school, they will not be able to participate in the things which they love. Such a thing is almost the same as bribing students to do well in school. Because they do well enough they're allowed to play a sport or join a club but if they don't they cannot do anything extra-curricular. 
Mars hasn't stayed the same over the years. Mars has changed a lot over the years. And Mars (aka. the red plant) will continue to changed until the end of time. 
Because of the "winner-take-all" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or unfavor them (13). 
This technology could also create a better world in general by enhancing the future generations knowledge. 
Me personaly think that cars should not be produce by conpanyes 
The ponit is " the face on mars." Yes it can be created by an alien if them were rule but there not so it maens one thing the face on mars is a natural landform. NASA can be making it up to like they can go up to mars and put the "face" were it is or something can move it. NASA can do something like that but I hlop they didn't.The face on mars could also be from someone going up tp mars and on one knowing but someone would have seen it go up. All I need to say is i think it is a natural man made landfrom or a natural landform. Bad new is no one will know wath happen or how it was made. 
The Electoral College was probably a great idea when the the Constitution fisrt started out. Then the years have gone by and now we want change. 
Then there is the issue of students believing that community service takes too much of their free time. 
There a five reasons to keep the electoral college certainty of outcome,everyone's president,swing states,big states and lastly avoid run-off elections 
This could be it, the new Facial Action Coding System ! This system is a very unique way to tell and spoil how you are really feeling and what your emotions are. This new system starts with a 3-D computer model and all of the human muscles. It will basically scan your face and tell you your emotions. 
"Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, represnting 500,000 voters would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million", also fromThe Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong 
I strongly disagree with this statement 
I believe that the school cell phone policy should be that all students should have their cell phones off at all times at school 
I believe your second policy on cell phones is the best choice. From being a student and experiencing what students do, your second policy is the right choice 
The first and likely most prominent way in which students benefit from distance learning is the case in which they miss school for an extended period of time due to illness. 
the "Facial Action Coding System" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. 
Also where would you even put the emotional expression technology, because having a huge thing in the front of the classroom would be a distraction. 
As long as you sign up with the school your attending, complete the course and earn the credit; they're able to graduate. 
yes, some scientist did believe it was an alien artifact but that was before they had HD cameras and now we can see the rock clearly. Garvin said that "If there were objects in that picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were". 
The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney. 
On the other hand, every student performing community service will help the city extremely well. 
A village have a school and they are diside learning the people, they offer for distance learning. They do meeting for that and everybody agree for that. After few week start the class. Some students visit every where and they try to teach to viliage peoples and attend to them. They think village peoples learning everything . What they are need? 
We can earn money and get a new house. You are shipping things. Things like milk dairy and other things. You could get a new house or a new car it might be able to be big small or whatever size you want it to be. 
Although few scientists believe the face was an alien artifact, a scientist named Jim Garvin proved them wrong by saying "What the picture is actually showing is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms comman around the Amercian West." Scientists Garvin is proving that the face was a nautral landform. 
because the only way that I would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. But policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time 
There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is really bad because students end up having less hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible. 
I agree with the principal because you could make new friends, 
. One it can give the student stress, by making them worried about if he or she will pass. 
The president should win over the most of our country with good qualitys that people want to see. 
an increase in the practicality 
Students having an overall strong mental stamina will help their confidence and build their knowledge. For example, taking notes, doing time consuming assignments, or in class projects in all a short period of time, will improve students stamina. Having mental stamina will help them do well on tests, SAT's, etc.. 
When looking at it from earth soemthimes it called Evening stars. Which is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky 
because students will be able to be more flexible with their schedules, 
asking many people what they would do in the same scenario might tell you there might be a clear majority leaning towards one side of the choice. 
In conclusion, video conferencing and taking online classes with distance learning is not the best thing for students, because of the conflict and problems that come with it. It can greatly affect a student's education. With online classes, students may be faced with distractions which can cause them to stay off task and bring down their grades leading to frustration and depression. This can lead to suicidal thoughts and drain a student's life. Health is very important, and it is necessary that our bodies should be healthy. Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.                      
persons point of view, the opinions you get from the people is their opinions but sometimes the person whos asking for advice will have to go to another to get their point of view. Depends on situation, the point of view really depends on how and what your situation is, like lets say they are in a fight with their best friend and they go to there parents for help, the mom might just say to talk to her and their dad might say dont talk to her anymore. Many different choices, before the person chooses they usually gets points of views from other people for advice some of these choices can be tricky to choose from. 
improve the outcome of your decision. 
I believe that for students to complete a summer project, that the students should be the designers of the projects. 
If I were old enough to vote I would want to pick the candidate who I thought would be able to lead my country in the right direction. But if the election is based on popular votes, I would feel as if my vote didnt matter. What if many people voted for one candidate but the popular vote selectes the other? Then people would feel like there is no need for voting 
By doing distance learning you as a student will not get to handle hands on stuff or go with then anywhere they go. 
I personally have no time for community service because of all the homework I have and then on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I help my dad coach my brothers soccer team. 
They could have bigger and better things because they wouldnt have to pay a car note, or pay for gas every week 
By getting extra help, you able to work on your mistakes and fix them. In this case, you are free to get assistence from you teacher regarding any concept you do not understand and he or she will be more than welcome to help you. For example, incase you are working on an assignment that is math related and there happens to be a question you have worked on several times but still can not figure out, you will then find the need to explain your weaknesses to your teacher so that they work on a solution for your concerns and questions about that specific problem you are trying to solve. As a matter of fact, if you happen to be struggling with any particular subject having teacher-designed projects is more helpful and significant hence you are attaining help and directions from a professional person who understands what they are doinig as well as what you need help on a much higher level that outstand that of a student-designed one. That being said, a teacher-designed summer project is a perfect way to continue learning because you are not only being assisted by getting extra help on a specific assignment, but you are getting more knowledge and benefiting your education even when you are not in school. In other words, you are learning from your mistakes by fixing them with the right tools you need through your teacher and that results in you being more confident and comfortable on that very topic or project you had issues with in the first place. Indeed, getting extra help from you teacher will help you get better grades and following a well teacher-designed summer project will put you in good position for working hard and working on your communication skills as well as keeping your brain sharp and training it to endure any complex situations such as making sure you complete any due work and homework on time. 
So at the end of the day I personally don't think we schools should have this type of technogoly and be more focused on other technologys like finger print sign in or school resources. 
Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform. 
GM has developed drivers seats that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object traffic jam assissant the car handle driving functions at the speed limit of 25 mph but special touch sensrs make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel. the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. these smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical. 
Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president 
Why do we need to keep it? we need to keep it because it is an important process that our founding fathers created, that is part of our constitution. 
Preventing kids from participating in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average will hinder their progress in improving their grades. 
one can absorb information coming from different people and therefore different viewpoints, 
Candidates dont't spend time in states they know will have no chance of winning. they only focus on the tight races in "swing states" that are most likely to pay closes attention to the campaign. 
is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. 
allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance 
InParis Bans Driving Due to Smog, forces have banned cars from common usage and ordered the residents to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine."Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." 
My name is Luke Bomberger, and I joined the seagoing Cowboys program, and you should too. 
The outcome of this meathod is that the Electoral College vote is possible but its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. That is why we should do Electoral College.    
the reason why this happens is because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. 
Last but not least the author gives information abouth the studies that have been done, it informs us about NASA and how it has the idea of sending humans to more indepthy study Venus. Although he or she talked about the great sides of Venus they included the down falls and the things that happen from earthqukes to volcanoes, to oceans to the way a human could live there. 
I think the second policy is better 
it prepares them for a possible future. 
Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. 
Policy 1 I believe is better because as long as the students turn the cell phones off during class time it would be fine. 
Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. 
Garvin states that " It's not easy to target Cydonia," and that its hardwork. 
There Usually selected by the candidates political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent tot he Congress and the National Archives as part of the offcial records of the presidential election . After the presidential election , your governor prepares a ' Certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ranfor president in your state along with the names of their respective  electors . 
Listening to other people explain what they think allows you to have confidence in your own decision and ease self doubt, which some people experience. 
The people that do community service, should be proud of what they do to help others, and keep up the work they do. 
But one reason why I dont know about it because one day you can be mad in not let no one know . Or want somebody to know whats going on with you. 
The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet. 
Asking for two opinions is good 
The students can express their feelings, but what are the researchers going to do with this information. 
First of all, If Earth is a safe place for us, then Venus would be too. Even the astronomers are fascinated of how much both the planets are alike. 
A second reason is that if you accept this policy a lot more kids will pay attention, and you wont have to worry about them using their phone in class or any inappropriate places. 
The lack of a teacher's presence removes the student's feeling of accountability and students often do not put in the effort to learn the class material. Online courses enable students to take tests and quizzes from home, but many cheat or plagiarize material from the internet rather than doing their work honestly. In fact, the issue had become so rampant that when students take an in-person end-of-semester exam in Generic_School, if they score significantly lower than they did on their at-home tests, they are believed to have been cheating the entire year and are required to resume the class in school rather than online. This goes to show that this is not an isolated issue; it is widespread and supremely damaging to students' grades, work ethic, and potentially even their academic transcripts. 
The future is looking very bright,the best has yet to come. Humanity is growing and advancing more and more everyday. 
Electoral College doesn't really prove anything because some people won votes and lost the presidency,thanks to electoral college. 
Many people know how to act on stage, so they could easily do that to a computer to fake their emotions. This could trick computers to doing things that it really shouldn't. This means that this technology could become tricked, making it usless in many situations 
Direction of content is almost, if not always, provided by the teacher. Teachers plan summer assignments ahead or use ones from previous years; however, they typically do not plan out the syllabus for the upcoming school year before summer break, mainly because it is too early and many adjustments can be made. 
dont have partner when are you take the classes online 
I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform. 
Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects. Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education. 
Personally i think that community service is a very good idea for this school and community to take part in. It will help our cities be more enjoyable for the people living there now and for many others in the time to come. 
Advertisments can help students feel interested on what's on the ad. I'm a student and ads appear in my laptop. Most ads I'm not interested in and I intend to skip the ad. There are new ads appearing everyday on a students phone or on their laptop. The passage states that if you smile when a web ad appears, a similar ad might follow. If you frown, the next ad will be different 
mr. ob dole was right that we should abolish the electoral collage. i beleive and it my oppion that this is not right but the candinates think so. 
Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, 
To conclude the Electoral College method is the best way to make sure all the people are getting the president the diserve. As i said in the bigging is a good neat process that is well put together and that will help mamy people out. Voting by population  vote is not safe and it's not for sure , you may think that if you vote for a president that he will win but your wrong there is a better change of him winning if the electors vote for him then you. I hope that when you are done reading this you will understand why the Electoral College should come back and it should stay.              
there are so many people on the boat with you that it is impossible not to make a friend and have fun almost every day 
Some opposed to this may say, "I do not want to do a summer project anyways, therefore let me choose the topic". I agree that the topic of the project may be more interesting if it is student-designed, 
The development of a human contolled car is not the reason for the cars not being far more advanced, but the safety of the drivers and passengers. 
And what about the special education children or the less intelligent students who struggle just to pass? What about the people who can only get a C if they try their hardest? They would find themselves isolated, neither able to do well in school, nor able to do well in sports or other activities because they wouldn't be allowed to participate in them. Though I may be talking extremes, such a thing would be likely to increase the possibility that one of those misfortunate students would commit suicide! And a life is a life no matter how that person does in academics. 
To get second opinion you have to go ask someone. But without realizing it, we ask for second opinion's so often that it's just daily life 
another reason the electoral college is an stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privelges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states. Its final the electoral college is unfair outdatedand irrational. 
Some of the developments that would be removed from the education system are: an equal access to physical school resources across the school, 
One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. 
I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. 
inclusivity 
The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that they know the content best. 
What they have done was ban cars for a day to try and to lower air pollution. They as well gave out 25 dollar fines to all the violaters that did not participate with program built. Now, are you seeing my point? Can you see were my point is going? Trying to litmit car usage is what im trying to say. If only we could all be like Mr. Sivaks son, who takes Bay Area Transit when he can, im pretty sure that this whole pullution and global warming, wont be as quite frustrating to think about, or worring as to what will happen next to all the pollution. 
What the pictures they actually took show is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common in the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho", Garvin says. Garvin ended his statement with,"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." 
The last time I checked it was By the people, For the people. I believe that the American people have the right not a berucratt sitting on his butt all day doingNothing other than voting with the Electoral Voting. 
they cant focus during school cause of distractions, 
the Electoral College has many benefits when voting for president. 
There is litter everywhere in this town and we need people to pick the litter up. 
All my life I have grown up with older people, people who are at least forty or higher. They have given me all sorts of advice, good and bad. 
they have family problems or beacuas they just dont like being home scholled no more beacuas they want to do more things they wan tot learn more beacuas they feel like they are not learing the thing that they are learnig at home. 
Overall, this article about Venus is less than "stellar". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up. All in all, the author does not support their idea the best. 
Also the winner take all deal is when the person with the most vote would take the others votes beacsue that person dont have all of the votes, so the person with the most votes would take all of the votes. This is from passage Dose the electoral college work? 
The Electoral College is the same thing people are trying to change because in the article "What is the Electoral College" by the Office of the Federal Register it states " The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a president...". 
There is no harm in public schools having the option of taking school online. Online school isn't for everyone but going to school isn't for everyone either. 
With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students. Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start. For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year. This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working. It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project. 
Asking for advice from someone isn't always easy, because most of the time people tend to worry about what a persons response to their situation would be. 
Opinions are everything when seeking advice and exploring different views is one of the most solid ways to make the right decision. 
The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. 
One thing a person could face while attending online school is isolation. 
because lets say your driving to another state an you dont want to drive for number of hours all you have to do is just switch to autopilot an have the car drive it self seems like a good idea doesnt it? Though it seems like a great idea from google...Did google ever stop an think about the saftey of others? Did google stop an think about safety period? 
it is better for the environment because it reduces greenhouse gasses and causes less polution and smog. 
These cars are coming closer and closer to becoming a reality that could be in every house by 2020. Much like everything else, they have their pros, and cons, but ultimatley prove that ve are one step closer to a better, safer tomorrow. 
Venus's knickname is sometimes called the "Evening Star" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.It is also called the "Evening Star" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth. 
he single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. 
Community Service is like helping someone stay out of trouble. Keep you busy at all times and doing the right things. It Keep you from doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Community Service is like a job, but you not getting paid out of it. Most of time some people can do community service by doing the right thing or they can do something with they life by doing community service.Community Service is a activity , and i think we should do Community Service. 
If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life. 
and will only use votes of qualified citizens. 
I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect 
He explains that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in the solar system even though the one planet being close to the sun is Mercury. This is something unique to say about Venus. 
Seeking multiple opinions and advice can be beneficial to someone because it can provide new ideas that previously have never been thought of, and help understand different perspectives on the topic. It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes.  
I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that "...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face." 
Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size ,and occasionally the closest in distance too, venus is a planet visit for the people,venus have many things that are interesting the people vistit this place for know somethings that they don`t know but they need know venus is one planet that are close with mart and earth venus is study for the humsn science.A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon blankets venus. On the planet the temperatures average can be over a 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is like 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet,the conditions of the this planet can be more extreme than anything humans encounteron the planet earth venus is the only planet that have hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,the other planet that are closer to the sun is mercury , beyond high pressure and heat.Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting of volcanes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to a lang on its surface. venus have nomerous factors that contribute reputation as a challenging platent for humans to study,despite its aproximity to us, venus should have a sulfuric acids in the venus atmosphera 
Students being able to design there projects could allow the student to create something they enjoy doing over the summer with friends and family, rather then students thinking of it as another teacher assined project that is boring 
Not only do student designed projects give students an extra opportunity to learn, but it also provides students with a sense of real world experiences that enhance learning, and general skills. 
I think the United States should keep the Elector College 
if we were to just not use vehicles a few days out of every month, then these recouces may slowly start to build back up. 
For example, "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning..."The Office of the Federal Register , this shows how it is not really fair to all the states as even if the popular vote comes close, the winning candidate takes all the electoral votes. 
But, if you really think it's a good idea that kids help their community, maybe in some classrooms, teachers could put a donation box 
For the kids that do not participate in community service, well why don't they? It is a fantastic way to help others and there is no reason why not to do it. 
In 1968, Nixon, and in 1992, Clinton, both only had about 43 percent of the popular votes which was not enough. This is a problem because it complicates the presidential electon process. This is where the Electoral College comes in hand; the outcome of the votes becomes very clear this way 
First, is a way of helping, and growing together as a community. 
Students need a way to communicate with out making too much noise. 
In paragraph 3, it says, "such environment would crush even a submarine...and would liquefy many metals." This shows that they know that what type of metals they need to use. 
I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good. 
If students were able to design their own summer project, it would not only give them creative freedom but allow them to feel proud of what they turn in, regardless if they stay in the class. 
but as we continued to research it. It became known to us that something was casting a shadow as we said in our article about the "Unmasking the Face on Mars" 
l think that by doing a good service to the community will be good to our school, especially friends, and families that help serve in the community. 
Think about this, in college, they give you scholarships for academics and athletics.But if you play for a team and your grades aren't so well, are they going to keep you on the team?Probably not.This is the same as how you should run our school.We need to prepare for college and by running our school similar to colleges, it will help us to learn how college is ran. 
like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school. 
Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. 
The news always updated when people do something stupid around that involves their phones. The safest way is the best way to stay safe. 
Considering others thoughts on a situation is important because it can show you how others handle a situation. Plus, you might change the way you think about things. For example, if you have a friend that is constantly being mean to you, your first thought may be to argue and fight with her. But, if you go to another few people, I'm sure they will most likely tell you that violence isn't the best option, and that you should stay calm and work things out verbally. When you think about and understand others points of view, it can hep you gain knowledge, plus if the advice dosen't work you will know not to use again. Everyone learns from their mistakes, just as well as they can learn from bad or non realistic advice. Even just a few people can change they way you would have handled a problem. 
Im giving you all these reasons why the electoral college isnt fair because it needs to change.    
Considering this, the most effective conclusion is not one that comes only from the viewpoints of one person. 
Most voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, "... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now," (paragraph 9). Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. 
Maybe if they were forced to choose one activity, they would find a passion in that activity that they didn't know that they had 
Using phones at school is not no big deal if you think about it. 
However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way (12). 
the technology is available, 
My second reason is that the community can benefit from this requirement if you put it into action. 
Then he starts putting a chip in evevyones body and we get told when to eat and when not to eat. Then he or she starts to put us in concentration camps and we get paid 2 cents a hour and killed if we dont cooperate. 
because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it. 
The truth is most of these things do not even have enough evidence to prove what they are saying. They just believe it is true because it is intresting. They do not even have the proof that aliens exist,and as cool as it may seem, it is just not true. I know some people will come to their senses and realize what they are saying when they say that they believe aliens exist and people just look at them like they are stupid. 
I think that having the school do community service is a great idea! 
On the contrary, they are extremely wrong because you wouldn't be able to see them everyday as you normally do during the school day. 
Doing something created by you is completely different from doing something made by another person. 
The text says, "Often referred to as Earth's twin." Venus is closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. This shows that people may know Venus as a different version as Earth. This relates that the author supports the idea of studying Venus is worthy because it is very similar to Earth, so why not study it and explore it? The author may think that Venus can be somewhere people can survive in and look more forward to. 
Students should get the chance to disigne their own projects. By doing so they could gain more knowlege on the subject the project is on. This could come to their benfit by them getting oppourtunties and better grades.              
and reduce distractions that could prevent students from succeeding. 
Long ago, Venus was like our planet Earth because back then it has trees and same atmosphere as Earth. But now Venus is dry up and only a dry vellays where water used to flow a montains left.   
It would be nice for everyone to have one of these because drunk driving issues would go down. 
other students could have other events to attend to 
Astronmers are fascinated by venus because it may once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. 
Having a life without a car can sometimes be a bit scary exspecially if you need to do ,or be somewhere in the middle of the night . you may be ill and need a doctor immedialty you wouldnt be able to walk . 
This acts as little as they may seem will make a difference in the end. 
as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, 
this will indeed create a busy lifestyle therefore not giving time to do unnecessary or harmful things to themselves of the student body. 
its great for the community and their moral caricature. 
To begin with the electoral college system the people like me dont get to vote for president i have to vote for someone else to vote for me in that i feel like my vote doesnt count 
Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it 
school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity 
By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents. Within students exploring new things they gain knowlege and gain more expreince on ther project. 
Our school should have these extracurricular activities 
Colleges see if and what you have done in terms of extracurricular stuff, because they don't want someone who they think will do the bare minimum and barely get through. Colleges care about their image. So as far as the colleges are concerned good students equals good looks and good looks equals more demand college which equals more money. Part of that image is sports, in fact if you are good enough at a specific sport so much that they want you to be on their team they will pay for you to go to their college, this is called a scholarship. The better the students a college gets the more attractive it looks, the more students my high school sends to college the more attractive my high school looks and the students have a higher chance to go to college, its a win, win, win! 
One of the many reasons why schools exist is to provide a social setting that students are able to immerse themselves in. Schools provide a setting in which students are able to able to socialize with other students, creating a group or community for themselves as they form friends with the students they attend these classes with. 
Many of us rely on technology without knowing the right procedure to take when it fails us. 
If we use it in class we should get it taken but not from everybody but just for that person who didn't do what she/he was told. I would like this policy in the school. 
In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. 
As common technology improves and computers get smarter, sensors get more accurate, and technology becomes more reliable, the driverless cars stand more of a chance against the roads of today. 
Lastly, aliens aren't real so how could something unreal make a face on mars? 
Also its Unfair to the voters because of the winner-takes-all system. In each state candidates dont spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing"  states 
we should make the choice ourselfs so it matters more in the long run 
For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home 
not only the technology can help schools it can also help people with their business, 
The article is obviously talking about the Making of Monalisa Face. It talks too about the Facial Action Coding System. It´s a program or system that knows if you are sad, mad, happy, etc. The guys who are helping now are Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. The creator of Facial Action Coding System is Dr. Paul Eckman. 
Reckless drivers are dangers, they have no care for the world or people who are in it. 
In paragraph one it tells the percentages on Mona Lisa, that going way to far with personal space and thought. Some things are meant to be un said and if a teacher asks you in class how you felt about that certain situation they can tell if your lying or not, and that´s your choice if you want to express that. 
Some dangers that it persents would be that not all of Venus is safe and not all of space is safe either 
One of these approaches are the simplified electronics that were tested in a chamber that is supposed to simulate Venus' chaotic surface, and lasted for three weeks. 
Student's are in school for hours they will focus better if they are in a more comfortable environment. Maybe some students are introverts, being in school causes stress and pushes students to do things they don't want. Student's are more likely to participate if they are under less stress. 
This means that what a person learns from making a good decision from others opinions now, can also help them make other better decisions in the future. 
I support the policy change of requiring students to have at least an average grade of a B in order to play sports or participate in other activities 
So that's why we shouldn't get community service cause some people just don't understand about it. And just want to do fun stuff and play around with their friends, and play with all the electronic stuff. 
Making better decisions is another outcome for asking multiple people for advice. 
Whenever we have Snow or a virus outbreak we have to cancel school this will no longer need to happen as most kids have internet at home and can work from home. 
Driverless Cars can help people life more easier. Even if it can make the environment much better than before. Because now we have many cars drive on the street and they will have some bad thing to make the environment be bad.A lot of people, they are smart. They think that in one day, we maybe making computer-diven cars. In fact, this is a smart way to make people llife easier. But this make more and more people to make smarter than this way to make people life easier.Then they find a new way to developed driver's seats and they have lights. It can help them drive on the road at night and make people to be safety. 
Having classes at home is a very big step for the schools but it can be done and it would make a huge impact to the students and the parents.If a student did not feel comfortable with the school environment having them be at home in their space, and area it could show a lot of postive results to other parents and students. Students wouldn't have to feel groggy in the morning or be late to any class since they could just be at home and take everything at their own pace with a specific time end date of course. Having classes at home instead of going to school would be a big difference in the world today.  
It's already a risk traveling in space, but it's an even bigger risk to travel to Venus. Here are some of the reasons why Venus isn't safe. 
imaginate if the computer know when your happy or sad, that well be so cool 
If u pay for that car or truck and pay for the the gas that they sale you should be able to drive that car or truck wherever u want to. And if they new it was gonna cause harm to the environment then why did they do it i mean that's pretty dumb. They new that them hazardous gasses and fumes were gonna mess things up so why would they do it.But u have to have these vehicles and semis to be able to transport goods from place to place do i mean your really just gonna have to deal with it cause u have to have them cause whose gonna hall all that stuff by hand one by one nobody and its just a waste of time cause u would kill yourself trying to do it so why not just use a semi that uses left over stuff from gas that way there not dumping all that stuff out on the ground ans its not going down and pouluting our water let it puluote our air but if we don't have that water we couldnt go 3 days and we could were gas masks if it come down to it its really not that big of a deal.There making this how smog thing a big deal they can come up with something to help that or go away that is just so stupid that they do that cause they can prevent some of it with safe idle and emmisind but they dont want to hold to there laws ad people that are doing it they just let them go on like there doing and they do nothing about. Why would they do wat they are doing and not help us out and quit taking our rights away.       
Stated in source 2, " Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanksto the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now." In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continure with an Electoral college. 
Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors 
That technology would not help in schools because the fact that students are sometimes not happy with how computer ads put up. 
Since Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, the distance are similar too. This planet has different speeds. Though, humans have sent many spacecrafts to this dangerous land. Each mission was unmanned sicne no spacecraft ever survived the landing for a few hours. 
and probably do some community service there self. 
I am writing you today because I find we should not be using the electoral college. It doesn't make much sense to make things so much more complicated than they have to be. 
Summer projects are seen as a way to make sure that students are learning. These summer projects are usually teacher-designed. 
the election of the President is by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
But that's what further devlopment is for. FACS will keep pushing and making more progress when being able to tell a person's emotion. 
Another reason is because in paragraph 4, the author states "Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit." 
Many people believe that giving students the opportunity to take their classes online would not be beneficial and by doing so, schools would be decreasing the likelihood of productivity in their students. 
two they see if there's something wrong with one of the students 
In order to graduate at many public and private schools, students must meet graduation requirements.There are multiple classes a student must take to graduate that are electives.These classes take up space in kid's schedules restricting the amount of core classes a student can take.If schools allow these kids to take these classes in their free time, students will be able to complete these courses and move onto classes they will use in the future.For example, all school require students to partake in a health class throughout their high school careers.If students are capable of taking this class in the summer rather than in the school year, a new gap in their schedule opens for another class.Also, online schools prevent advance students from burning out.Many children who were placed in advanced learning at a young age experience a burn out.This occurs when the student does not have to work as hard in their education as others.This produces a poor work ethic, which is essential in the real world.By allowing these students to take an extra course online, they will be challenged forcing them to improve their work ethic and time management.Online school gives students a chance to get ahead in their education 
They know they have helped the community and this gives them a sense of accomplishment. If community service was required in school, students that did community service by choice anyway will not feel accomplished after doing community service if they had to do it. This takes away the feeling of accomplishment, and discourages students that used to do community service to do community service by choice anymore. Then all students will probably only do the bare minimum and it will not be helping the community since barely any people will do community service. 
And its very inportan to have a phone at school just in case something happiness to you or when your on the bus 
For centuries, we have followed a certian system estabolished by our founding fathers. This system is called the electoral college. This system is based off voting for the president through electoral votes rather than based off more popular. The state has an overall say through its electors 
Plenty of people have made incredible careers from the experience of learning at home, so it is a possibility for those students who get the chance to learn at home. Students will have a chance to be prepared for a possible future if they so desire while getting a different learning experience from it all. 
"Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin" Paragraph 2, is perfect arguement to start with, because as you can see venus is already considered as twin of Earth. It's natural geographic is similar to Earth's, so it already proves Venus could had a possibility of having oceans, lake, and bodies of water in the past. The density and size is same to Earth too so we will have vaguely same space as Earth. Venus is too hot to survive so we can do blimp-like vehicle above venus and still stay in their gravity and have people survive in the atmosphere above the fray. We could send people over there to research first before doing anything, If they makes people feels safer about living on Venus. 
Times has changed a lot. Fifty years ago kids didn't go to school because they had to help their parents out on the farm. Now we have computers, video games, cell phones. All these things that distract us from what is really important, helping people. 
you never know what could happen . 
Some people are going to say that happens regardless of whether or not it's in person or online. 
Just like the belief in wether or not earth and people were made by god or science. They're both theories that's why people have to have "faith" in what they believe. The Big Bang theory for example is a theory because it doesn't have enough evidence to be proven that it legitimately happened. It goes the same with religion. 
The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years 
Anxiety is becoming increasingly more common and that anxiety is often caused by social interactions. For students with such stresses, asking questions in class and asking teachers or fellow students for help is very difficult. The ability to ask such questions online will make them more comfortable and able to learn. If a student is unable to ask a question in class because they fear that they will be judged or make a mistake, they will continue to be confused about whatever it is they had a question about 
I was also able to learn a lot about animals just from taking care of them 
When we vote for something, we want our vote to determine our President, not determine who our electors will vote for. 
Technology fails everyday so why put it in a car and put human lives at risk? 
So many unanswered possibilites could go wrong with this idea and production of ¨driverless cars¨. 
Conducting a teacher-designed project will give you the opportunity to share ideas with fellow classmates, for the reason that you will all be working on the same project. Teacher-designed projects also give light to the idea of having a partner. 
The age of the car may be coming to an end. Communities have started promoting a car free life style. Made othe ways of transportation avaliable. The younger people in the community have quit driving all together. Wether becuase it is good for the enviorment or a choice they had to make becuase of the city they live in. Transpotation is evolving into a public affair, not a personal one. The automotive industry may take a hit but in the long run this could be beneficial for our planet. There will always be car buffs, but sooner rather then later, you may not own a car altogether. 
I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision. 
This article is abaut the platent of venus that are sometimes called Evening Star this is the secon planet from our sun,this planet is one that tje people can see from a large distance it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. this is the most dangerous for the people because the sun is like the fire the people can`t see and touch this in a short distance the sun and they light can be beautiful but is it most thing that is dangerous in the universe. 
Studying Venus is a good idea and learn more about the Venus from other planet and Venus has a pretty good nickname and The National aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study venus, Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. 
nonetheless a single voter`s vote. 
This would help students to be much more creative and would allow them to properly highlight what they learned 
Asking a single person for his opinion will only result in one perspective of the topic 
In addition, cell phone providers have also run campaigns against the lethal act. 
I think people who drive and pay more attention to their phones should be arrested and have their lisecen taken away because the could cause crashes , deaths and traffic 
thats what i dont understand they dont let some people vote cause there age which is stupid they should  let them vote thats the reason why ther areso many disputes in the world cause of the ignorance of some people and the only thing the people from electoral college is worried about iswinning instead of carring for the other people which is not right that is the reason so many outbreaks happen cause people start to not even give a crap about the people that is wanting to vote but the people is not worriedtwo cents about what anyone else thinks their just worried bout  themselves which is stupid and they should have been done something about this before it get to much out of control which is leading to much more problems it needs to come to a end and pick a president who would actually give a care about the people of the united states  instead them going around and talking about them in different ways that is not needed cause only a majority of people votes for him doesnt mean that he or she has to be a complete jerk to them and start talking bout them in bad ways that is how many fights start and when they start they dont ever stop talking bout it for a long period of time which pisses people off what if someone started talking bout you or your parents you would want to beat the crap out of them then there would be catastrophic failure which leadsto more and more drama which just makes things even worse nominees get happy that they won the vote and start getting all crazy and start saying things just to get people all ticked off and things that really didnt meanto happen happens to people that did not even do anything to hurt that person at all which is messed up cause they dont give no effort to even say they are sorry for what they did to that person the advocates that are in the position they say things that make arguements and other things that dont need to happen begin which doesnt make things any easier it just causes more drama that doesnt need to happen cause even more trouble that is not a good thing to have happen when that happens it just has bad things happening everywhere and it only makes things worse which leads to cause even more drama in peoples life and it doesnt seem fun getting out of all that drama that happened    
Would you be able to do what Luke Bomberger did? Just step right up folkes and sign up for free today! 
The students would be unhappy with this decision and maybe some parents would too. This would cause the school to have unpleasant school days, knowing they will have to do community service when they get home. 
Also, having a C average can affect your future greatly. 
students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home. 
As of now, only a percentage of schools allow this, but if this opportunity were introduced to more schools, the whole county would have a higher success overall 
One reason is they would play volley ball, baseball,and table tennis. Also, the Seagoing Cowboys did fencing and boxing. Except if you are layed back and calm you can read! You have a lot of fun things you can do on board. 
I will have to say no because you can't use technology to see someone emotional. 
Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital. 
I see a community were there is no trash in the roads or fields, there are kids helping their elders, and even students wanting to help the community, this can be us. 
The law should be made by the government that they can tract the minimum usage while driving and even if they must set up the navigation, they can pull over and do it. So, they can pull over to the side to use the phone and should be made on the interstate and the street. 
Before taking this enourmous step in technological advancement, humans must consider the flaws within this newly developed system, 
asking students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good idea. I believe that students school and social life will change for the better. It may take some time to see the positive effects that this new rule will have on the school, but there will definitely be a huge, great difference within the school's community.     
Electoral Colleges process consists the selection of the electors and has a meeting with the electors where they vote for the President and Vice president 
No matter if Venus dangers could be extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, it is the most talk about planet to study it's worthy pursuit, With sights that once was familiar like Earth and various forms of life that has the humans curiousity on Venus.   
Have you ever seen an alien? In 1976 the camera weren't as good as today so it could be anything. But today the cameras are great quality. 
Bullying has become a massive problem at schools. Many teens have taken their own life because they would get bullied everyday at school 
People can offer many different point of views on the situation and can provide different opinions about the situation. 
They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy. 
The author tries to justify the dangers by explaining technology that will be used in order to allow individuals to study Venus. 
If you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also. 
experits have proven that it is just a landformation and was not bulit by any extra living beings that have lived there a longtime ago 
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," by Nick D'Alto, describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. There is a paragraph where it can detect students facial action, 
In all decisions, there are multiple paths to take, but another influence can help not only to choose the right path, but to find new one (if needed). 
Most people would think of an electoral collage as a place rather than a system. The Electoral collage was a process that was create to help make voting easier when in fact it complicated things. I agree with with source 2 paragraph 14. paragraph 14 clear states "It's official: The electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational." 
One reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because what if someone gets elected as president and for example he or she decides to begin a marshal law in the whole united states. 
However, this is not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of other well-educated voters in other states who have opinions that will never be counted because of the electoral college. 
What happens when a kid that has a b average, gets one bad grade and goes down to a c average in the middle of the season and is the best player? 
these examples from these four sources inform citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. And there are some really good examples that inform you about limiting car usage. 
I  belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
There are people that come from all different backgrounds, that you may not have classes with at school, that may be in different grades, or that you may have never known without participating in an extracurricular activity. These new people will share the same interests as you which is a great way to be able to do things together and it gives you an opportunity to be able to learn from each other. By being in an extracurricular activity where you get to meet these new people, you'll have an opportunity to hang out with them on a regular basis when you may not have been able to do that any other time. These are just some of the other many benefits that an extracurricular activity can bring. 
Just imagine how good of a idea this would be 
In conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.   
If you are a parent and you child text saying they need you because they're not feeling well, have to text them back because they are not allowed to really use their phone in school so you can't call them. 
I am against driverless cars for many reasons. 
You guys do should go to camps like these there very fun. 
The life of a student is extremely difficult; they are forced to do things that most adults cannot even do. They are told to somehow find time for everything: school work, sports, hobbies, family, friends, and most importantly to be a kid. During the school year, the fact that the student is still a kid is most times forgotten. Summer vacation is their chance to finally be a kid, or at least feel like one. By allowing the student to take part in a student designed project,they are able to take part in activities that they actually want to do, or research things that they are actually interested in. It is always hard to find compromise, but if given an option to satisfy students as well as teachers, why not choose it? 
This world is turning into a darker place. The problem is that people don't care enough. We see homeless people on the side of the street and no one stops there cars. We tend to ignore what is bad. Out of sight out of mind. I think that is ridiculous. We need to help others. If we don't then who will? 
the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president  taht ought to be overruled by declaring  the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. 
but I really think we should even though it has some flaws, here is my three reasons why. 
At home, a student has limited resources and won't be able to receive support and feedback from teachers and classmates. If a student takes a class online, there won't be any teacher to tell him or her what and how to do the work. And so if a student is stuck on what they're supposed to do, or if they did something incorrectly, then they won't be have the chance for improvement or learn from their mistakes. Feedback is critical for a student's growth, and without a personal relationship with a teacher, there is no growth 
some people have base ball or some other sport to go to 
Students and teachers may also argue about this topic,some students and teacher might agree to offering distance learning because traveling would be easier due to online assignments. Distance learning can be done anywhere and anytime around the world. 
Have you ever wanted a yearbook? yearbooks have many memories, and excitment . You can be apart of this exciting journey. 
and also you can feel really good that you aren't only helping yourself you are helping others 
But if we used the new technology that could read the kids faces and change the course of the class to make it more interesting, then more kids wouldn't be bored all the time and they will be able to learn more about the subject that they are learing about. 
I dont think popular vote would get us a good president 
By getting advice from others, you can make good decisions, as people can give you insights into your problem and help you to make the best choice. When you simply get advice from others, your ability to make the right decision is greatly increased, as you can find more options, understand the problem better, discover some of the repercussions your decision may have, and find out what others think the best action for you to take is. By discovering all of this, you can make an informed decision based on it, which will almost always be better than an impulsive decision that could have serious consequences. Getting advice from others will always be helpful in making the right choices. 
it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate. 
Everyone expresses themselves in different ways which make them who they are. If my principal ever gave this opportunity to my school then I would be thankful 
If I was a scintst at NASA discussing the Face. I whould have to prove to the person i was discussing with that it was made by it,s self not alien to do that i need facts about mars. 
The author goes on to list the physical dangers of Venus: "On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet" (The Challenge 3). On Venus, the temperature alone could liquify many metals and completely destroy spacecrafts that were sent there. Also, the pressure of the atmosphere could crush a submarine fit for diving to the deepest parts of the ocean. 
A lot of Americans are buying less cars, a study last year found out that driving by young people decresed 23 percent betweeen 2001-2009. Executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical.    
help you think clearly and put things into perspective just a little more 
They compare some ideas to it just like the "Middle Butte in the snake river of Idaho." There had never been sightings of aliens before why would there be now. 
some times people could like try new things out. People could also no like change in their schedule. Forcing stuff on people isnt the best option. There is always a chance they might like the club. You might make some new friends. 
Many of these teachers have been teaching this information for a couple years. This means that these teachers have a good idea of what the students know from this school year and what information they should be prepared for in the coming school year. This information would greatly aid in making the Summer projects because the teachers would know how to format it in a way that students are familiar with but also prepares them for the new information that will be presented in the next school year. This would be very helpful to kids because it sets them up for success in the next year. 
The electoral college is a prodess that our founding fathers established 
They'll either be to busy to not do homework or to lazing to do school work. Or the student will be too sleepy in class. Also the student might not be focusing in school as much as they used to. 
What students look forward to in a project is how fun it could be or how much fun could they could get out of it. So allowing students to design their projects can help improve not only creativity but learning. Students want to go all out and when they get to see that opportunity it's amazing what students can do. It's overall amazing what is in a students mind, they just need to let it all out. This also helps them as they arent pressured to stay in the standards of the project. 
For example, some simplidied electronis made os silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulatiing to chaos of Venus's surface and hahve lasted for three weeks in such conditions"(7). Nasa finally thinks they have found somethng they could use that was made a lon time ago. it is called the mechanical computer the device was first envisioned in the 1800s and played a important role in the 1940s during WWII. the reason scientist believe they can use this is because the device makes calculations by using gears and leavers and do not need electronics at all, so they are saying systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. 
The electoral collage is not a democratic methode of selecting on who WE WANT AS PRESIDENT 
While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person's emotional state. 
The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students. 
its better 
The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it 
Teachers most go to college to become teachers and be hired by a school. This means: they have a degree on education, are certified to be teachers, and they understand the subject better than students. In addition, they have experience from previous years and students. So they understand that students learn differently. Consequently, they can come up with a method to make the project educative and impactful for every student; regardless, of how different they learn. For these reasons, the summer projects should be teacher designed. 
In order to get the good advice you need, you should ask more than one person. 
Letting us have cell phone during lunch could turn out to be very beneficial for parents and students. 
Driveless cars are coming. Whether you will buy or support this new idea or not is your choice. 
Our counrty has been doing very well compared to the other countrys like Korea, Africa, Cuba, China, and etc.  People should just be grateful and apperciative that the United States is doing as well as it is doing.  The Electoral College is a benifit and it should not be abloished or eliminated from congress, but it should be improved.  We as americans should try to advance our country in every way possible, not eliminate something if it does not go our way.  We should try to cooperate and improve on the mistakes to make our country better and progress everyday so that today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow better than today! 
Keeping Electoral Colleges also restores some of the weight in the politicaal balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. 
The policy i believe is better is policy one 
Technology should be used to benefit everyone even those against it. Society, manufacturers, inventors, they should all be using techonology to improve the world and improve the health instead of creating things that harm potentially or could cause more lazy citizens. 
Now you're probably wondering, does high school students even know what the Electoral College is and what it's job? Yes, high school students do know what the Electoral College is and what it does. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors. Your state amount equals one member from the House of Represenatives and two from the Senate. The electors are chosen from the candidate's political party. The Electoral College decides the president and vice president every four years every Tuesday ater the first Monday in the month of November. 
But, one reason this is a bad idea is because students like to express themselves in anyways possible, 
they be trying hard to pull up their grades but it won't wroth it cause you want let them participate because you want everybody that has an "A" or a "B" average. Another reason, why because students would look at you, and say "we tried ", and it would not be right to see other students playing. 
They fully loaded the car to be very protected at all times but its not like they cant break or just not work. 
Well i choose election because the election is a better way of letting the oters express their ideas. 
It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. 
An opinion is just someones personal view or idea of the subject, So it is always great to get multiple opinions or perspectives about the topic. 
promoted a happier society 
some take colleg class at home some start their corears but taking online class at home or some just do the things/follow the step their perent. 
less usage of cars can lower stress and is safer. 
NASA said it was a "huge rock information" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens. 
When "we the people" vote for the president, we are not actually doing what we have come to believe. In reality, we are actually voting for representatives calledElectors to vote for the canidate. 
Lets say your parent/parents are being held up and can't pick you up from school, so then somebody else has to pick you up or take the bus home. You play for the school's baseball team and a last minute game was scheduled and you have to play today in 30 minutes, but your parent/parents doesn't know so how are going to get a ride home. You have to get your or borrow somebody else phone to call him/her. 
State Senator, We should keep the Electoral college. The process is great. There are many great things about the Electoral college. Its a big help with alot. Theres no dobut about the College.      
You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good. 
I'm in favor of the Electroral college because "the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense". 
the small city in columbia bogota also took part in reducing the emmissions in the air. bogta encouraged the public to stay inside and anyone violating this rule was fine 25 dollars, many people would take out their bicycles and ride those around opposed to driving and polluting the air. the campaign in bogota bagan in the mid 1990s and has constructed 118 miles of bike paths ever since 
t simplifies the outcome 
In life, we are expected to learn. We learn how the world works, how to do things, and learn from the mistakes we make along the way. Now, it is only fair to say that everyone has a different and unique way of learning, whether it be through hands on activities, trial and error, or just being told what to do. The demand for these needs is high due to the rising population in public schools, and not every student's needs can be met at all times. Some of the students may struggle based on how the curriculum is taught in one class, and excel in another one taught differently. It all depends on how each student receives information the best. Certain educational centers provide distance learning, which provides students with the opportunity to complete their studies and courses online. The courses offer students the chance to have video conferences, independent learning, and many more things that are made for the single purpose of ensuring education. 
We all have to do homework. Some of us are involved with after school activity's(sports, and clubs). Then there is also kid's like me that not only don't have time on the weekdays for community service but on the weekends I have no time for it. 
This essay is on if I think the use of technlogy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
because if more people sign up for the yearbooks the pictures can be done faster. 
The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. 
NASA has an future plan to send humans to study Venus because NASA wants t o experiemnt life on Venus. I know this because in the article it says " Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." Another reason would be "scientist even discussing further visits to its surface." Final reason would be because "Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us." This is why NASA plans to send humans to study about Venus. 
People think that it looks like a face and I cant not argue with that 
it made him more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need. 
Below for those students that don't like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. 
There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.     
The face on Mars cannot be created by aliens 
Schools provide students with an interactive and effective institution to learn and develop social skills. And while, as an individual becomes older and the material being taught becomes more complex, school can be difficult to keep up with, an increased workload and higher stress levels are an unavoidable part of life that comes with maturing. 
If they don't have time out of school 
All students should have a sport to keep them active for a while and not get distracted by any thing like walking around the class. 
Abolishing the Electoral college should be the right thing to do.  
costs lots of money 
In conclusion, there are many benefits from being able to attend school classes from home through online school or video conference calls. Some examples include: reduced stress, ability to fulfill other responsibilities and prioritize hobbies, and finally, develop valuable skills that will assist with success in the online course and life after high school. Generic_School is very aware of the damage some students suffered from because they were compelled to attend school away from home, so they instituted the Hybrid Program and Virtual Generic_School, which allows the students to take either all their classes from the comfort of their home, or just a few so they take a few courses in the building and others at home. This gives the students the power to control their schedules and make their high school experience and academic load less stressful.            
Everyone has just been seeing this information in magazines and on T.V. and believeing it is true,but they never seem to believe the truth that it is not a Face created by aliens. This is common for this planet to create natural landforms as well. 
So in conclusion no human can last very long on Venus, making it interesting but hard to research do to that no spacecraft survived more that a couple of hours on Venus. The atmosphere is dangerous to people. It has the hottest surface temperature. 
some students just feel more comfortable having their phones with them, 
you can gain multiple points of view, 
I belive  we should change the way for election 
While understandable, this is inaccurate because students already have a lot of responsibilities. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, has a part time job, plays baskeball, and tutors her younger siblings. It would be difficult for her to create a summer project because she has so many other responsbilities. If she would have to design a summer project she wouldn't be able to give her time to her other priorities. Furthermore, making a summer project would result in her being stressed out. 
Driverless cars could be the next common technology among the human population like computers or phones.From this, humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar to this subject.However, another choice for us, individually is whether or not to accept change.        
Thats what i think about if it should be changed or not 
Earth is covered in these mesas so more than likely other planets including Mars probably have buttes and mesas 
When you talk to more than one person, you know more the possible outcomes. 
You may think that one word is good, but then your friend from a different country might think that that word is horrible! See now no one person is the same so that's why sometimes if you have and opinion on something then maybe you should ask someone else that has a different cultural background from you. One thing that famous politicians do is check with other people with different backgrounds to make sure that they don't offend people when they don't want to. Before you go out and start blabbing on about some other country maybe you should try and talk to the people from that country so then you don't offend them? You as a person will never be the same than anyone else. I personally have friends from other countries that eat dogs but look here, in the USA if someone eats a dog, that is very illegal. That's a perfect example of how people with other backgrounds will differ in opinions. So as you've read, most people that are different from you will widely differ in opinions from you. 
All in all the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced with direct elections. This gives citizens more control over who they elect (which is supposed to happen in a Democracy). The people now freedom of choice, and the majority would be happy with the new leader of the free world.     
the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal 
I've said how school has helped me develop long lasting relationship by putting my in a space where being social was somewhat mandatory. 
In result of this big idea these cars will not come out depending on the company. The first one would be from tesla that can drive 90 percent of the time with autopilot. Other car companies plan to have these types of cars around by the year of 2020. Everyday something new has been made or to the world. We get closer each and everyday to a destination of new product.    
,if you go school to get a education you need a few money for lunch. Those student who have a car to go school ,they can save their gas money which help to save your money. those student who like to stay home and study distance learning help you. distance learning help you every single second of your life. if you go or move anywhere and there is no any school for study it help you to get knowledge about every thing. 
Like with the new virus that is spreading it is a big discussion all over the world talking about it some are scared and some are happy because they are shutting down schools al over the world, but what I'm trying to say is it is all in their point of view. 
When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. 
Driverless cars can make you think about the "What Ifs," 
Isn't our country a great country to be looked upon by the world? But how could this greatness continue, if the higher authority will not to teach children to help society?Before all its power The United States of America has encountered so many things, it's the adult's job to teach the children of the future to not make the same mistakes and do what is right. 
Technology cannot be used to express humans feelins or emotions, even with what is installed in it. 
I believe that the Facial Action Coding System works perfectly good and does indentify humans expression like Dr. Haung said but not real emotion becasue the person can just be expressing some emotions but that doesn't mean they feeeling it that way.    
In paragrah one he is talking about how Venus is closely similar to Earth in size shae an mass by saying 
At most basic level it seems unfair because of the winner-take-all system. 
lets people take bikes, skates, and ect. and so people can be more actice, 
First of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school 
for example in the 2012 election, Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is very possible like the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. It is less likely to have a dispute over the popular vote but it is more likely to have a dispute over the electoral vote. In 2012's election voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing canidates- knowing they are going to decide the election. Causing the popualr vote to go up. When we as a community should not want to president be chosen by a popular vote but by the electoral vote, it is only fair! 
and limited learning variety online. 
On paragraph 4, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life" and"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valley's, moutains, and craters." Venus could had living forms living in their surface if Venus has any type of familiar features just like Earth. 
Imagine if you was looking in the mirror and you suggest an emotion can your lab partner recongize your emotion 
However, there is no way for them to remain home and keep up with schoolwork. This fear of being unable to attend school and still keeping up with their course load is one that plagues many students. Personally speaking, I can reference numerous students who have felt dangerously ill on school days, but were so afraid of missing tests and presentations that they still came. They felt that if they even missed one day, they would have missed salient lessons, causing their work to pile up, resulting in stress. Providing an alternate method for these students to learn, such as online classes, would have mitigated their concerns. This logic pertains to mental health as well. It is common knowledge that the mental health of adolescents in this generation is declining, and the most prominent reason is school. Online classes provide an avenue for students who feel their mental health is worsening to still receive an education but from a place of comfort, which is their home. 
Not all student would be able to take and online classes or a conference talk, because everybody want seat in class and see what the teacher is teaching them 
I'ts seen both ways but is there anything we can do about it? Good or Bad 
It used to be one of the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Which facsinated many Astronomers. Venus was probably covered by many bodies of water and forms of life could have been supported, just like Earth. The planet now has a rocky surface with many valley's, mountains, and craters that makes astronomers itch to further expore it. Despite it's very hard conditions to even get near the planet. 
This all could have been prevented if he just put his phone down and took you home safe and sound. 
Under the electoral college system, voters vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors ? They can be anyome not holding public office. Sometimes statee conversations, sometimes the presidential candidates themsleves. 
This makes things go on a simple flow. 
if you so much as enter the plant, the atmosphere it will crush you do to the tempature and the extreme conditions on the plant. 
The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election 
students will have more urge to do them 
Computers don't need to understand what humans feel because they don't have feelings. 
I think we should keep the Electoral College 
I am also in an extracurricular activity, 
Students that participate in extracurricular will exceed academy and will not go down a path of illegal activity 
I think this because if most students have a C then the team will have less people to support the team 
"Nevertheless on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Sureyor drew close enough for a second look. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view," said Garvin. "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 merterd per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." 
So this prosses sound like cool but it just show how much computer can do it not meaing it 100 right. 
some schools get to play with "D" average students that's not really fair as I think of it all . 
Maybe one day it will be like earth again. 
I think that yes if there was driverless cars that not just a couple people should have them everyone should 
The best part of being a Seagoing cowboy is helping people. 
During a presidential campaign, a political party will put most of their efforts in "swing states", these are the states with the most electors. This means that people from smaller states will recieve little or no information about the candidates causing the citizens to cast a blind vote. 
The reason why its better to change the vote because it is easier to vote for the president. 
Electoral college system sholud not be kept because its really not a vote. 
In Vauban, Germany  70 percent of their families do not own cars, and 57 percent saold a car to live here. people find it better to walk to places rather than having to use a vehicle. "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation America. The Environmental Protecton Agency is promothing "car reduced" communties. Delivery companies complained of lost revenus, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars. it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. In parks and sports centers their pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks. With all these changes, poeple who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyricketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with the telecommunities industry to create cities in which "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety." 
We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.                             
When students have cell phones they don't how to act with cell phones they act like wide animals when they have cell phones 
The author believes that Venus is special because , it's basically the "twin" of earth, which means they might have had life on the surface. 
it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president diectly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter. 
But there is also a problem when asking only one person. If you truly trust that person, but they don't give you good advice who are you gonna ask then. The only person you told your problem to was that one person, so you don't have multiple choices like when you ask multiple people. 
In the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars''NASA talks about how a spacecraft was circling the planet mars snapping possible landing sites for another spacecraft. When it suddenly spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face it seemed to be smiling back at the cameras. 
If a candidate only went to a place that has a lot of electoral votes and he knew those people were gonna pick for the Democrats then he basically has a huge advantage, 
First,I beileve they should not abolish it because its so origanal and whats the reason it needs to be abolished. 
While testing we figured out that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. 
I feel like if it was hard to find the perfect angle and measurements to take a closer look at the face, there could have been mistakes made without realization. 
I completely agree with the principals assignment and I would recommend to a lot of people that participating in an extra curricular activity would be a good thing. Extra curricular activities are fun, stress coping, and can improve life skills. Extra curricular activities can make it easier to suite your personal needs and help you get work done.Extra curricular activities can also be fun and interactive with other people. But the main thing to remember is that extracurricular activities are supposed to help with your needs.  
It is easier to go to school becuase we will learn the topic with other students and students can ask for help from their friends or the the teachers in class. 
I do mostly agree with you. If you really want something, you should try your hardest to aim for it. 
With our recent innovations, we will be able to see the next generations of students achieve a better education that gets increasingly accessible with the passage of time. It is becoming clear that the problem of missing education based off of things that students cannot control must be taken more seriously. Countless students are faced with circumstances that change every aspect of their learning experience, but we are now more able to counter these challenges than ever before. Despite the fact we have a long way to go to make sure students are given a perfect learning experience, problems associated with illness and moving could definitely be assisted with. Advancements in educational technologies will only occur with an abundant amount of care for the generations to come. Online schooling is a peek into our progressive education future. 
opinions, 
The article mentions that cameras might be needed to ensure people pay attention to the road. There are already enough distractions for drivers to worry about. Texting and driving has become a major issue in recent years. Imagine how easy it would be to be distracted by a phone or other device if the car you were in were driving itself? This is a slippery slope. It starts out with relatively small things, such as not paying full attantion to the road if the car drove itself. But soon, if people did not have to worry about traffic laws and safety, then they would soon forget them. Hypothetically speaking, what if someone who had been driving a driverless for a period of time one day had to go back to driving a regular one. This person may still have their liscense, but would they be able to pass a test for it now? Problems like this would make the road more dangerous than it already is. In addition, that same person who is now driving a regular car, may forget that he or she is controlling the car, being that they were so used to the car driving itself. There is enough reckless driving, that we do not nead people operating vehicles with no memory of how to do it! Or people might even neglect to learn how to drive a regular car at all if they depended on a driverless car all the time. If society allowed this to happen, the results could be catastrophic. 
Students could join a extracurricular activity because they need a hobby 
It has about the same density and size compared to earth. In the article it states in paragraph 4 that "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth." This quote helps state that it is a interesting planet and alike Earth they want to study and learn about it knowing the conditons. 
The Founding Fathers used it when they were alive. I think that America is a little past that, because that was three hundred years ago. Why still use something that old? It is pretty irrational to still use the electoral college. 
In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. 
Then when it comes time to fairly make their votes for us,the people who voted ,They can change their minds if they like an vote for the least liked canidate running for office by Florida is they wanted too! Thats ridicoulous and has no justice.The winner takes all system is very faulty and unfair. 
Driverless cars are in our near futrue. Cars like these need to have protection for everybody. I like the idea of that they are trying to make them, trying to make them smater, and trying to make smater roads for us to drive them on too 
A lot of the time, this is overlooked, or simply ignored, as it is often stigmatized. Conditions such as anxiety and depression are common examples, and stress will simply exacerbate one's symptoms. Such things would make attending school extremely difficult for some students. Being able to do coursework at home would likely alleviate the problems they were having before, allow for improvement, and later success. Other things that people don't always think about, or may even look down upon, is treatment and recovery. Relapse, tragedy, etc would be common examples as well. Being able to do courses online might be the best option for someone that wants to take time off to get better, and return to school once they're ready. In conclusion, people face situations that others might not even think about, and so they shouldn't be stripped of an option that would ultimately be best for them. 
If a student also doesn't do their homework you may ask that person to be a teacher in another school full of kids that don't do their homework, so the kid would fell the same way the teachers fell when some of their students don't do their homework. 
People should be able to use their phones while their driving, but at the same time they should not be able to use their phone at all. 
Our school should continue to require students to participate in extracurricular activities because it provides balance in their schedules, 
it prohibits new learners from driving the correct way. 
I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. 
The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of of electors, who in turn elect the president. 
Each year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the United States. Many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. This means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. There is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. Stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 17-30 years of age. In a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty shocking reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.
Everyday, in the world people are corrupted by the following: losing their jobs, a natural disaster may put them out of their homes, and even just a problem with finances. When some of those people lost everything, they literally lost ever thing except for maybe the clothes on their back and the pride that may have been shattered 
For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The "Seagoing Cowboys" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson. 
and now there making technology that reads emotional expressions. 
One of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck. 
it can be a opportunity for students to become more social and make new friends, 
another reason is medical problems or other forms of illness. 
A lot of people are going to say a lot of different things about your situation. This gives you more options to make a better choice in the end. The more options you have, the more possibilities there are and then choose the one you think is best. It also gives you the opportunity to use the process of elimination for options you don't consider to be helpful. This can help for any situation you may be in. 
one of them being the similarities which they can see from far distance the planet has to earth. the author says Venus is often referred to as the earths twin due to the size, mountain like, and believed to have many oceans and waterways making venus very simlar to the earth. with venus being the closest planet as well to the earth having a closer distance to venus from earth. 
In addition,i am not saying that theElectoral College is right in everything becauseElectoral College has its difficulties too,just like choosing the popular vote for the President. for example 
Some people don't believe in alien lifeforms on other planets; they would say, other planets can't support life there due to multiple things: no oxygen, water, food, etc. We scientist respond to this with, "We have all those things here, there has to be some other planet like us." 
Back to the car example, lets say someone told the teacher that the car they wanted to buy was a bad choice. However, the teacher disagreed with him and she told him something that was completely incorrect. Others would be able to point this out and make sure that the information she found was 100% true and that her research does not have any false information that could affect her final decision. This allows someones information to be more accurate. 
In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. 
We want to have a president that believes in what we believe in. 
In the end, the rule should be passed and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity.  
Atronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well may once have been the most earth like planet in our soloar system''. 
I say important to me because If I asked the people in the office if I could use the phone to ask my mom or a parent something, and did not tell them why because it was a personal question, they would normally say "no". 
As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school. 
People who has a cell phone shouldn't use it when they have to study because that is just waste of time and you will get bad grades. 
Moreover, classroom learning promotes comradery and friendships. Having friends in class makes learning more appealing and interesting. For example, debates and seminars develop critical thinking skills since other students can have a different, challenging perspective to share amongst each other about a topic; this causes them to respect each others opinions and promotes communication skills. 
A few years later, another satellite took pictures about 10 times sharper and clearer. But in this picture, the so called mask just looked like a normal everyday landform. The media was not happy with this picture. But this picture did show proof that there was just a landform just like on Earth, that was nothing special. Even one of NASA's global surveyor said that there are landforms on Mars just like on Earth. 
Motorized vehicles have put a tole on our environment, our well being, and our wallets. 
Is the Electoral College fair and right? This system is composed of the selection of the electors, the meeting of electors, and the counting of congress 
If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion. 
In the event that only Texas, Florida and, California voted yes and the rest of the country voted no, The vote would be no.  
we will feel depended on and we will most likely feel thankful. We will feel good about ourselves and we will want to participate in more activities to help our community. 
maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not. 
In the article it sais that googles Toyota Prius are assisted with ''position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearveiw mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.'' 
Most teachers want their students to be excited for their class. Even if the class course is torturous, a teacher who loves their job can make all the difference in the world. If a teacher gives their students the freedom of creating their own summer project, the students will have a good image of the teacher. Students that enjoy a class tend to be the ones who do the best. Most teenagers don't enjoy being tied down by rules, so getting them excited for a class that has rules is the ideal situation. 
If the technology could be used with just a webcam then you could just look at your students face and see if they are bored or off task and make the lesson more enjoyable. We could just look at the precentages of the kids facial expressions like how they found out how the Mona Lisa's smile was mostly happy. 
One way to get that variable out of the way is to as more that one person. 
There are many aspects to learning and education that is different for all students. Some people are naturally gifted in certain areas, and others may struggle in that same area. Nevertheless, everyone learns at a different pace, and it can't be expected for everyone to flourish in the same environment. 
There is also number 4 where the Electoral College "restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution" 
it is always beneficial for you to consider a different perspective. 
However, some drivers may still respond to a text message and that is why many of the accidents occurs and most of the time this lead to a vehicle accident that could lead to death.Drivers need to understand how easily it is to take someone life or themselves.Everyday people are risking their lives due to the high rate of cell phone use while operating a vehicle.Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are a distraction to drivers while their on the road.Because of their conversation they might get upset and this could lower their driving ability that can lead them to lose control over the car.If people don't make the right decision and put their cell phone away while driving their routine could harm innocent people. 
The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. 
Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone. 
This example shows that they might of seen something else such as the face ,but it could be wrong because they captured the picture when there was wispy clouds. 
NASA has discovered many incredible supernatural things, but they do not believe any of these situations was caused by the existance of aliens 
I do not think that the Electoral College is doing anything harmful or bad so I think that there is no reason to get rid of it 
Driverless cars are much more efficient. 
The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer. Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax. If students make their own projects they could make it very simple. Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school. If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot. When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it. To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break. 
The artcile talks about finding the emotions of one of the most world wide known paintings in the world, the Mona Lisa. We could find out people emotions from years ago, dating back from the first detailed paintings. This could also work on not just paintings, but old photos. Imagine seeing what emotions people had in pictures from World War 1 or other wars. Seeing this could bring a new sight into history. 
There's no electors invovled causing you to fall in doubt. 
Popular vote is a much better system than the Electoral College because unlike the Electoral College, it is actually fair for its citizens. America, which has suffered greatly to acheieve equality and liberty is held back by one thing-- the Electoral College. This is suffered by the United States' citizens because of the College's winner-take-all system. 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
The study of life on Venus would have many hard obstacles to overcome and look deeper into. " 
In the article, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", it is stated that in Vauban Germany, 70 percent of families do not own vehicles. The other 30% that do, do not have a place to park them, making them basically useless. Residents in Vauban have stopped their need for transportation, making malls and stores a walk away. In this new approach, pollution has drastically reduced in numbers and has made it a much safer and cleaner place to live. 
Also, the Electoral College ensures the presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal. It makes the votes count, the president chose is surely, "Everyone's President, 
According to some authors it would be a great way to engage the public and bring some attention to Mars. 
I believe that people will start sueing companies and people will not feel confortable of being stalked while driving. 
In conclusion the new computer software is a great creation which could help with computer animation and video surgery. But shouldn't be allowed to be used for ads, to make people but stuff based off there emotions. 
In October Generic_Name missed two weeks of school because he had the flu and couldnt leave his bed but if he would have had online classes he could just have done them from home and not have had his grades impacted so severely. Like many others Generic_Name had become sick and had to miss school and many assignments if he would have been able to do his classes online There would have been little to no impact. If more schools would pick up online schooling there would not be incidents like this anymore. Generic_Name recently got back from a trip to France with his family and unfortunately was infected with COVID-19 ( Coronavirus) and now he will have to miss an extended period of school and be quarantined meaning he cant receive an education, But if he could do his work online he would be able to continue to receive an education while quarantined. This being a much more serious scenario of missing school that as of right now schools should start to take into consideration, none the less having online school would solve one of the problems this child is facing. Both of these students could have their grades remain intact if there was online schooling. In conclusion there would be no more need for sick days if when a student is sick they can just work from home. 
If they want to pick up trash, it should be because they want to and not because they have to 
Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. It's extremely dangerous in horrified accidents. 
In conclusion many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but say is a natural landform. Some people may have counter calims first counter claim is why would NASA lie to us. Second counter claim is that the picture showed a face so it is a face. Third counter claim is that they had a good camera so if it shows it then it is a face. My rebuttals would be that NASA is not lieing about the pictures. Second the picture might create an illusion that makes you think it's a face. Third not all cameras show exactly what you want to take a picture of these are my counter claims and rebuttals and also my example and explanantions 
often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves . 
Dear senator i was wondering what the electoral college was. 
And thisw concludes all the stuff in my essay if Venus is a worthy pursuit to study about Yes i think it is because you could be learning more than others about Venus. 
If the eclectoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting? 
The Electoral College may have been in better use for the past but now it is the future and we need better ways for voting. We need to go back and use popular vote instead of Electoral College. 
NowI will conclude my reasons on why people should seek multiple opinions to help them later on. So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something.     
It would be better to have them at use in school because than students that want to learn can and the students that don't want to learn repeat the same classes until they pay attention enough to pass there class. 
Just imagine if the track and field area had no litter at all, if there were multiple trash cans instead of three or four, or even helping make a second loop to pickup children. But see not all children might be able to participate as needed because either they are too little, have a sport, have a doctors appointment or even be allergic to the material your working with. If you do decide to put this club into action Tuesday and Thursday right after school would probably be the most effective and convenien 
Those photos show and just make the picutre seem like it is forming real life aliens, but that is just how the photo was shot 
Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America 
Assuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? 
my second reason is some people dont care about who they vote for, 
First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. 
Hve you ever been in an argument before? 
An example is in the 2012 election, when Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral votes, while Romney recieved 51.3 percent of popular votes. 
12 out of 12 students will not regret making the choice of doing community service 
The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people(source 3). When you vote for a presidental candidate youre actually voting for a slate of electors 
The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life. I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are. 
Paragraph 7 has no claims on how you should go to Venus whatsoever, but instead it is talking about older tech used in the 1800s. 
Without a physical building to meet in everyday many extracurriculars lack the funds to rent out a separate property and would quickly fold. Even students that were invested in an after school activity before a switch to online schooling occurred would face the difficulty in their ability to travel to the new meeting place of their activity. Many students do not have access to a car, either for financial or legal reasons (they do not have a license yet), so busing is the only way these students are able to travel to and from the school. With online schooling this busing would no longer be consistent and many after school activities would see huge drops in participation or fold entirely. This would be detrimental to the students who any have the talents to successes in other activities outside of the school. This would limit the opportunities students have causing the diversity of experiences the rising generation would have. 
Some people have a hard time realizing what the Electoral College is even doing for our society. Me included. 
Do something good for school is good because when they gave you advice to do the right thing is class. For example the gym teacher gave you advice to do the right not the bad advice because if you do the bad thing you will get a bad grade and get in trouble. When we get in trouble is bad and you always have to listen when they gave us advice for you do well at your test. When we do well in our test is because the teacher was having us advice and we were paying attecion. 
The Electoral College is not a fair process. It worked in the past, but not anymore. Using the popular vote process is more fair for all of the people. They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events. 
Athletes will have to cut practices short because they have to do community service, thus for not allowing them to become better at their sport. 
distance learning would cause major problems to students and destroy the positive developments the current education system has encourage. 
School is a place where students are supposed to be able to learn information and grow as human beings. The main problem with school being a place where students must commute to, is that for some of the students, the environment just isn't the right place for them to learn 
Some days i think we all need to sothing besides going home and doing noting. 
By justifying why it is crucial to continue our efforts to explore Venus, and additionally through their explanation as to how this can safely be accomplished, the author of this article strongly supports their idea that studying Venus is a noble pursuit despite the many obstacles that it creates. 
We cannot always control  the elector and who might he choose thas way 
If you make SCHOOL_NAME students perform community service, I can guarantee that not only SCHOOL_NAME, but our school will be a much better place. 
discover the consequences the choices you have 
people ask for others opinions all the time, when people ask for more than one opinion its to make a better judgment of what they're asking. 
Kids need to start being more happy and play sports and enjoy life 
Say if they have trouble in school, try to help them with there grade's, or maybe the lost a love one. I would convince other to support me because i listen to people about what wrong or if there going thought something. I care about people feelings and i won't say anything in till there done.Why do i want to do this is because say if your mom,dad,granddad, or grandma die in a car crush wouldn you be upset because that's your family member or maybe they die of the corona would you be upset you would want a councilor, brother, or sister. What i'm trying to say is that people need a council to help them out. Ok say that a truck smash your house wouldn't you be in shock in that case you would need a council right.What i trying to say is that i want people to support me to do what i want to do, like say i want to help people out through family problem or like a love one die of cancer, heart attack, car crush, etc. I would be there to help them through there problem. it would be my honor to help people out. 
Its not a landform 
Yes, it was cloudy to and that could have caused some major differnces comapred to when it is sunny. The "alien markings could have been hidden by haze" 
People often ask whats wrong with the electoral college? ''Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president'' 
think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone. 
To continue, the FACS technology would help students be more emotionally stable. 
Oline schools would make a big change in those kids lifes in a positive way.  
And the electoral collage is just not fair. 
Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters (12). 
Throughout my years in school I never once did a summer project that I was truly interested in. Most projects made us read a certain book and summarize it in some unique way. Every summer, one after another, we did the same type of project. Over and over again, reading a book and summarizing it. Those projects started to get boring and some summers I didn't even do them. Students never got a choice with anything. We didn't get to choose what project we did, we didn't get to choose if we worked with a group, we didn't even get to choose what book we did our report on. 
I once heard, "necessity is the mother of invention." This quote is indicating that when their is high demand for something, or if someone is wondering how or why something works, new inventions and innovations are made. When considering projects, the same rule applies; questioning what you are interested in yields innovation that have built this country since day one. For example, Bill Gates wouldn't have founded Microsoft is he didn't research and look into what he was interested in. 
Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. 
It could be argued that public schools are cheaper and that they can supervise younger children for free while allowing parents to work 
it is really hard to keep up with your grades, and school and other important things students may have to do outside of school. 
A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. "Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg." The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting "car reduced" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane."President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week." American now is has fewer car sales, people driving less, and there are fewer and fewer liscences each year. Americas love of motor vehicles seems to be subsiding. People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike. 
Next,this has gone on for centry's its in our constitution thank's to our founding fathers (source 1) 
Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean. 
To begin, In the source 2 they state the following "60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." 
This cannot represent the will of the people. 
The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote. 
i can hear them talking about what i was talking about to my sister in the office. Well some of the things that i said where personal, not only to me but to my sister. 
Students can get creative with their art and that could inspire others no matter how hard it might get. They could push themsleves to get out of their comfort zone and this could lead them to have bigger oppoutunties. Students getting the chance to do their own project could make them follow through with it. 
After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election. 
The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa. 
i don't know u might have a lot of new students if some things change . Everyone might listen or they will not listen at all we might get sent to the principals office. 
Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time. 
What is community service without the positive attitude to help somebody out? Instead of having this positive attitude in your students, what you'll receive is a bunch of poor attitudes and the bare minimum of effort. 
Luke said that the day in pacific war ended they got there seaman's paper's and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for greece. 
the students get an opportunity to do the things they like, that they may not have the opportunity to do at school or at home. 
the last reason Electoral College should be abole to vote is that they dont have all the controle 
Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it 
precise driving capabilities, 
There is no point of teachers using this machine 
The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do. 
The scientists compared the face to the Snake River Plain of Idaho because of how similar they are. They are similar in a way because of the isolated messa, height, and landforms. 
it makes the candidates work harder to becaome president. 
For example, when people were voting for Obama or Romney, Obama had the most popular votes. That shows that the citizens trusted Obama in representing our country. They liked what his plans were going to be and trying to help us with our problems. 
Moreover, students need more intense requirement for self-direction because you have to know study online is good or bad for you. 
My principal has decided for all students would have to participate in one extrarricular activity. 
An example is if a person who murdered somebody and nobody knew if he was being honest or not, the machine can read his emotions and has a better chance to tell if the person is lying or not. It can be used for celebritys and politician as said in the article. This can identify many human being feelings and it doesnt take to much time. 
Firstly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it has failed to elect a President in the past. 
They took a lot of photos of it. But that don't mean its a face. NASA figered it out that it was a landfrom the have a very good camira 
Summer projects are a tool to help a teacher, having them designed around the teacher's plans will allow each teacher to know where each student is and know where to focus most in the curriculum. 
Even though Venus has harsh conditions that humans are not able to survive on, there are still technological avdvances that could lead us to exploring or living on the planet. Most scientists are curious of new things even if they can not physically study it in which the, "Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." such as Venus. The conditions of Venus will not stop scientists or researchers from trying to gather more and more information of Venus. The study of Venus could be an oppertunity to a whole new world. There are ways and technological ways that will allow humans to live on Venus but it just has not been discovered yet. 
First, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because schools create a good environment for face-to-face help 
There are also ways students can benefit from online education in the future. One benefit is that the student will be more independent. 
they are mistaken. 
because they ride bikes everywhere and walk alot, and theres no pollution so theres probably people who dont have breath in nasty air of cars. Even the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are even starting to do the same. 
Many students want to do sports and many don't, and some just don't care. 
taking some one 's cars away will hurt some people 's feeling and this idea sound good to me because some teenagers keep making some fast cars and racing in the streets and there  is some time most of them got their self killed or burning a life in the car if they can especially take those cars away it will be more safeand tey will stop dying in cars accident. 
see their point of view 
this would put to much power in the hands of the school. 
The Electoral College has five hundred thirty eight electors. Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives. Not only does each candiddate running for president have their own group of electors, but you will get two of your own. 
if there is a way to keep it, we can use it if there is a tie between the Presidency voting. 
Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year. 
Getting advice from different people is helpful most of the time except when they all say the same thing but you do not agree with it. Asking multiple people gives you choices and I do not know about you but I like to have many different choices. Some people might give you bad advice and other people might give you good advice and thats why you should ask multiple people for advice. If you ever need advice your parents are most likely that best people to go to depending on the problem. Your parents are almost always right for relationship advice and friend advice. But if you get a pet ask the vet.     
Some activities that students are able to participate in are sports, yearbook committee, student council, and helping out with the environment 
Imagine growing up in a city 30 miles above the ground and wearing a suit all the time to protect yourself from the envirement. This is life on the planet of Venus. There are many dangers such as the temperature being 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth, and clouds of sulfuric acid everywhere but is it worth it? 
because its the peoples choice 
I am not against the vaule of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. 
Schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conferencing. 
In conculsion, the authors idea might sound a bit bazzar, but it is not a bad idea. Since the planet a while ago was like earth, still looks like earth, and it is the closest to earth. So maybe in a couple of years NASA might finale make a plantery vist. 
If the students are detracted form what they need to do, that eventually leads to bad grades, not a good job and worse lack of education, and with these present days, it is mandatory to have a good education. 
Listening to another person's opinions can open your mind to the different ways of doing something. It can also help some people to grow as a person and be able to take their own advice.In order to get the most well rounded advice a person must ask a variety of different people. Often times someone will only ask one person for advice, making their point of view limited. They are only getting one opinion, and aren't able to see how other people interpret what they want to know. 
I'm not sure how you could make everyone do community service because some students have after school activities and you can't make them stop for other people. 
I have some friends that are too busy to be doing community service because they have jobs or are taking care of siblings. Please do not require us to do it there are many people that don't want to . 
Allowing a car to be responsible for one person's life is not the best decision, and should be thought out more accordingly, than just seeing it as a fun toy because our laziness is growing so much, that we can't even drive for ourselves. 
Summer is the time to relax and unwind from the stresses of the school year. It's a time of mornings spent sleeping in, afternoons laying out by the pool, and nights sleeping on the roof, counting the stars that gleam in the sky. That is why students look forward to summer break. As a result, schools should not contribute in reversing the association students make between summer break and enjoyment by assigning teacher-designed projects. With the intention of continual learning occurring over summer break, schools should allow projects to be student-designed. It gives students the chance to explore their passions and make new discoveries without any limitations. Teacher-designed projects only serve in holding students back from doing projects that truly hold meaning to them. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the most logical decision schools can make is having summer projects that are student-designed. This will allow students to have a good time in both the academic and non-academic part of their summer break.  
Using the heads-up system is a good idea 
60% of people would prefer that a direct election be held. 
Humans lose attention on the roads, develope road rage, and brake the law frequently. These are all things that could lead to a fatal crash. For example, "Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own." Drunk driving will also become a thing of the past and save more lives than anyone could even imagine. A driver less car can also utilize some of the cars capabilities that a human can not access. "The information from the sensors can cause the car ti apply brakes on individual and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. 
There are many different things to do which means that there is something for everyone. Having the opportunity to be participating in something you enjoy will make you happier. It has been proven that when you're happier, you have lower stress levels. When asked, 9 out of 10 students said that they felt stressed by school often. An extracurricular activity is a great way to relieve some of that stress. By participating in something you enjoy and something you chose to do, you'll be able to improve your skills, which can give you a sense of accomplishment and happiness. These are just some of the benefits of an extracurricular activity. 
Spending resources on studying planets is a good and a bad. 
Schools offering online classes to students would be a grand benefit to all students, and could make a profound impact on their learning and their grades. 
When talking to different people about your problem, each of them will conjure very different solutions 
So in my owns i think what was stated means it should be a tradition and it should stay as a tradition in the American culture 
students may begin to stress. 
Hi my names Kaigen and I am against the idea of self driving vehicles. 
it'll give students a chance to make the project chill, 
Some other ones would be that some students will do it just to act up in that class 
So I urgue you senator to help us citizens toi change the way the voting process is set up so we can understand who we are voting for and help us make a fair choice so our vote can stand for something. 
Since the invention of automobiles, cars have become a neccessity in the world. They have shaped our society today and are used by virtually anyone you see nowadays. However, car usage has had its toll on many aspects of our life today. Some places in the world have even gone as far to ban cars to promote a better lifestyle 
But, immersing them in an environment that encourages social interaction would be a more ideal situation as they would be able to learn how to overcome their anxiety; there are more effective, and less drastic measures that can be taken to help a student with social anxiety as opposed to taking them out of the classroom setting altogether and replacing them with online settings. 
However in class, they are to be silenced and put away! There are many reasons for this policy. It also helps the kids not get in trouble as much. Students mostly get in trouble for texting in class. 
They should always use the Electoral college because it wouldn't be fair if they went by the population of a state, just the simple fact that some states are more populated than other. 
I think you should allow students to have cell phones in school. 
For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. 
Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it alllows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. 
what the pcture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a messa which are landforms around the American West. 
This technology will help out students more then ever and is to valuable to pass up and should be in every classroom posible 
I think the policy should allow us to have cell phones. There are certain reasons why. 
These students want the power this time and the choice to choose what they want to do. They want to be able to pick the subject that they are interested in and pursue it, this time with nothing and no one in their way. 
This process is fair and essential because it is is not the only determination 
the elctoral college is unfair, outdated,and irrational. so thats why i would not choise elctoral vote. 
So they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it . On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look . When they had did they a pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters , they image was not a face anymore it was really Martain equivalent of a butte or masa . It reminds me of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. " 
Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board. 
The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great oppertunity to help those in need to recover their food supplies. 
Material that has been researched by the student and completed on their own has been proven to show greater results in the grade attached to the project. When an assignment has been handed to a student to complete that has been created by someone else, they are likely only to do the minimum of what has been assigned. By doing this they are not able to gain full knowledge of the topic and fully understand what is going on 
Teacher-designed summer projects prepare students for the course by ensuring that they know important background information that will help them succeed later in the year. 
Although, relating to each other when creating these projects is a great thing, some students will think otherwise. Some students will say that they enjoy the summer assignments that teachers give and don't want students to take that away. 
Summer projects need to be student-designed 
These facts lead to the evidence is many ways 
In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author explained many reasons why would should explore venus such as,Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans. The author was giving nonfact statements to support his claim of why we should explore venus. Another statement the author statment said venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visits which is not a fact 
The student's would also get a feel of how other student's our in they might even make a new freind's. 
By asking multiple people for advice or an opinion you will receive helpful bits of information along the way 
Attending classes at home would mean they have the option to start thier classes at a later time assuring that they can sleep in in the morning to get the extra few hours they're missing out on. 
To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'. 
Many have suggested this idea to go on. It would be good for the safety of the people on the roads. 
The biggest problem here is that we (america) are so much more advanced then the system we have right now. Over 200 years later and were still using the same system. 
Have you ever through of somethig simple in life like studying venus. 
Some students may be too immature and just give up on these projects, teachers are the ones who are going to grade these projects. So, teachers should decide what they want to grade as it'll be more organized and specified. Also some may say that students are still to young to know what they are doing and may end up doing something that they did not think twice about. 
One simple, yet extremly effective way to reduce pollution is limiting the transportation methods we travel by. 
Since you person can say one someone else another. Lets take the career choice example since one person said to become a doctor and the other a nurse. With those opinion it helps you decide what to do. You could become a nurse then see if you like the job or if not then you could go back to school and get your education to become a doctor. 
Like if someone has 5 candidacies and they ask each person separately a majority of the candidates will have different answers. So, if someone has both of the same answers then the person who is asking will probably lean more to the similar answers. Just because the people go towards that answer doesn't mean that it is logical. 
they do elect fairly  the bigger thye state you have the mor represenatives you recive, 
After this program he said "it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." 
I'll start off by saying that Electoral College is unfair to voters. 
In conclusion I believe humans could live on Venus unless It orbits too close to the sun it could get to hot. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dnagers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Would you want to live on Venus with the high tempatures and low air pressure? 
This is one of the reasons students are inclined to come to school everyday. At least for me, one of the reasons why I enjoy attending school is because I get to see my friends. Due to homework and other extracurricular activities, school is the main place where I get to catch up with my friends; it is what makes going to school more interesting. Having friends at school can allow students to work together on the same assignments or school projects. Team based learning allows for all students to contribute to one task and work together in a way that will result in a good grade. 
During school holidays, teachers are unable to assign work or projects to students because their breaks are dedicated to leaving ones mind at rest. Though students are unable to receive work over short-term breaks, work over the summer is optional for most teachers. While a break from constant learning is needed for the mind to repair itself, stopping all academic thought can effect the students recovery back into their new school term. Summer assignments most often consist of a short paper or vocabulary words needed for the upcoming year, all achievable within a couple weeks. Not only does being able to accomplish such little work in such a large amount of time show responsibility but it also prepares the student for larger sums of upcoming work. 
You get free breakfeast every morning. There will be eggs,panacakes,bacon,sausage and more. If you join this month you will get a free trip to the next place we go. On the boat there is a pool,and there is a hot tub. The pool and hot tub closes at 10:00. 
That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You don't get to travel to places for free very often. Luke Bomberger had the chance to go to many different countries and see many different things in those countries. 
Distance learning is one of the best tools that could be used for those who need it. Life is full of bumps and turns that some do not always expect. These bumps and turns can take students out of the classroom and cause them to fall behind their peers. Stress and loss of the drive to learn are linked, and can be seen in any classroom no matter where. Throughout the years, technology has grown and evolved. Instead of complaining about the evolution of technology, teachers and parents should be able to embrace it, and the tools that it brings students. Distance learning has many more benefits than downsides and downfalls. More schools should implement it, to adjust and accommodate to the students' needs, instead of the students having to adjust their needs for the school system. 
the electoral college is an unreliable way to elect the president 
In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters.In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues. One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape. 
The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. 
We should be changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. 
Imagine a world where instead of going to school, you could stay at home everyday and not face the burden of waking up early to make it to your first period class on time. Sounds like a fantasy, right? This could become a reality if you choose to participate in distance learning and take your classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However, the question is whether or not this system would be efficient in educating students, and if students benefit from being able to attend classes from home. 
Hopefully it would change your mind about this policy. 
also we don't want to repeat the 2000 fiasco agein and the system allows much worse 
As soon as we saw it everyone directly assummed it was created by aliens. 
You could try things that you usually wouldnt try when you are staying at home playignvideo games and watching netflix in your room. 
The principal decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity which includes sports, working on the yearbook, and serve on the student council. Do I agree or disagree with this. 
students are more likely to understand how to do the project if they are able to design it. 
Third example has pathos catching peoples feelings or making them think being put into someone els shoes. 
This immediatly shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's super-power? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote- a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. 
With more freedom students can explore subjects that they don't know about, or want to know more about. This can also make students get more creative with the project when it comes to design or topic that others may find interesting. If students had more freedom with their project allowing them to be creative and showing the teachers what they can do could benifit them because the teacher can give the student more opportunities when doing future projects. Also if the school some very creative project than the student can be recommended to events or major schools in the future. Also when giving students more freedom it can allow them to express themselves or maybe make a point when doing a project on their own. Also when doing a teacher-designed project then students will fell more restrained and more like they are forced to a project. If students had to do their own designed project than they would probably do it more willingly. 
What's the difference its just a camera 
Did you know that texting and driving is more dangerous then drunk driving. 
people would seek out multiple people, 
Each expression is compared aganist a neutral face (showing no emotion). this explain how advance technology can be .We as humans practice on this same impressive evey day . For example we can tell if our freind or families are upset . 
The face on mars is a natural landformation. People beleive it was made by aliens but it was not 
The principles decision makes kids do something that they will most likely actually really enjoy, something that will very much assist them in getting into college, and something that will allow students to understand how to survive in the real world. It will also benefit my high school and any college any current student at my school goes to in the future. In conclusion, the decision to make all students required to do an extracurricular activity was a fantastic one. 
Imagine a lost, confused version of yourself. Perhaps it's an essay, a project, or a personal situation that has you conflicted. You have no idea what to do or what to think of. You are stuck. The first thing that pops into your head is to consult your peers, but not just one. 
Learning from home can benefit students 
People have to know when to take a break. Students throughout the school year have been taught many things by teachers which we are very grateful for. 
The good thing about asking one person is you don't have to really worry about them going around telling that much people about your problem 
Well i have expressed my opinion on the Cell Phone Policy and now it is up the school. And i hope you go back and read the story clear because their are reasonable explanations for the reasons for cell phone use. 
Because of the winner takes all in each state. ''Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly asserrtions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at times at best. Its hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the elctoral college!''. 
When people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation. 
because students will never put interest in what the need to do. 
Another good idea would be to have a meeting with parents and teachers and see what they think of this 
Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. 
Have you ever wondered what the electoral college is? If you answered no I would say me to, but in this essay im going to explain why i am for it. I havent heard of the electoral college till now. So sit back and read this. 
This how I feel about the Facial Action Coding System. 
Distance learning would allow long-term home bound students to learn alongside their peers, even if they are unable to physically attend school. 
An issue that should be brought up also, is that none of the developed vehicles have been completely driverless. 
Another  reason why you should change the voting rules is that the Electoral College doesnt even work 
people need to have driverless because it is the next big thing! 
During our time means that we will bother no one and do what we feel is fun, just like you would do what you want on your free time. Cell phones will cause no harm to your school , should they be put away properly. 
Venus are acid rain, 800 defrees fahrenheit and has only 3% of oxygen and 97% carbon dioxide. "Astronomers are fasinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in out solar system. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth." 
There are a lot of astronauts in NASA that are willing to take on the challenge to Venus and NASA has already been simulatiing prototypes to withstand the conditions similar to Venus 
It develops compassion and kindness in people. It helps them realize that the place they live in is important to them and to other people. 
It's quite simply one vote makes one person win the presidentcy. 
This is something that will be able to read your face and let people know if your bored, tired, happy, sad, and it even shows your fears. If your stuggling on a test or an assignment it will give you help and walk you through some of the problems. This would help many students understand the concept and test scores would be so much higher. 
I believe that it would be a good policy if students followed this policy, though most student don't follow most of the rules in school anyways. 
Regarding robots, I wonder if Baymax from Disney's "Big Hero 6" had something like it. 
While students are away they can miss out on valuable information and notes, and can be left behind with nothing to look back on. Generic_Name was out sick while his math class took notes but he used the classes from home site to stay tuned with his class and was able to take notes with the rest of the class even when he wasnt physically there. Since Generic_Name did that he didnt fall behind and stayed right with his classmates and when he returned he knew exactly what to do and had all the notes to help him with his classwork. Also Generic_Name took time to do further research on his computer on the subject and got more information and scored the highest in his class. Attending classes from home can be a waist of valuable time and can keep people from doing what they want to do 
Evening star"is what they call Venus. The nickname gaive the rung idea of Venus. Peolpe where misstaking that Venus is a star. Venus it's a own plant. In the text says "Venus is the second plant from our sun." In phragraph one. Reserchers study Venus becouse backthen is was closer to earth. Dispise of Venus bing dangers. Reserchers what to fide out if it still hase some earth fechers. 
One reason I would disagree is because some people are just way to busy and if principle makes them do an extracurricular activity that might cause stress to them and that could be adding more to their schedule which would be a struggle to maintain all of work I may have to do already especially as child . 
It would be unfair to disregard this opportunity from civilians as the right to vote and not give them the chance to prove themselves on whats right for them. This actually improves presidential votes,meaning that electors are recommended to do the responsibilities that the state laws vary 
I would not want a computer telling people, or evem myself, what mood i am in. 
Since every student is different, every student benefits with the power to work at their own pace. 
Of course some students wouldn't like that, 
For example some of the other students parents may not allow their kids to do community service because they probably have chores at home. 
To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day 
They only sent it out to attract attention to NASA. When it did it got way to out of control. 
Other thing that you can do is to tell the people that want to help to came in the afternoon then tell them to tell their friends to came that you will give them an extra grade. 
In many countries most children do not have a choose of whether or they want to up out the community. But, if u look at those children from other countries they are all responsible, and know how to act in public. Not saying all Americans are bad but, that we take things for granted. 
Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a state for electors, who in turn elect the president. The main problem with this is that most of the time voters are oblivious to who their electors vote for. In some cases, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whome ever they please... The states pick the electors that vote for us citizens.Sometimes the president doesn't even get the most popular vote, but they recieve enough electoral college votes, is this system a scam? 
The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. 
The author mentions that no spacecraft has survived on Venus: "...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours" (The Challenge 2). Since these missions have been unmanned, there is not much loss except for the spacecraft itself, but if there had been a human aboard, the loss would be tremendous and nothing would be gained from the mission. The conditions of Venus simply will not allow manned missions for closer examination of the planet. 
I think the author in this passage described Venus well. 
In stead of just getting rid of the Electoral voting system maybe we should tweek it in a bit that makes everyone happy and makes it completly fair. Each state picks how it gives its Electoral votes, but in most states its a "winner takes all." When a state desides its going to be a "winner takes all" state, that means when voting all the Electoral votes will go to the canidate with the most amount of elector votes. Instead of using the winner takes all system each electoral votes should be given fairly. When electors votes for its canidates by the people that single Electoral vote should go to that canidate. When doing this people are in-tern voting for there canidate. 
The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. "... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators..." (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. "The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes." (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom. 
Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, 
more opinions is better than one 
Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what. To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped. 
electoral college may cauge trouble, it may mess up the system,   
We've all seen the stereotypical depiction of education in today's society. Classes upon hallways upon schools of mindless zombies who've been bombarded with unfulfilling tasks, which demoralizes their sense to learn. Why should summer projects further foster this reality into summer vacation? Isn't the point of summer break to allow students to have time to themselves? Education is a crucial institution in America, however we must not mistake it for being the only source of learning. Learning is a life skill that ascends the classrooms and school hallways, and enters the hearts of students throughout this nation. To allow students the chance to dictate their own project gives them empowerment to extend curiosity and discovery to outside the classroom. Having done project based learning in school, I can undoubtedly state that the monotonous nature of school deprives students our freedom to learn without restrictions. Of course the material must be covered, the criteria and standards must be met and the exams must be taken, but summer time is different. Summer time should be the students' time, therefore permitting student-designed projects gives students the freedom to learn unrestricted without the monotone school structure. 
Online classes, with their isolated environment, cause students to lack the same interaction and attention they recieve at school everyday. 
With the electoral college we would avoid run-off elections 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
Therefor others of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. 
according to the reading in paragraph 7 while looking in the mirror rise your lips at. The corners of your mouth is decribing you reaction to your face. Then squint your eyes slightly to produced wrinkling, Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks of your cheeck up, torward you eyes. 
The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) machine developed by Dr. Paul Eckman is turning the tides of facial expression recognition. 
Spending time in the community just a few times a month would teach hard work, how to work well with others, and how in order to be able to take you have to give back. Also how to accept differences, because everyone you meet wont be the same as you are, or think the same as you might. 
why is its not disrupting class 
Almost all students love Summer vacation. But this time out of school is also a major halt in leaning. This halt can cause students to fall out of the rhythm of daily learning and cause them to forget material taught during the previous school year. This is why schools started implementing Summer projects to keep students engaged in learning. Summer projects have been traditionally designed by teachers but some people argue that students should be designing these projects. 
as much as gas is, or parts to your normal car are, or even the inside areas, how much will it cost to fix the sensors or even if the driverless car has gas? These things may be a lot harder to pay for since it's all practically technology. 
Finally attending classes at home keeps a student from developing their identities and learning more about themselves 
there are some advantages of limiting car usage 
Most ruls shouldnt just be in texas or california.They should occure in all states.why do only two states get special treatment? 
The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting. 
In all actuality, how many people dont realize how long they spend of their life in a car? If one day all cars in the world were banned, how would everyone recate? Some people may want to give up their cars, some people may not want to give up their cars 
I honestly think cell phones should be aloud in schools during and extra time 
people get to pick who they want by why pick it if you dont pick he most popular vote ,because what if we dont like what you pick ? 
Some children for example need tutoring in certain subjects that you may be able to help with. Another example is cleaning up litter in your local park or just on the streets outside your house. Elderly people can get lonely sometimes and a great way of community service would be to write them letters for the holidays and bring them happiness. If you are interested in arts and crafts you can get together with friends and make artwork for sick children in hospitals. Other people love snow. If you're one of those people who love the snow, you can shovel your neighbors driveways next time it snows. The thing is that if they offer you money, you cannot accept it, you must kindly say no or then it would not be community service. 
I hope Senator, you will take into consideration my statement. 
Not everyone can do homeschooling, 
If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Student's would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job. 
Why do people by more than one car its only one of them and mulitiply cars so why waste money more than one car when you can sell your for things that are important like paying a bill or get gorcery for you house or just helping otherss out so i thing that dumb for peole to have more than one car if you are not going to use the cars all time I understand that celebrites haves mulitiply cars because they show them but the car usage is still high but people can do what evere they want with there money who I am just a boy i coming telling you people with more than car is really really ricdulious to but hey I am going sit back and let people use up there gas in there so be it.      
their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait. 
These are all reasons he supports the idea that it is fun to study, but also dangerous. I will get more in depth with these reasons. 
people aways think computers will always know it all because they dont. 
Since Venus is the second closest planet to the sun the tempetures are really hot, compared to Earth's tempetures. Its so hot the tempetures in Venus are like 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth. 
Most students are very compatible and can be convinced to do something that might not sound fun or appealing at all; but when it comes to adults putting in their share, they normally don't have the time to do so when they have work. 
having interaction with other peers like in the yearbook committee. 
So summer projects should definitely be designed by students to expand their creativity, let teachers grade with time and no stress, and better their learning experience. Not only will students have a great grade on their summer project, but these skills that they are learning and using now will be very useful in college and in the work force when they're older. 
The author expresses his support for the innovation NASA invented. The author thinks that this the object of the future. 
No livingthings lives on this planet if we caan find a solution to this problem we be one of the greatest achievement that human accomplish on earth. 
"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." 
and it would take them years to make. 
It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people. 
I think you should let the students decide whether we should be required or not be required to do community service. 
but there is more negatives on keeping it. 
Community service is important in the world because it helps support ideas like cleaning up our neighborhood to helping the needy. If we didn't have community service, the world may not be a place like it is today. But, everyone has to consider that it is a persons preference to choose to do community service and that they are not forced to do it. Our principal may be doing a good deed in saying that everyone should have to do a certain number of hours of community service, but some people may not be able to and they shouldn't be forced to do any work that they don't have to. 
because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. because thats the only way to get somewhere. 
Elelctors dont matter to most American's. Take the electors and the Electoral College away we dont want something we dont need. All we need is a President, a Vice Presdient, and a Secatary. 
there are manny thing wrong startign with popular votes can lose to electoral votes, also some states can get on people to come and campagne 
Humans need food, water, and air to live, but that doesn't mean that aliens do. They could be like plants and create their own food inside their bodies. As for water, NASA has discovered that there used to be water on the moon, so what is there to believe there couldn't be any water anywhere else.People can be very religious and about the Bible and God, but other people can be all about evolution and not creation. If humans evolved from animals, then we might not be the only ones. Which means that if humans can evolve into humans, then other organisms can evolve, also. 
an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, 
People can listen to others' point of view, which may make it easier for them to decide what decision they're going to make. For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. 
My Claim About The Author Idea That Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's more important because it's the closest planet next to Earth and it gets more attention then the other planets because it's closer to us humans 
They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more 
I would also show them pictures back then of the planet. 
For new voters they may be confused by the eletoral college. New voters may wonder why can't I just vote for the candidate I most prefer. Think about it like this, in the electoral college the electors are the middle man. Why not cut the middle man out? And as a result make the voting system much simpler. 
But then again, a lot of people might not want to do it. 
Although some students lack a healthy domestic environment 
A possible solution is requiring the child stay after school for extra help with teachers, or if that is not possible, encourage small help sessions in class. A child may not be the brightest in school, but may be the best on the basketball team. It is not fair to them to take away something that is amusing for them, or lets them have fun. Their struggling with school isn't going to change if you just take away more privileges. The child needs help. And what i believe may happen is sometimes the child will even start doing worse, or stop focusing as much because he/she is angry and sad they have no privileges other than to focus on their school work more and try harder 
What Is the Electoral College?" states, "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." This is basically saying we can't trust our electors to really vote for what they are assigned. That is like not being able to rely on the school bus to take you to school in the morning, its not a great sense of doubt 
what would happen our fish die because some of us don't pick up after ourselves and the population goes down in poler bears, pelicans, and all sorts of nice loving veracious animals; because we don't make sure our rode' s, rivers, lakes, animals die so i' m saying everyone should pitch in at one time like on weekends or everyday so we don't loose a whole population because of it. 
Firstly, because they have choice in what they do, the students will be able to pick a subject or manner of presentation that they are excited about. If the teacher were to assign the same project to every student without allowing the students to have any say in what they actually end up doing, there would defiantly be students who are not interested in the project. Secondly, the students will also understand the project better. The students will have designed their own project, so they will know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be like and how to get there. Many projects are hard for students because they are not actually aware of what they are intended to do, so by allowing the students to design their own project, the school ensures that the students will completely comprehend it. Lastly, having the project be designed by students means that the students will be given more opportunity for creativity. Because the students more liberty over their project, they will be able to use more of their own unique ideas in the project. 
Humans would not be able to survive on an atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide. It's clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid, and temperatures are averaged over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It would take a very great amount of effort to make Venus a new home. But if it is studied more we may be able to make it a place to stay. 
Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studing Venus, helps us incase we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks.     
During high school, students need this time to learn more than just history or math, they need to learn how to manage their own lives. Giving them the right to design their own project is the best decision for both students and teachers.   
I know some people might want to belive that it was aliens, but it wasn't. Sometimes the earth/nature makes its own natural landforms, and we have to love it for what it created, not give all the credit to some unreal creature. 
We would need to change all the roads and enable electrical cables. 
One thing that connects students and schools all over the nation are the wide range of fun and interesting after school programs, known as extracurriculars. Schools offer lots of extracurricular programs that interest students hobbies and talents from sports, such as football or basketball, to clubs that help out and benefit the school, such as school council or leadership and unique clubs that students share a common interest in such as Harry Potter club or running club. 
If the candidate is attempting to gain more votes by stayong in the same region he or she will not gain more electoral votes. When a person runs for president is they go into many regions to pursuade more people to vote on that person for president then they will gain more electoral votes. 
When people especially your friends know your having problems they'll reach out and ask about how you are and whats going on in your life. 1,000's of people die to suicide every year from not reaching out for help. Knowing that someone is always there is an amazing thing to know. When I have a problem I have 3 friends I always ask and it gets resolved in a short time. 
Using a phone while driving, or being distracted by any piece of technology for that matter, is not acceptable. Lives have been lost, many have been injured, and vehicles have been totaled, all because of a call or text message. Laws must be put in place, and knowledge must be spread to end this practice. When driving, please put your phone down, and instead focus your attention to the task at hand.   
might not be able to achieve there goal. They put in extra work and grinding for along time. Some kids might just be there to say they are on a team or program. If every one had to do one extra activity things would get packed. They have been trying there best for a lot of years and just join something for free. 
Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states "using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face." This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet. 
In my opinion parents and students should get the idea of using techonology 
Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. 
Having students choose their project will save both the teachers and students from the painful force feeding of information. 
NASA scientist dont believe that this was alien trying to send a signal or a message to us for all we know a astroid may hit mars and we didnt know. 
This response will side with the argument of being against driverless cars 
students need more to do then just the simple things. 
When students are more relaxed and comfortable, they are more efficient and productive with their work. They face less pressure from other students and teachers. It makes their work more accurate. In addition, by finishing their work and online classes, they have more time to do what they want and relax. This serves as a motivation for the students to be as productive as possible. Online classes are far less time consuming because you don't have to go anywhere. You can simply wake up, open your device, and start learning; whereas if you're going to school, you have to get ready, travel to school, and sit bored in class wishing to go home. 
According to a studies done by Virginia Techs mental studies, states that 74% of students fall asleep or day dream and stop listening and the other 26% of students listen and learn because they are involed in activities that help refresh there minds and givings them time to thing. What this means is that 74% of student stop listening do to being board or just no intrested but the other 26% is in a club or sport that helps that student refresh their mind and helps them think so they are ready for classes and other work that is needed to be done. 
Everyone has their own opinion though and that's how I see it. 
But some differences are is Earth is ble top have life on it and Venus is not because the heat, pressure, and the chemicals in the air. 
The best way to stop this is through distance learning. Through video chats students will be able to keep up with their learning and work while sick or injured 
Also at the same time i do not believe Joe becuase we have no proof or eveidence that this was really created by alines. 
Extracurricular activities are good for students to participate in because they can give you something to do 
If the voters can not get there votes in to the nominee that they want then how do the votes go to the right elector. For example,the winner take all system,presidential nominees go to the states that they know they have a chance of getting there votes from. A few states never saw a campaign ad such as Rhode island and south Carolina,voters from 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. 
Swing States 
Your friend is driving you home from a party. It was the best time of your life. You feel drowsy, not able to think straight. You notice your friend is texting while driving. You come to your senses and ask if he can pull over, he declines. You black out, what feels like a couple of minutes later you wake up and notice you were in a coma. You ask where your friend is and he's been dead for 2 years. 
That is also a cool fact. I also read in the story that Venus is not the closest to the sun but yet it still is the hotest planet. In passage 4 it states,"The planet (venus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar future". This is a intesting fact 
To ensure we would have less drop-outs, students who have failed for the year, or kids who simply do not understand the material, public schools should take part in making the project a requiremnt that students must complete a summer learning project of their desire, as long as it is something they know little about. The project is expected to be taken serious as an SOL would. It is a great way to make sure that students would not forget any knowledge over their summer. Also, it would be a great excercise for thier brains as well as it would get them ready for college if they plan on furthering their eduction. 
Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true. These so called driveless cars are not driveless car but are cars that can do basic functions of driving but when anything hard pops up, the driver has to drive the driveless car. 
be more social, 
I think the author has some valid details that support his claim, and it's enough to want to take a chance and know about our neighboring planet, Venus. 
When you are on board you can have lots of things to do its not always boring. 
The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. 
Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home 
Source 2 says, "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." 
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. Should these projects be student or teacher choice? Are the students able to create their own? Students summer break is their time ,so why not let them keep it that way? 
Several things you should consider is people can actually vote though popular vote 
he wants to help the people that doesnt have enough food or their house got destroyed 
You should open and share your feeling to the other person so they can understand or they can undeersttand you well. If it's hard to share with friends or teacher you can shared with your parent . They have more year to face with a lot of problem more than you maybe thay will have some good solution that can help you fix the problem 
it would increase student attendance, 
may increase the hopes for more people to vote. 
It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. 
However, electoral college "avoids the problem of elections in which no candiate receives a majority of the votes cast" shown in " In defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the preseident" by Richars A. Posner. This can help the candiates to not be a tied so the Electoral College reduced and thiers a clear winner. 
TO THE FELLOW CITIZENS OUT THERE WE ARE LIMITING CAR'S BECAUES PEOPLE DONT LIKE TO PAY THERE CAR, BECAUES THEY EIGTHER DONT HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT OR THEY JUST DONT WANNA PAY IT.. PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY DONT LIEK AYING THER CADR THATS WHY PEOPLES CAR GET TODE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LAZY..WHEN A CHILD HAS A SOCCER GAME TO GO TO WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU DONT HAVE A CAR TO GET THERE ?OYU PROBABLY DO EVERYTHING YOU CANTO GET THERE TO SUPPORT YOUR CHILD... 
the internet 
The way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate. 
Sure, it may be alright to walk whenever you may feel to 
an electronic code 
so can we actually go in look around in a diffrenet planet in then call it our home well we dont know yet we first need all the information we need to actually start go to a different place but the future well tell the story. 
i hope you rethink about changing the schools policy so that students MAY participate in sports and other activities even if we have a "C" average. 
The job market for cars would collapse and so would the economy leaving thousands unemployed. 
Keeping your mind working during the summer will help you get into the new school year better. This is why most schools require you to complete a summer reading list. Having schools give us projects during the summer will be fun. 
When suming it all up the Electoral College voting system is in a way a bit unfair, but when using the method given each Electoral vote would be given fairly instead of a winner takes all system. When going for just plain voting it would most likely turn out unfair or a lot of tied runnings. When given the facts the Electoral College is fine as it is but can be unfair and that is why we should use this method in the next following elections.     
for the greatness that it would bring to our community 
Venus is often called the Earths sister, or twin. Venus has a realitively similar size to Earth and is actually the closest in distance to Earth. Scientist believe, altought not able to land on Venus, that Venus has a similar surface to Earth as well. Scientist say that Venus has a rocky surface and, as the article says, "... features such as valleys, mountains, and creaters" (paragraph 4). With this, it is also believed that Venus once had oceans. If Venus had oceans, there is a chance that Venus can support life on its surface.Not only is there a posibility that Venus might have had water, the air pressure is very similar to the sea levels on Earth. In Paragraph 5, the article says "... the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth". This means that those who lived on Venus would not be crushed by the weight of the air pressure. On other planet the air pressure is heavy enough to crush a person and is not suitable to live on. 
You don't just have to stay in one area on mars you can go anywhere. Let me start by saying it would be an excellent experience for both kids and adults. 
If a student is being taught you don't have to love the thing you're doing, what matters is you're doing it, are they really being taught the right thing? When they go to get a job that makes a lot of money but they don't really love the job they probably won't be as successful and happy but if students are taught early on that doing what you're passionate about is important, that's a whole lot more important than a random extra curricular activity that they only signed up for because they had to. 
I don't think you should use your cell phone while driving because it is very dangerous to you and other cars. 
I'm a animal lover so that would be amazing . An I love to travel I would love to travel like that . 
he says that it is one of the hottest planets even though its not directly next to the sun the pressure holds the heat in, its hot enough to melt certain metals 
because it makes more sense to just vote for who you think should be president 
someone may have trouble answering your question, 
when you ask people to assist you on a tough choice your going to have to make you will most likely end up making the right choice. 
No one has ever landed on venus so the author is saying this because no space ship has survived landing for more than a few hours. maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on veunus more than three decade, 
I think people should stop drive becuase you really don't need to drive every day 
However, I believe that online classes are very beneficial for students. 
Some may argue that you can make a best friend with the people you go to church with, 
but, that is their oppinion. 
Driving is our main way of transportation so we need to keep ourselves safe and everyone else safe 
all though cells phone distract students from the work in class room and many other reason 
and plus the Electoral College avoids run-off elections so thats a good thing if you want a clear winner 
I am writting this letter on behaf of my feelings on changing the election by popular vote. 
From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face. 
We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that Mars has been changing and the landforms have changed. 
but this may actually determine the election.  
you should join the Seagoing Cowboys 
Driverless cars are also very safe to use. 
He began to say that ailens put it there! 
they should make sidewalk for people that want to walk to school,home,work,or freinds house. 
Its unfair for us voters because of the winner-takes-all system 
Thus aftward scienctists tried to take another picture of Cydonia (The Face) with the improved technology and show that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a landform on Mars.In the image it did look more like a landform 
Well to start off the technology has decoded the Mona Lisa smile 
I believe the Electoral College should not be abolished also, for the reason that each candidate for president has an amount of electors chosen, varying on the state laws in effect in the given state he or she is being elected from. 
School behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. 
As technology continues to advance, students need to be aware of how to work these tools to be prepared for the work force 
But how is this face scan going to work in the first place? Well my guess is the camera so then it can stop theif because if someone tried to login without your permission you can see who it was maybe even contact the police. 
It be awesome to read somebody's emotions thorugh a machine. 
Now that I've read it we don't even vote for the prsident we vote for the slate of electorswho in turn elect the president. Whom are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depnds on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the stateparty's centeral committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. 
Knowledge, it is one of the most powerful things in the world. How do people gain knowledge? They gain information from their mentors, teachers, coaches, parents, and older siblings. People are always learning something new everyday, from how to do long division to how to make friends. The school districts are creating projects for students to do over the summer so they can continue to learn while out of school. 
I think if your good and sports you can participate in sports 
In conclusion venus has many dangers ways and it is very hot planet. its very hard to study  
Summer projects are done by many students and are used by schools to assure learning over the break. Summer projects are usually assigned by teachers or by the school so they know what and how the student is doing academically over the summer. Most of the time, students find the summer projects annoying and a nuissance to their break and, thus, do the project later in the summer rather than doing gadually over summer. 
We need to keep the electoral college because it serves so many purposes in the united states. 
When your teacher assign a project about a topic your going to learn next year, you will already know about it because you did a project on it 
but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong. 
The voting process is just not fair to Americans. 
I would think of this program as a privilege instead of a horrible thing. 
So I have came to give you my opinion on what we should do, and that is, policy 1. To me policy 1 is better 
For example, that person could want a necklace that another wants and they ask and the person says no, that person can feel negative desires for that person. That could lead to stealing the item itself, murdering the person and/or their family members, and/or robbing the store where the person got it from because they cannot afford the item 
A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions. 
I feel that you should change to the popular vote for the President of the United States. 
an abundance of notes for additional help, 
So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself. 
in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. 
But not so much that they could fail all classes and still be able to graduate because they did so much community service.If you are really going to take this seriously I would highly suggest asking the children if they would like to do this. If a lot of people are interested maybe make a sign-up sheet for them. Since so many kids are busy you shouldn't make them doing something likes this unless they are volunteering there spared time. 
the electoral college is a process, not a place. Our founding fathers had established this in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president. as said the electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electorals are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but varys by the state laws on what their responsibility are. Presidental election are held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. we help choose our state electors when we vote for our president. most states have a "winner takes all" system that awards all electors the the winnig candidate. After the election, our state governor prepares a " Certificate of Ascertainment" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your sate with the electors too. so when we vote for our candidiate, then we are really votiong their electors. It should be that we just vote for our candidate and that be just that. the electors do the vote for their candidate, with our votes that we put for our candidate.Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all the one the that they agree on. And its that answer i had in the begining. To be against the electoral college. They want to abolish the electoral college. But they are not alone. In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of  the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. over 60 percent would perfer the direct election. Whats with the electoral college you may ask? Voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I want to know who picks the electors in the first place? It really depends on the state who decides. One other thing about the electoral college is that they are unfair to voters. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. and voters in 25 of the largest media market didn't get to see not even a single campaign ad. So it is official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that is to be by declaring the candidiate who was givien the most popular votes the winner. There is said ti be five reasons for retaining the electoral college. 1. Certainty of Cutcome, 2. Everyone's President, 3. Swing States, 4. Big States, 5. Avoid Run-Off Elections. its an arguement that the electoral college method of selecting the president may be turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in california. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
has most of the common emotions so the FACS has a very good chance of being accurate and valuable. 
''The electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.' 
Use the technology to read student emotion that you can know the student if you don't understand the student or you are new teacher here. Some of student now they have a lot of trouble or sad story they try to hind . They try to be happy in froent of evryone. But at nigh or when they come back home hey will feel sad they cried all day all night. They will be a not social or can't focus on study so if we use that technology it will let the teacher know the feeling of each student. If they have any problem the teacher can help them figure out or help them overcome that feelunng and bring student the possituve feeling. 
However, teacher-designed projects are helpful too, they teach exactly what the teacher would teach them in class which gives learners an understanding of the content from the teachers perspective and could possibly give them knowledge on material they do not know. 
What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness. 
whether it be with the thoughts of their Buzz Lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone. When children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system, these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile, solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task. If a child were to attempt to learn at home, no matter what age they were, they would be surrounded with the temptations of play, and, even if they had the power to restrain, it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information. 
I believe we should keep the Electoral College 
Even other Americans believe that the election should be based off of majority vote. Sixty percent of them believe that to be true! The electoral college is a waste of time. 
abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us. 
The dreaded summer assignment, boring students by holding them hostage inside and not letting them enjoy their time to be free. All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. 
Have you ever thought of being a Seagoing Cowboy. 
Systems like this have the chance to not be right. Make believe what this system is all about. 
In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winner-takes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral  college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once.    
The first reason this is unfair is becasue of the "winner-take-all system". 
But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended. 
This show how the author that studying venus is a worthy.Another reason why the author suggest that studying venus would be a worthy pusuit despite the danger is that Venus was probably covered with oceans and it could be our nerest option for a planetary visit. According to the text " The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes famliar feature sych as valleys,mountains,and creaters. Furthermore, recall the Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crusial consideration given the long time frames of space travel". This supports what the author suggets. 
It can be good for them because they might enjoy it 
But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. 
The concept of using cell phones/mobile devices while driving is one that needs to get rid of immediately. There are countless outcomes that result from cell phone usage while driving and all of them are negative ones which shows that it should be banned. The health risks are severe as well as the vehicular risks and the government has had to step in because of the realization that using cell phones while driving is a lose-lose situation no matter what.   
due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it. 
I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. 
basically we need to keep the electoral voting for some practical reasons thta we do not know about now maybe it could be from thedispute over recent years of voting .or we can choose a different option then electoral voting maybe instead of the canindates to get voted by a party we should just vote on a popular vote that we should rely on next time it comes around    
even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings 
It makes sence why some poeple think different. I mean everybody has they own point of view on thuings. They wil stick to it to, they will consider them selves right still after you prove them wrong. People will always have there own perspective on things no matter what. so that means that mostly everybody will have some one that disagrees with them one way or another. Since this has opened up to the world in manny different ways, it makes it a whole lot easier to make up assumptions and nad there own way of thinking when it comes to this very starge but normal situation. Poeple have even seen thingslike this on the moon and that didnt phaze a single person. Its just people these days and how they think. they will just pull your leg. 
So giving them the right to have their phone out during free time will help a lot of people stay out of trouble. This would be a good policy to make because almost everyday people get their phone taken away for pulling it out during class. 
A thick layer of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. 
have fun, 
The electoral college system sholud be kept if it help  the people 
Just give us a chance 
The electoral college gives America certainty of an outcome, without a tie, or a run-off election 
Like, global warming or green house gases. less trees would be cut down for parking lots or paved streets. 
Now for someone who never does their school work does not have a job and just sits around on their lazy butts all day long those are the people that should be doing community service 
Another good reason to use them is because instead of kids talking during class, they would much rather texting or calling there friends that's not nearby. 
Venus, as the author talks about, was a worthy pursuit becuase they had found very good and ineresting findings 
It's better to keep studying Venus then to just go visit it, because there would probably be stuff on Venus that the scientist don't even know about and then the people that would go visit Venus would be in such danger. 
Not only will this rule be beneficial to all of the students physical and mental health, 
Extracurricular activities are a good way to socialize with people because you are participating in activities and games that you enjoy with other people. 
Voters cannot always control who they are voting for but that is ok. the state decides who to pick the elctors thats in first place. Its ok to make mistakes sometimeas. HEY were all human ,no matter what were will never change 
When you take away a students exercise you could make them have a risk of death. 
Students would probably skip school because of this machine. Lots of schools will be empty because students do not want teachers to know about them. This machine could be used in pictures or face portates to see how the person in the picture is feeling, but to use it on students then no. 
"Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on car-free day". This day in Bogota has been celebrated for three years straight now, "where cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of seven million". The goal of this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Even when it rains on car free day in Bogota this doesn't stop people from participating," says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. A businessman says "it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." 
We should not have leave up to the electors to make the final vote. 
The reason i choose this as a beneficial reasoning is because many kids need respect now days. 
I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. 
The canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, 
In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. "After the presidential election, your governor prepares a "Cerificate of Ascertainment" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors."  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. 
Venus is the closet plant to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance as well. As well as Venus being close to Earth, there's also mars which these two are our planetary neighbors, whom orbit the the sun at different speeds. Since we have Venus being around the corner at times, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-drapped world not knowing anything about this planet. We have sent numerous people to explore this planet not knowing the dangers it presents, all though its worth knowing. 
I think that kids should be required to do community service and I also think that it depends on what the parents say 
People would act different one the road knowing who is responsible. 
The oposition states that the electoral collage is a nessesity for organization. 
According to the article venus is dangerous, But scientist dont care. they are fascinated by Venus because it may once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Scientist has been sending spacecrafts on Venus but no spacecraft has survived the landing 
In conclusion, attending and completing online courses at home would be beneficial to students because the course may be learned individually without the social stress of public school, the students won't fall behind if they are sick, and many teachers advise attending courses online due to their students abilities to perform stronger in the course and its better online structure. 
Using those to associated every characteristic of the facial muscles and using them on Mona Lisa. With new software it can recongize Mona Lisa emotions. Which can actually calculate emotions of others. 
In a case of emergency you need as much communication ways as possible. So think about it and think about the future needs and chose carefully. 
Students should start helping others with things they would need help with. Students should start helping others whenever they think someone needs help 
But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary Vee, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university. 
Second Venus is called the earth twins. why do you ask? Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. 
have you ever wondered how nice community service is? 
The first reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it provides balance in students' schedules 
if summer projects are student-designed, then students won't be as stressed about the project as they would if it were the teacher's project. 
This states it unually is common around Mars. People think it is just a landform. In the article it says it is hard to find the face. Everyone seemed excited they found the face on Mars! 
So now we all know how the Electoral College is unfair. Because of the constant votes that don't matter at all yet they always make sure to vote that president and all of the popular votes wouldn't matter. That's why I want to change to popular votes than the Electoral College does. All we need to do is work together to over come the Electoral College so the votes can be fair and we would want to vote for the president that we want.    
They thought that it was a Martin mesa but it was common for that to happen around Cydonia. 
For many people politics is a very serious topic that people strongly believe in. recently, there has been alot of contraversy about keeping the Electoral College process or changing the election by popular vote, 
In this sitiuation We're trying to convience people and tell them that aliens has nothing to do with this. 
Going to school everyday can be difficult for certain students. Many kids and adults have work, sports, or medical problems that can get in the way of their learning life. This can affect the students education gravely and it can even prevent them from moving forward in their education. Although, people prefer their children to go to school where there are teachers and people who can help them, actually, it is better to have the option to learn through an online class 
Case and point, the Electoral College is a flawed system. People are educated and can make a smart choice for a president, everyone deserves fair say in the political world, and people need to open their eyes to the corruption that the Electoral College allows for. It may have made sense back in the day of the founding fathers, but it is time to move on and adopt the popular vote system that the people have asked for.    
Then they show us how we can do it at home and how we can make use smile or happy. 
In the first article, it says "MOST states have the "winner-takes-all" system", 
Another reason cell phone use while driving should be banned; if adults use their phone while operating a vehicle their children will possibly be strongly influenced by it. 
it makes students do something they don't like 
higher grades 
What if your principal said that everyone would have to stay after school for and extra hour only to participate in a useless activity? How would you feel if someone where to interfere with your schedule? The school says that we must participate in an extracurricular activity. You might be wondering why the school would want us to participate in a club. The whole reason is because they think that it would shape our future, give us a learning experience, and make us want to learn something new. Although this is true, there are more downsides to this rule than you think 
not everyone is perfect in school, and not everyone gets all A' s and B' s. 
In columbia they are allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college 
but whats best for us might not be want we want, it might not be what we think is best for us why does are vote no longer count? 
Some may argue that student-designed projects allow students to have creativity, individuality, and freedom. As a result of these things, students would be more inclined to complete the project; 
The face on Mars is just a natural landform 
Everyone has that one good argument. Everyone calls the Electoral College a disaster factor. 
Beacuse kids might not fall asleep in class as much if thcomputer sees it and will fix it and it will help whats wrong with people 
All community service is voluntary work, if its not voluntary, then it is just work 
However the scientist doesn't think that. 
there are less cases of missing class from emergencies 
the congress has some erros 
Most classes follow a curriculum schedule that the teacher need to follow. Without the teacher giving the project the student might not learn the things required or not learn enough for the curriculum. When I had an online class my online teacher was very good. She provided me with enough guidelines that I was able to learn the material needed for me to pass the class. Having the teacher design the project will make sure that the student learns the material required for the curriculum. 
The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal 
Just the other day i was with a friend and his grandmother, and we were in the car driving down the road and the next thing i know , someone's car breaks down in the middle of the street and we help them! It was a woman and her son and she just picked up her son from school , and we had to push their car back to a store and we took them home !yes it was tough to push a car but as soon as we started pushing all together we finally got it to start moving and after we started to get it to move more people came and helped after everyone started to help ,it was like a piece of cake After that day i was excited to help someone out their that needed help ! 
take for instance the George Bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. Im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best. 
Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While "recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. 
It is like eath twin 
"SLAM!" Generic_Name throws the door back behind her. Generic_Name's mother flies down the stairs so fast, she nearly face plants into the wall ahead. "What's the matter honey?" "Ughh! My new principal just announced that all students are now required to participate in an extracurricular activity everyday after school, and i don't have any interest in that!" Generic_Name shrieks."Well why is that such a bad thing?" her mom says calmly."That's the point! i don't want to waste my time after school on something stupid like that. I would rather be relaxing by myself after all of my homework," Generic_Name answers irritably. "Come on, you could make new friends, and might surprise yourself with new interests."I think it would be really good for you," her mom explains. "Well I disagree," Generic_Name responds. "Please would you give it a try? I see opportunity for you here. I really do," Her mom pushes. "I don't need more people or friends in my life. Besides, none of the activities offered sound appealing to me at all," Generic_Name says. " How about cross country? You know your dad and i used to do it when we were younger, and when you were little you always talked about how you wanted to be a runner like me when you got older. Just try it, and if you really don't like it, i'll go talk to your principal about the requirement," her mom offers. "I don't know," Generic_Name contemplates. "Think about all of the great opportunities and things that could come out of this!" Generic_Name's mom says positively. "Please?" her mom tries one last time. Generic_Name sighs. "I guess," she finally agrees. 
70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and  57 percent sold a car to move to Vauban germany. giving up your vehicle isnt pleasent and expeacially if your streets are completly "car free". Vauban has ownly two places to park :-large garages or if a car-owner buys a space along with a home. Not everyone thinks the same about cars in Vauban/germany. A mother of two walked down the street and didnt worry about no cars coming her way or her two childrens"im much happier this way". 
Everyone asks for help sometimes, but have you ever thought of asking more then one persons advice? 
The president is to make smart decent relevant choices. And if he listen to the voices of Americans than he would have lots of ideas lots! 
I understand doing community service is a good thing to do in this world , but kids shouldn't do it at all ! 
With the face on mars no one belived that it was actually a face they thought that it was and ancient monument on mars and when NASA first saw the face on mars they thought that it was the landging place of the viking 1's sister ship the viking 2. Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon. So the face on mars was alo just a huge rock formation and the eyes nose and mouth was just an illussion formed from a shadow. Also about the alien articact their was not one they thought that their was a hidden alien artifact and hidden alien marking hidden by the haze. 
People asking for advice almost all the time when they have a problem to deal with. They can get answers from various amount of people, no matter who it is. Seeking advice from multiple opinions can help people make better choices because they can view different viewpoints from others, have a different understanding of the problem, and can find multiple ways to solve the problem. No matter in any situation, people can always find advice that can always lead them to find a solution. 
At this time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a picture of the Face that was very sharp and you could tell what it was. 
All we want is a change, it deosn't have to rewrite the Constitision. But the Electoral College must go. 
But I dont blieve this computer can tell people feelings. 
I know that some teenagers will still try to text during class but the number of people who do will go down 
School is indeed an essential part in the development of one's mind and future. However, it's not the perfect solution for everybody, as some people produce a higher performance rate when it comes to learning at home through digital methods. A common reason would be the people who aren't as socially adept in comparison to the others, and encounter some difficulties learning in such a public area filled with a large amount of people. They would usually work better in a more secluded workplace such as their home. I can personally attest to this myself, as I've occasionally resorted to partaking in online conferences, as on occasions, I would have difficulty learning in an area with people I lacked the determination to interact with. This doesn't just only include social aspects though, as even people with poor health, like the common cold or even more detrimental illnesses, will find it very beneficial to learn through virtual means 
Continuing on, school online helps get work done faster without having to travel from classroom to classroom in a class for only an hour and a half or less. 
but, was less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example the 2012 election, with Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to Romney vote 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast. 
This article is very good. I like this but of coarse there are some down falls to everything. I like how they did this software on "Making Mona Lisa Smile" becuase this picture inspired other people. But the computer expressions isn't a good idea. They aren't doing this for a good cause. When people have a chance to skip an ad or an advertisment they will. 
Many people in political carrers question why not many people vote in the United States Of America. 
This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future. 
Conspiracy theorists say that the people of NASA are hiding the evidence of life on Mars. 
Elecotral College is important, you can say that because maybe you agree to it but i still don't 
I understand the need for the Electoral College, when it comes to some decisions. Like avoiding a national catastrophe when it comes to the nuber of swing-votes. 
Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars

The classroom provides a social setting for students to work with each other, ask each other questions, and create connections that one otherwise could not at home. Class with friends makes education just a little more enjoyable. It is the slightest incentive for students to come to school with a smile on their face. I absolutely despise the subject of Calculus, but it is a class a have with some good friends and a teacher that I trust and respect. One morning I strolled into the classroom without a care in the world, until I was greeted with a test on derivatives that completely slipped my mind and I did not study for. One of my friends was in the same boat, which provided some sort of comfort. Our other friend quickly tutored us as we panicked to prepare for the test. We bounced questions off each other in quick, effective communication and suddenly I felt comfortable and prepared. I took my time, thought critically and made my way through each problem. I remembered my friends familiar voice and it guided me to completion. She was the reason I had passed the test. Communication with peers I have bonded with helped me to understand a topic effectively and efficiently. This is a huge benefit to education that is impossible to take advantage of through a screen. 
Drivers constantly get destructed by text messages, games alert, social media updates, and other. Textingand driving or driving and getting distracted by their phones are the most common thing that killed people and having car accident. Most of these things that are happening are caused by teens. Teenagers are the number one reason texting and driving are happening and going on.         
develops creativity. 
Some people are very serious about their choice of the president they take their time to learn what the president could do for them and their state and country. So when that much time is put in to making that vote people would get mad if a person with an entirely different idea just takes their vote and places it wherever they want. 
My last reason is that us the people of the United States of America do not want no scum bag of a president that does nothing what so ever to our country 
What if you the reader are using this and it tells you that you are mad then keep it. Then on the other hand you got to realize that if it says that you are mad but you are happy, then give it back to the company that you bought the item from and get your money back. So that is why my claim is going to be against what the author is trying to say. 
the most basic arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguments agianst direct elections are spurious at best. its hard to say this but bob dole was right :abolish the electoral college! 
All students schools should be able to have the chance to express themselves in any way possible. If schools make this decision all staff will get to see a hue change in the students. It is just an overall great and smart decision that schools need to make. From me agreeing with this suggestion I hope new things come our way in our everyday school life!        
The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents in the article "The Challenge Of Exploring Venus" 
nevertheless the electoral colleges dispute over its outcome is possible, it also nrequires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, its winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes does induce the candidates, the electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed on the constition, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. 
You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count 
it allows caters to their classroom experience, 
I support my answer and said what I thought was a right/ good enough answer for all the team and people to understand. 
I would rather them keep it the same because its simple 
One thing i do not get is why high school has to have boo bags with them .They should have the phones in the book bags . They should just leave the phones in there locker or book bag .I am going to high school next year so maybe they school make a new rule about phones. 
Lets say you need to choice what career you wanted to do and you wanted to be either a nurse or a doctor. One person may say you should be a doctor because you will earn more money but another may say the opposite. They may say to become a nurse because later if you wanted to become a doctor you could go back to school and become a doctor. With those opinion it makes you think about the importance of what your going to do. 
Dear principal i think that you should be able to bring your cell phones to school 
In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms. 
The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. 
This way students don't have any stress over getting class on time or missing any classes. Also students it is more relaxing because it is just yourself and the computer. So this way you don't have to worry about other kids or anything that would distract you. In a regular classroom at school there is some kids that distract the entire class and you just feel so hopeless because you are trying to learn but you are too distracted by the other kids. This way you can focus more and learn better. 
I mean think about about it, why would we hide evidence that would benefit this whole organization? Most of the people here at NASA wish that there was an early civilization on Mars. If we did find life on Mars we would share it world wide, it would be one of the greates scientic breakthroughs in history. 
"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. 
Everyone makes millions of choices in his or her lifetime. While making these choices, it is not uncommon for one to ask others for advice. Often, one will consult multiple people. 
Once, i had no idea if i should take an instrumental class or an art class. I gathered different opinions in order to make a decision which helped me a lot! 
People just dont care anymore about how or where they live and they will just throw any kind of trash they want on the ground. So driving cars just helps the people already littering, the cars are just polluting the air we breathe. So instead of us Americans not giving a crap about what were doing to the wonderful beautiful planet we live on, we should start, and help, but not driving the things that pollute are air. 
because they many pros and con. pros student can work on thier own 
Some belive that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for whta they do. Presidents talk about what they are gonna do to help the country and the slate elelctors define what the presidents are gonna do to help out that certain state. Then the people of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should stay around alot longer the system is just rigt for voting. 
I think that having communityes without cars is great for the inviroment and if people want to do that then good for them. but i dont think i could survive with out a car 
the electoral college method of selecting the president is and will turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. 
The author explains how he thinks that it is a worthy cause to try to explore venus, even though we have never successfuly landed a spacecraft there for more than a few hours. 
Having multiple opinions is important, but also just having someone to talk to can be just as important for having advice.The next reason is having someone to talk to, this can help you for multiple reasons like getting better advice and being happy 
One of the reasons why i would go with policy 1 is that there could be an emergency somewhere in the school and nobody knows about it and you have a cell phone with you, you could call the office or a teacher. 
What i mean to the closes is Venus could possible be another earth because it has the same features and it may well once have been the most earth - like plantet in our solar system, and in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too.Earth is closes to venus and mars but orbit the sun at different speeds means sometimes we are closer to mar and sometime venus. 
Just like Source 2, I feel "The Electroal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. " "Abolish the electroal college!". 
I wanted to adress the positivity in keeping the Electoral College. 
Some may say that's its a waste of time and they could be out having fun with there friends or going to parties and what not. 
Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. 
Its a policy for some people to do community Service if they get kick out of school, 
In consideration to my previous statement, if we make the activities seem more like a hobby instead of a chore then students will be more willing to join in. Then, maybe, this will cause a domino effect where one student will tell their friends how exciting community service is and this will lead more children to participate. For Ex: When a group of students are going to clean the litter in their neighborhood, they could make this into a sport. Where the kids grab the trash, like bottles or paper, and they throw it into the garbage bag or recycling bin as if they were playing basketball. 
the heat/friction sensor pannels will produce enough electrical energy to power builds, appartment complexs, houses, or even recharge a battery with in seconds.the way we live now we can do all those things its just people dont know how to use there brain and come up a cleaner source of renewable energy. this entire project could be free and go world wide as long as everyone in the world can a agree this is perfect replacement to fossil fuels. if this document could get the th government somehow ican change the world for the better and probably save our poluted earth from destroying its self. i could fix the green house eeftect on the earth and you could clean up radio active polution by not useing gas powered cars. our erath could go back to a clean slat where there is no polution made by toxic fumes in the atmosphere and destroyed rivers and lakes. everything could be fixed by one simple thought of a childs mind. if only adults knew how to listen to there own words that they teach us with how to listen twice as muchas they speak. ifthis country has the right to freedom of speech then i think my idea isworth telling the world about. and not keeping my mouth shut. i should be speaking on air to the world not in my house being yeld at by my parents becuase what i want to nobody wants to hear. if anyone gets to read this please immediatly take to someone important that would love to here my idea. thank you.    
Although one might not get the response they want 
Electoral college is a process which is irrational, unfair and outdated.                      
This is the thing that can not be changed because this is a system that we can pull up see what they were elected for and why they were voted president and how many times. It helps us how we can choose the right president or the right vice president. 
When athletes get injured they get an opinion from the doctor if they think they should get surgery or whatever and most of them go to other doctors for more opinions to find there best option. This helps them a lot because some doctors could say they need surgery but then others they go to could say that they won't need surgery and that they just need rest or physical therapy or something. sometimes the doctors will even say they might need career ending surgery but another doctor says that he can still play after a surgery he just need to recover. As you can expect that other opinion helps big time for them so they won't have to possibly end there career. Or it could be the other way around that one doctor says he dose not need surgery but other doctors do then he should go with surgery so whatever is hurting does not get worse and force him to stop playing. For example a couple of weeks ago there was this pitcher in baseball that got injured and was going to doctors to see if he was okay one doctor said he would need Tommy John surgery which usually puts you out for a whole season and he didn't want that so he went to two other doctors who both said he wouldn't need it so that saved him from missing a entire season which helps him a lot. 
Some say its best to have a bias voter choose because they wont choose someone based on what everyone else's opinion is, like how the south favored romney over obama 
Computers can tell how someone is feeling according to the article ''some new computers software that can recognize emotions''. 
makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do 
Whe we get to choose our presedent then we will respect him. When you respect someone then you follow what tthey have to say and dont give them crap for it. when someone you dont like is presedent why should you repect them? we sll know you wouldnt and that you would go aginst almost everything they say even if they actully do say somerting you agree about your still not going to respect them be cause tou dont like them. 
So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me. 
students should be the ones creating the summer projects 
While this could be true, it can be easily fixed by talking with the teachers and creating a learning strategy that benefits everyone. 
The Electoral College has a very wide range. it spreads all through USA and each state has a different number of electoral Votes. Each party selects a bunch of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee. 
The idea of these "Driveless Cars" does sound intersting and at the most fascinating. But however i'm going to say i'm all that for that particular idea for a few reasons 
with majority votes in a state is the state vote, such as if 46 percent of people in a state voted one candidate and 54 for the other insted of just giving the candidates their votes the majority decided one would have them. 
The Face on Mars is actually not a face but a natural landform 
If something gets tied then they just throw the vote to the house of represenitives. I think if there is a tie that it should result in a re-election. 
But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.                                      
With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president 
I think that its a good idae to send more probes to venus even despite the cost. i am totally on bourd with this. 
it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. 
Some may argue that using a cellular device should be allowed on the pretense that the driver is using the device as a GPS. 
Let's say Generic_Name was still unsure about what to do about her toxic friend, she could ask her old friend Generic_Name, who stopped talking to Generic_Name a while ago, what to do. Generic_Name knew that Generic_Name used to playfully make fun of Generic_Name but then one day Generic_Name just left the group. Generic_Name could tell Generic_Name that she went through the same thing and she just couldn't take it anymore and she had to leave that situation. This information could help Generic_Name make a choice because she now knows that Generic_Name has treated her friends like this in the past and that she is not just being sensitive 
I can see why people say that community service isn't necessary. 
It's in the constitution that we have a right to vote and that we have the right to choose our president, but you people in the electoral college take away that right when we only get to vote for a slate of people. If elections were done by popular vote things might have been different in many ways. First off, in the 2000 election if it was done by popular vote, Bush would not have won and we would have had, Al Gore as president. 
can improve life skills. 
In paragraph four the passage states,"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This piece of text from paragraph four shows that Venus is the planet most like Earth and had the ability to support life because it use to be covered in oceans. 
I thank we all should have B orC average cuz we all should 
Also there are reading clubs i you love reading this is the right club for you 
In conclution you need to change the system for the people and overall just make voting a lot easier.    
in conclusion I think it is very useful in my opinon and I hope they make more of these inventions 
. But you know what principal at the same time you have a point because if we really care about our grades and about playing sports i think that's a okay thing to do because it would really help some people and we will be improving a lot well them after sports are over some people might have really grades. 
there is also plenty of time for sightseeing and other things once you arrive at your destination. 
Expecially now that we have so many of our constetutional rights going out of play and being laid to rest for the many  years that they helped serve us justice and made us actually realize our country went to war to fight for our freedom, thats basically taking away our freedom to have who we think is best in office. Everybody talks about both candidates. 
I believe that rather than having theElectoral College , we should have elections by popular vote 
On this times people are been racist with people who are poor and having a different color skin, but if they get to know everyone, they are going to take a good example of life from the others , that try go get from all the problems they have and making them thinks that they keep following their dreams without taking care of those problems. 
Theres also rumors of the Electoral College like people calling it the disaster factor because people say it cause to much drama and is risky. 
Because of the air pollution 
when some people go to vote the are confused on the electores and vote the wrong candidate. the electors dont alawys vote for who we want sometimes they put that voite aside and vote for whom ever they wish. in all realaity we dont need them all they do is cause a mess in the prosses. 
Nasa is doing this so They don't have to got on Venus in person instead they are using a robot to gather information baout Venus. 
Stated in paragraph three, NASA uveiled the image for all to see, it was a huge rock formation, which resmebled an humans head making out the shaped of nose, eyes, and mouth. 
if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then. But for now they're just for fun and now days teenagers just want to hangout with friends and be on their phone. 
and finally if the school has to cancel due to weather or illness related issues, 
The caption on the photo when they posted it on the internet was "Huge rock formation...Which resembles a human head... formed by sadow giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." 
Imagen this say a presidents term is up and your congress wouldnt you want a say in who you might work with or would you just have to keep up with two candites that you dontknow. 
a knowledge of how students work based off of experience. 
It is hard to study Venus 
Overall the face is decaying over the years if there was aliens then don't you think they would fix it at least maybe once or twice over the many years that "their creation" that proves that ali nes didnt make it. 
Students should help around their school by picking stuff up in the halls when they see it or taking things that people have found to the lost and found. 
If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive. 
some people se the limiting of car usage as less tense 
Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students. If the students take classes in school, there will be more teachers and staff at the school. Truly, learning from a teacher helps you a lot, because they are teaching you face to face. 
for example .the online classes are a easy way to learning at home. 
People shouldn't think that doing community service wastes your time 
When I was frist asked I know that I couldn't say no. I belive that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I got to see Europe and China. To me seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Also in Venice, Itily. The streets were water! 
The also supports his idea of studying Venus depsite the dangers because he includes past experiences that make this idea stronger. 
during football games the players can be really loud and anoying and tease you wich can be bad and get people mad that has happened alot during football history. 
Additionally, distance learning does not allow for the same hands-on experiences as physical schooling does. 
Well for starters, under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This was stated by Bradford plumer in his article : The indefensible Electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong 
In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.  You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.  It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles.  If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to "give up" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.  In Vauban,Germany, this "smart planning" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.  "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer.  70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.  The town is not completely "car free," there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg.  Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.Smog is a big problem in Paris,France.  After several days of "near-record pollution," Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air.  About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.  The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.  The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France.  The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.           
The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars 
Your letting them have some freedom when it comes to communication, but at the same time you have control over them. 
The argument can be made that attending classes from home does not allow students to develop communication and social skills because of the decrease in social interaction. 
Under the Electoral college, voters dont vote for the president, they vote for state electors who in turn elect the president. 
In my opinion, Im against of the value of using technology to read students emotional expresses. 
source 1: what is the electoral collage?by the office of the federal registerThe electoral college is a proccess,not a place. The founding established it in the U.S. constitution as a compromise between election of the president and the congress and the election of the president by a polpular vote of qualified citizens.(paragraph, 1 sentance, 1).The electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electors votes are required and is reqiured to elect the president(paragraph 3 sentance 1) 
Although, taking class in school isn't that much bad but student can't concentrate at class. 
Schoolwork is difficult to each student for different reasons; moreover, no student is the same and should not have to work at a level that is too difficult for them 
everything is label right, 
helping the community would be a great achievement for everyone. 
I however, believe every student should give some effort to help out. 
Different perspectives help others understand your problem so they can help you, and also you can now rearrange the pieces of your situation to find a solution. It's always better to look at your choices in a new perspective, because you might find it easier to choose the best one for you from that angle. When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision. 
The people in American should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the largest election crisis in a century; the system could have lead to much worse than that. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors, adn that those electors could alwyas defy the will of the people 
Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are:- Spend more time in the computer- More focus in the homework- Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want- Study all the day- No talk with your friends during your class- Finish more fast with no distraction 
If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win. 
As you speak with more people, you'll hear more of their experience 
Although Venus is a very harsh planet and there may not be any possibility of life, it would still be worth it to explore this planet and how it works. The author explains in detail what Venus is like and supports his ideas with scientific facts and data. There is a possibility that life could sustain on Venus but that is unknown unless the option is explored.     
I've traveled to China and Europe. I saw the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy where the streets were water, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China. We actually do have time to see places on our way to places. 
This new sytem is a great idea/invention. this needs to be known. mor people need to know about this amazing idea. 
im not the only one that wanted to gte rid of the Electoral College. 
Do you think it was made by an alien or is it a natural landform? Many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but others say that is a natural thing. 
they know that other states will have no affect to them when getting no vote. Im guessing that they get their hopes up? They dont give other people a chance to vote. 
I think the facial acting coding system will be a good idea on life on this plane. t it could help out our students 
This picture was 10 times as better as the original and shows a natural land form. 
it would change our inverment becaus ealot of people can just go to a computer and if the happy or sad it would say 
venus is a hard planet to study but it is very worth it. Becayse there are alot of things you can descover about venus and alot of people that would love to know whats really on venus.        
The author talks about different stuff how our sister plant is so inhospitable". Scientists also see and search what's going on in the world and in the planets. I think it's good that we know some of these stuff so we know in the future that can happen. 
The reason why we should not abolish The Electoral College is that every state counts as a vote. One example is that Florida has 29 electoral votes, but big states with less people has a lowerer electoral vote. 
I think kids should not have to do community service 
Once they decide that they don't want to sacrifice themselves for others, it is going to be hard to change their minds. 
until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho. 
and they will also be able to see what kind of job fits them. 
"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." 
Well In this part I think is good and bad idea. 
This letter is concerning your considerations of implementing the policy of requiring school sports players to maintain a B average (3.0 GPA) in order to play their respective sport. 
In my personal oppinion I think it's best to keep the Electoral College. 
Students need to be able to learn on their own and to communicate with teachers on how well they´re understanding what they´re learning. By using facial recognition technology, its taking away their communication skills. There are many flaws to the facial-expression technology that make it a bad candidate to use in schools. It´s certain that there are plenty of good uses for facial expression technology, however using it in schools is not one of them. 
you could meet new people on the ship and get to know them 
There are many reason why Electrol College should not be kept, but it is the right thing if we change it to election by popular vote. This Reason why I pick this is because us people want the right leader to leads us on a good path thats why we are citizens our job is to vote for them. 
i also think students should really take a thoughtful moment about rather the community service activity should or would waste their quality time at home just wasting a lot of time ands not really learning about anything important. 
The electorial college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes by the cast. 
In life we always struggle to learn new things about ourselves and broaden who we are. Through challenges students face in school and the friends they make better help them understand who they are and develop their identities. Interactions in schools, different friend groups, and learning about the world in classes with others help students shape their identities. Students learn new perspectives from others and get to choose whether to agree or disagree but with online classes we don't have all these opportunities that help students develop their identities and broaden who they are. 
Extracurricular activities can help improve students' social skills 
This is also a win , win situation because the high school/ middle school student would be able to get their minds refreshed with what the learned a couple years back and the other win would be the student from elementary would be getting help and will make progress with their academics . I know that parents will be coming to you saying "wow , SCHOOL_NAME has an amazing principal and teachers cause they know how to really help my son/daughter " and wouldn't that be nice ? thought so . 
but will they have enough time to completely survey the area and assess the situation? Or will the car be able to warn them in time? The answer is most likely to be answered, but is still a dangerous situation for a new driver. 
Do you think it is a good idea to succeed? I believe it is good to succeed in life, that is why seeking opinions from multiple people helps you succeed. 
When i joined the program it was hard definaty it a job after all my main purpose was to go of to the seas to another country and help poeple in needs. 
By providing students the chance to participate in extracurricular activities, you are letting them get a head-start in life. By trying out different activities, they will be able to determine which one they like the most and want to pursue as a career. Many students in high school still don't know what career path they want to pursue, but students who had to do an extracurricular will already know which one they prefer to others. Thus, they won't be puzzled by the time they have to choose a career. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities will help strengthen their resume when they need it. A student who has done multiple extracurricular activities will be preferred to another student who has not done any. Furthermore, my sister, Generic_Name, never knew what career she wanted to pursue until she took a building class as an extracurricular in 9th grade. She instantly fell in love with it and could use that extracurricular class as a bonus on her resume. She is now in her first year at Yale, studying engineering. This shows why extracurricular activities will help students discover their passion. 
Because we have eight hour in school and I think it is right if you let us use it when free time is giving to us, but not during class time. I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can. 
Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment. 
able to do some sightseeing in other countries 
A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in the united states. Bogota, Colombia even becan a "car-free day" in wich all cars, besides busses and taxis, are banned in this capital city of 7 million for an entire day. Violaters of this ban are fined $25. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Plaza. This event is even starting to spread. For the first time two other Colombian cities have joined the event. Using cars is becoming less and less common, and it's a trend the enviornment can enjoy. 
However, this can be difficult when there are constant distractions in the classroom 
In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power. 
You and I know that kids will still try to text during class, 
The electoral  college is in good shape for staying and not changing a disater only happend once 14 years ago back in 2000 
at home student may cheat not body knows, whether he complited task or not. No one have to care. That the bid different you may see. Because is said the meaangless of student who work by himself he will never feel couragoues like other it is hard. Even to trust what he is doing sometimes nor always. 
The opportunity for students to attend online classes or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who suffer any sort of mental or physical illness. 
u may wonder how the electors work because all u do is see them behind the prsident well the process is hard and they want students who wants to be an elector to get ready on what they are about to get in to . it first start off by the u choosing the president when u choose the president u choose the group of electors this means when you choose the president the electors goes with him or her , most states have winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winng pesidental canidate's electors . after the election the govoner pepares a 'certificae of ascertainment'. this means that that it is listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with names of their respective electors . the electors go through a long process . and the college wants the studentsa to know all the things they need to before they become electors. 
First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance. So if trying to seek to a conduct would have to resolve in getting close and personal despite any risks to do it. 
Our school principal doesn't let us bring our cell phones to school and some kids do understand and other act like if they misunderstood 
However, some people argue that students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities in school. They cite people such as Jessica Grant, a professor from the West Virginia University of Psychological Studies, who said, "when people have a choice in what they do, they tend to feel the benefits much more than those who are forced to do something." 
In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called "face" is not made by aliens.The prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.My job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.The figure that NASA saw was a so called "face on mars".They claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens. 
A comfortable atmosphere for a person seeking to expand their knowledge will be most beneficial because it allows someone who has difficulty in social setting to not feel as if they are being punished for wanting to continue on with schooling. 
Examples from the passage are, the cars will probably have a hard time navigating through work zones and around accidents. The cars will also have to deal with complicated traffic issues , such as navigating through roadworks or roadblocks that lie ahead for the autonomous car. 
These people can actually use it for there iphones now. For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device.The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology. I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea. 
Some people may disagree on that. Maybe other people want just states to vote, and get it over with. It would be an easier way to choose the president, 
There are reasoning behind this idea of online education that could help students in different kind of ways 
therefore, it would be best if a professional particularly assigned a certain topic to help his or her pupil designated to help them grow and become more efficient in their academic life. However, if the student believes that there is a specific topic they believe they need to practice more than the teacher should consider to make an exemption. 
If cell phones are allowed in school, there is a chance that children will get into trouble 
Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools. 
As well as if I needed to talk to my mom I could call her for something important to me, 
but I beive the best way to select the president of the U.S would be by letting the people chosse what they think is the best so the people know they are noticed in this contry.  
Having a strong and well education is what is the most important when it comes to any person seeking the knowledge and insight to be able to pursue any career opportunities or other varying professions and lifestyles; furthermore, it is more widely known for students to attend a school and take courses from there 
The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. 
Advice. Advice can be important to many people, and most of the time they ask multiple people for it. 
I think it would be a great idea to tell how people are feeling. 
those with D and F average of course they shouldn't be aloud to participate. Now how you can find out if the students are doing their work is ask the teachers how they are behaving and acting in the classroom. 
Since some people can't identify or know if your happy,sad,angry,surprise,shock,disgust, and scared they won't be able to know your emotions. 
First, the author despite the dangers that venus can be the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earth atmospheric pressure. Not one spaceship has survived the landing no more than a couple hours. 
In 2000 people might have switched their votes because they thought that person desirved it not the other guy. The system of "winner takes all" hasn't failed since 2000. 
reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President is the Certainy of Outcomes. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote was possible 
many roovers have seen the Face when they go to Mars. 
how we feel can't be calculat by technology. in some people may say that it is not right to think that technology can so how we feel. sometime technology can like stop working what are we going to do now that it's not working know more. what i think is that this is not smart todo because what if technology chage what they are feeling like lying to them like that are really happy but it change to say that they are sad but they are not. 
With the information provied we can determind that the author gave enough reasons. For example "These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth."(para.3.) 
Most people know the dangers and risk of venus but why would anyone be detrermined to explore Earth's "twin". exploring this planet will allow more knowledge to the experts and allow to educate the society. 
Only those that agree to work in community service should do it. 
In the article This computer FACS can tell us how your muscles can helps the omputer with the emotion you are feeling. In the article on paragraph 3 it says "Eckamn has classified ix basic emotionsa-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles"(3). 
Second of all having a cell phone will most likely cause you to get in trouble. 
My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. 
The Electorial Collage should continue on as a way of electing for various resons with this in play 
On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. 
Some dangerous this planet planet presents 
The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , 
another problem i could see is can it take one face or a whole class room of faces. 
Conclusion states that people have beautful everything around them! Not to mention, while looking in the mirrow process can make you a good pro at expressing your emtions. secdonly, muscles it's an expert, faces don't lie. These muscles clues are somtimes used to spot when smiling. Politiian or celebritu isn't being truthful. 
Thats why we need electoral college to balance it out and make it right in the end. Alls im saying is dont give them all the say in who wins the election just lower it a bit to be 50-50. 
The quote i live by when it comes to littering is, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Those three words aren't hard to do. I think you should enforce this rule and make everyone help because, what is so bad about recycling aluminum cans and paper. Today people waste way to much paper, and use way more water then what is needed. 
The author made really good points about why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it may hold. 
Venus is a planet closest to Earth. It's conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. Venus may be the most Earth-like plannet in our solar system. Venus has more characteristics than Earth does. 
So in conclusion, students will never succeed if online classes are always holding them back. This is why I urge you now to get up, take a stand, and fight for what's right! 
Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service. 
In Conclusion, technology that reads emotions can be very useful. First, how it's uesd. second, the value it has in schools. Third,it can make it easier to detect someones emotion. 
he also presents the idea that each mission was unmanned and for a good reason 
The students should decide what they should do, not the principal because students should get their own opinions 
These votes are very important because with those votes you are making a very important choice by voting for the president and vice president , it should not stop because you could make a difference with just one vote you never know and you would not  want just anybody as your president , right ? These electotral votes should not stop . 
By the way this will be a great opportunity for our community to be clean so if different people who comes from different places will make good judgement about are community and maybe they might tell their friends how they think about it. 
Teachers would not be able to teach a class without confiscating a cell phone, and the office could get phone calls complaining about how their kid's phone was taken away by a teacher. After a while students would just use their phones whenever they can and will not care if it gets taken away 
Many states have yet to make it on the list of votes so it is very unfair and outdated to be using in the time that we live in. It can be arugued on if the Electorial College should stay or go. It's more favorable if it was abolished.  
mechanical computers. 
That is pure lying. That basically just made that voter vote for the candidate that they did not want. 
Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something. 
When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this : "Im going to go out and chill with my friends", "Im going to sleep in everyday", "im going to go out shopping", or flat out "Im not going to do any work." The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work. 
My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. 
While trusting students to learn independently may not be appropriate for every student, 
is about in defense of the five electoral college:five reason to keep our  despised method of choosing the president. The electoral college is widely regarded a an anachronism ,a non-democratic method of selecing a president that ought to be [overruled] by decaring  the candidate who recives the most popular votes is the winner. But each party selects a slate of electorstrusted to vote for the party;s nominee(and that trustis rarely betrayed).Yet that has happend very rarely. There are 5 reason for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democrat pedigree; all are practical reasons,not liberal or conservative reasons.    
In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. 
However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more. 
Growing up going to school, I always looked forward to summer break. It was my time to be free and to be a kid again. Going to the beach, family cookouts, and hanging out with friends are things I always looked forward to doing. Each summer would be better then the last. Until my mom got that call from my school, reminding her about our summer break project. She would bother me nonstop, asking me thousands of questions about it daily. Looking back to my past summers I never once did a student-designed project. 
TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at. 
We actaully need this Ozone hole to protect us from the dangerous sun rays.  
Third, It has been going good so far. 
.These quote shows that Venus is too dangers to sent humans there 
Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." This is an example: "In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. 
I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements. 
By looking at A computer it can indicate what your truely felling. When someone doesnt have A facial expression on thier face the Facial Action Coding System can identify what they are truely felling. 
In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign 
To some kids sports is the best and most important part to them. They represent the school by playing to win and have fun. the school is fine the way it is so why make a change. Change is not always a good thing, it will just make everything harder and worse. You raising the grade just keeps the kids from doing what they love to do. they cant keep up with everything all at once. 
A tie can be possible in electorals votes but, the total number of votes is 538 which is an even number but, is not very likely that it would happen. 
It says in the passage "a classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored." That would be a really cool thing to do at school. I think its a good idea asnd I am not going to argue about this suggestion. If you can walk into a classroom and you can tell if a child is happy, sad, confused or even just bored you will be able to know if they are okay. If a child is sad you can try and help them and out and see what is going on. 
The Electoral College gets into all the questions and discuss who would be the best, however, a popular vote would just be that the person is their favorite just like the Electoral College. 
As a student learning more and more about the world we live in I understand that there has been problems deciding weather or not congress should continue to use the electoral college the elect our nationals new or future presidents. I believe that the race for presidency in just a huge game and the electoral college is just a great tool that is used in this game to find a faster way to win. But some people probably don't even know how to use it which is why the problem was arroused. 
Venus is the closest planet to earth and yet to there has been a spacecraft to survive the landing. Although it could be a little bit tough seems haw venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On venus surface the temperatues average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. With that kind of heat and pressure could even crush a submarine. 
and the resoring weight of the eletoral number by population. 
Students also can invite their friends over their houses and work togather on assignments but they can also copy eachother on tests,quizes or even homework. 
We should have electoral collage 
allow students to learn more information and use other sources. 
also you get you degree and can Apply to colleges, but, there is the case that they won't have a healthy and normal life at college. 
When students make work for themselves, they tend to understand what their own assignment or tasks mean to themselves. For example, students can make their own projects by using websites such as adobe spark or prezi. com , and can also make their own projects on Google PowerPoint. if the student knows how he or she could benefit themselves on making their own work, then the students can accomplish on being their own teacher. Another example on how the work wouldn't be the issue, is that the work itself would not be difficult to get done. when students make their own work, it may not have the same work level like a teachers work, but it can still be educational and it can be easier. If a student designed project was created on Google PowerPoint, then that would not be difficult to get done. 
Most people should join venus just to see how it look and how is it 
I personally think we should be able to vote based on popular vote, 
An educational study at Yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the SAT compared to those of a self taught student at home. This is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to insure that they retain previous knowledge and can build off of it. With the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. It allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal , and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project. 
If you make that school policy I am sure it will make a huge difference in our grade point average. 
The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
That is why the author believes that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers it presents. 
its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. 
In the story "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the autheor suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents 
allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. 
The behavior is very dangerous and causes death do to not paying attention to the road 
this showws how dangerous it s trying to study venus specially with the high percentages that this story has about venus. 
i know i am just a student but we can make a big difference in the community. we could probably make it better. 
I love to drive 
I know when I do my community service, I feel proud out myself for making the world a better place one step at a time. Whether it's doing recycling, or helping a younger child with studying. 
Because of the landform on Mars people thought that is was solide evience that life was on mars or that there was life on Mars. 
Scientist figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which are frequent around the Cydonia. 
The most important is teaching kids how to learn. 
I beleive citizens should vote for there president so they can have a right on who to vote on 
The death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. 
Well i dissagree 
So thats why it should be changed to popular vote. 
and learn the learning style of students. 
Further implementation of these online classes by schools would benefit students 
I believe that while the answer is not simple, students should overwhelmingly be in charge in terms of the creation of these assignments, 
So the Electoral College means business, while the popular vote select the president according to what is he going to do with the country. 
different knowledge 
In the event that students would be able to take classes from home, they would also be able to learn in an environment that ensures their greatest focus and success. 
Also if other people found out your secrets and things they can get spreaded and start rumors and other things that can be bad for you. 
They might also argue that students dont want to be pestered about how teacher want the work to be and it is a time for a little freedom and they can do a fun project that they deigned all by them self. 
The most important thing about his machine is that there has been people that committed suicede and if the machine can detect what you feel i think that 
Student's won't be able to do after school clubs or the band. You won't have the big welcome on the first day of school. You won't be able to go to the school games and cheer for your school you won't have fun like the student's that are in school. 
You get to travel on seas! 
This will have a negative affect because they should be able to work under all condition of driving. Driverless cars can have negative aspect and positve aspect on the driving laws . In a negative way these cars cant function in certain areas and this can disrupt driving , it is also illgeal to even test computer driven cars in most states 
So i say let America vote for it's own presidency and not the people.    
Whether it involves big choices like buying a house or if its small things like picking out a dress for prom. Decisions dont always come easy and getting advice from multiple people help with it. Although one may dislike someones opinion it can actually help them because now thats lowered their choices and made it easier to choose from. 
It is very possible for landform to make a odd looking face 
Because they really work hard at doing their best to impress the coach and work hard at the sports they love. 
Dr. haung and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. 
Its also not a weakness to ask for help even presidents and powerful world leaders have to get and gie opinoins on how good someone would be at a job or too even run a country. Generals need opinions on what attack method they are going to use. 
The author in the story suggests of the idea of going to venus and studying as''earth's twin'' 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it. 
When explaining past explorations to Venus, the author states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." Facts that have been presented that occured in the past help the author support his idea that there is reasons why people should look into further studying Venus. These past facts present the idea that Venus once looked like Earth did, and if that is true, there are reasons why it should be looked into further. 
Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student. 
The best argument against the electoral college would have to be the disaster factor. 
despite the risks, they are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus, and some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simlating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. But now they use mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800s and played lots of important roles in the 1940s, by comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. 
I would love it if the electoral college was gone 
When ever someone gets the same answer they know what to do, but when you get various answers you still know what to do 
My name is STUDENT_NAME and i would like for the policy to stay the way it is 
When you are asking someone about what you should do in a certain situation, you value their opinions and statements but are they the only person you should be asking? 
Students will face many hardships in life but through going to school and attending classes in school they will learn valuable lessons and learn about themselves. A student will face being unmotivated but with help support from peers and teachers they will get through those times. Online classes are not beneficial to a student because it prevents them from gaining social skills and makes it harder from them to go out in the world. Even though, it may seem like online classes will prevent bullying and be a better environment that is not the case. It will hurt the student more by them not knowing what to do in cases of being bullied and also keeping them in an oppressive environment away from others. Classes in school help shape a students identity, helps them learn about themselves, and the world. In conclusion, attending classes from home is not more beneficial because of the lack of motivation, lack of support, and how it doesn't help shape a students identity. What do you think is more beneficial for a student online classes or classes in school?          
With traditional schooling methods, students are placed in classes of as many as thirty peers all trying to obtain the same education and lesson within the time constraints of the class. As with any large group of adolescents, some students will quickly catch on, while some will take longer to grasp the material. However, when one teacher is controlling a classroom of thirty different learning paces, they have to attempt to find a happy medium to teach the curriculum, and they are additionally limited to the constraint of a 45- to ninety-minute class period. This leaves the quicker students bored and unsatisfied while the slower students are left to struggle to continue to catch up to the teacher's pace. This issue is especially prevalent in an AP or college level class, where there is a lot of material thrown at the students at once. With distance learning, however, students have the benefit of learning at their own pace. Because of the eternal availability of the internet and email as well as abundant resources both in virtual classrooms and on the web, students are able to quickly tackle the subjects that come easy to them while also able to slow down, ask questions, and get additional help on topics that they struggle on. By not having to conform to a teacher's pace, students are more likely to succeed at their own pace, which is encouraged through distance learning. 
Others might just nit want to answer the question. So it would be easier to just get your answer from a mechine that gives you the answer you want. 
The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said " hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . "            
In Source 2 Plumer declares, "faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, "Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented. 
It is called a disaster factor in 2000 there was al gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60%of the voters would prefer a direct election. They dont want the one we now have. If you vote for a president youd vote for a slate of  democratic electors pledged to the president you want to vote for. The elcotors can be anyone not holding public office. And it depends on the state you live in on who is a elector sometimes people get confused and vote for the wrong cantidate. 
Well it couldn't be created by aliens because we all know is that aliens are not real 
My letter is in regards to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. 
Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people. 
Me personally i think that the whole electoral college thing is kinda dumb mainly because what it stated. 
Using your phone while driving doesn't only put the driver at risk, but also everyone else on the road. 
its good because they might think of building better cars like the hybrid so we wont have much pollution or wont have to use natural gas. 
Out of all the plants in the universe, I didn't think that there was going to be another "Earth." Many perople are scraed to travel out side of earth. I would also be scared. There is one " Earth-like " planet. Venus has very dangerous charateristics. 
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," a man creates a program that can detect human emotion. That man is Professor Thomas Huang. The program he created can detect on how a person is truly feeling. I only know 6 emotions so far and they are happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust 
So that's why i think its important school before sports. and have an A or B for grades so you can do sports 
those who do not are wasting their time by doing an activity they may not enjoy. 
at the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters 
I think this because the Electoral College does not seem fair, the president that usually wins in popular vote loses to the vote for presidency, 
Finally, the auther says,"Venus would need to get up close and parsonal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. 
most of the students spend most of their time outside running, playing different sports and more they could get stressed by having to play sports each time of day and as a result the students could lose interest of playing sports. 
The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, 
When it comes to indecisive decisions, i tend to ask other people what they think and what they would do. When i was younger, i had two options of either joining a soccer team or learn how to play guitar. I was really into soccer but i've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. This was obviously a very hard decision and i kept going back and forth about what i should choose. I ended up asking my cousins for their opinions. Most of them said i should learn guitar since i'd be learning something new instead of playing soccer which i had already knew how to play. I quickly made my mind and chose guitar lessons and didn't feel any regret when choosing guitar. 
You should require all students to perform community service 
While I tried walking it was difficult getting to school on time and i was depleeted of energy.So driving became the most efficient way.     
Service of the community is always for the better of the people and you. 
The reason I say that is the electoral college is unjust is 538 people should'nt be voting for more than a billion people 
Online school and homeschooling are just other options for students that want to learn in a space where they feel comfortable or if it's more convenient. 
The policy I think you should put in affect is the first policy that allows students to have their cell phones in school but it cannot be present or used during class times. 
The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electorals votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendmentof the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College.Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of Electors.I know the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's politicail party, but state law vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are .. Also the Presidential election is geld every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
If many students start to become bored, then the teacher could come up with a quick game to enrich the learning experience. If many of the students are already interested with the subject matter, the teacher may not have to do as much adjusting. If the students need to be enriched with games and activities, now the teacher will immeditely know. This could overall make learning a lot more fun, but introducing more games and activities into the curriculum as see fit. If the students want to play knowledge enriching games, they can just show disinterest, and the system would pick that up and inform the teacher. The technology to read student's emotions in the classroom as a very basic level could make learning more fun and personal to the student. 
The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you. 
"Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes." This is why the Electoral College needs to be abolished. 
The reasons on why scientists are still discussing about Venus today is because Venus is the only planet that use to look like earth 
This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lot of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong 
The President basically just signs the papers that can pass a law but the Congress helps say if the law should pass or not.People should be able also to choose who they want in Congress beacuse, people want a Congress that they know and trust to help our country turn into a better place. Sometimes the Congress only do what they want and feel is right. The Congress that the party choose may also be people that they like and believe will follow how they feel which may not be  how the citizen feel. I know 538 pepole are alot to vote for and add the president, mayors,and commisioners etc., but atleast we'd have the freedom to pick who we want to help run country and we'd also know they'd try and help make our country amazing. Even if it's part of the Constitution they can change it a little like they alot of other things in it. 
`I think that us as human need to study Venus close and see waht it really is can see if it can help us understand our plant more and more. 
I decided I am going to go. You should go too. 
Besides the power it takes away from the common man, some could say that the system itself is very inefficient compared to what it could be. Even though it has a very low possibility, the fact is that a tie is possible due to the electoral college having an even number of votes. 
Going a little further, paragraph 6 just explains that to understand more about Venus, that they would have to get much closer, and also describes how scientists are working on innovations that would make the tech and gear that is necessary better and able to last longer.They are doing so because they can't understand as much when they have no evidence 
Kids are saying it takes to much time way 
So what the law enforcements should do is that they should event some type of bumper sticker that people could put on their cars so that they should use their phone for certain purposes only. That should help the driving more safe at least. That should cause less accidents in the world. The only way to get those bumper stickers is that you have to have a job that requires you to use your phone. You're going to have to show proof that you are doing that job. Hopefully they will make this a law and the world will be a better place.   
I can see why some people don't see why it could be a landform And that its actually something else it does look like a face .it could actually be a statue and not just land shaped in to something but the thing is of it was really a statue or remaines of something or someone 
If you look at the image taken from the spaceship Viking 1 from 1976 you can see that only looks somewhat similar to a face. And then 22 years later a picture from a Mars Global surveyor you can see that it very clearly isn't a face and instead just a natural landform. 
Do you ever come across a person with a square or retangular head? Well, I have not. 
It also gives them a chance to show and see who would do more for our country,like for example when they do their campaign commercials and what i look at is who does the best. 
See no ones ever visited venus be it is far away and no one has done reserch on it to see if theres liveing things on there or not so someoe whould have to do that. Then someone would have to go up there maybe put a drone or rover on it drive it around and see. Then someone would have to go back up there and get the rover then look at the video to see if anythings there. Then we would have to see if theres air on this planet so maybe one day humans can live on a differnt planet. 
I thiink everybody and everyschool should get something like this it's a really cool thing, 
I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair 
Another pretty famous quote states, "If it's not broke, don't fix it." Today's cars are fully functional and drive almost perfectly on the roads we have now. To switch the great thing that is going on now would be useless. In this economy, America does not have money to throw around. To mass produce driverless cars is and forever will be unconventionally excessive. In order to save time, to save money, and save citizens from dreaded jury duties, driverless cars should remain in the movies. 
If the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of America chose. 
As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed 
You will be helping others who been affected by World War ll. 
The best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. 
Compromise is a skill that is required in the real world because no one gets everything that they want and when there are arguments or disputes the only way to solve them is to compromise. 
"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. 
They should get extra credit in a class or something, because people who aren't participating shouldn't get rewarded for not doing anything. 
Avoid Run-off Elections, where "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidates receives a majority of the votes cast." 
Each canidate running for president has his/her own group of electors. The electors are usually chosen by the canidates political party. But each state has different laws. It depends on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The Presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Whenever you vote for whom ever you want to be President, you are also helping choose your states electors. Whenever you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors. 
The previously stated reasons reflect upon the need for online and distance learning to be more widely spread in this country. In doing so, many new opportunities will be created while making solutions to many challenges in every day life. All aspects and corners of life will be able to cope with school and their own education plans to make a future that benefits them and the rest of the world. Stress would most likely be lower than its current average in the student age group, and national grade averages would see a rise. This change could make the United States a more economically successful country due to higher education rates and success in schools, and make it look better as a whole.     
He changes the subject and goesminto the NASA and how they have ideas on sending humas to study venus 
the people should drive less. 
He states that it has similar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters. While this may be too, Venus has come a long way in that it is no longer able to sustain life. Even if it previously was similar to Earth, that means that it has gotten worse over time, which says that from here on, it will continue to grow worse. 
In this article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author gives many details throughout this text as to why he believes that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. 
Have you ever needed advice from someone? If so, you probably talked to multiple people before you went on with what you were going to do. 
they shouldnt have the electoral college 
I personally disagree with you. 
The amount of electoral votes that your state gets depends on your states population and not the size of it. I somewhat understand why they do this but at the same time it doesn't seem very fair. 
just give us a try to see how it works with us students. and if you don like it you can change it back 
Everyone knows that traveling outer space can be risky. Some many even say it is danergous. Others may say that we can come up with better technology to improve safety when traveling other planets in outer space. 
You shouldn't expect someone to give cash right away either. 
So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education. 
If the usage is reduce then the the greenhouse gases will reduce emissions from tailpipes ,(rosenthal) and thats a good thing becuase if you think about it it cant be a bad thing and never will be a bad thing .The greenhouse gases are a good thingnot somthing bad it helps plants grow. Millions of colombians biked,skated or took buses ,(selsky) and that even uses less green house gases. 
the accidents rate over the past years has been high people be on their phone so much and get distracted when you get a message 
Another concern with driverless cars is invasion of privacy 
Individuals who have disabilities that greatly impact their ability to move and walk could find that online schooling could make learning a lot easier for them. 
As a teacher, it should be necessary to keep your students focused on the topic that is at hand. Some teachers will even go out of their way to do this by giving a project over the summer. Many teachers give these projects to students with additional options designed by them 
My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. 
The article "Driverless cars are coming" is a very encouraging on the behalf of driverless cars. these cars would be very helpful to those who text and drive. Sergey Brin, cofounder to Google believes that soon noone should even need cars. 
Creating a heads up display would add to this distraction and would take on the role of texting and driving. 
back in 1960 segregationists in louisana legislature nearly secceeded in replacing the democratic electors 
Because if we don't then the student wouldn't learn. They should be turn off or it should be low. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do. 
For this reason, new school policies could just be effecting the safety of the students. Many of us love our phones and would hate for our rights to be completely taken away. 
These cars shouldn't be developed because the cars they have now aren't completely driverless 
Community Service is very important, it's important because how will we live in this community if we don't keep it clean 
But because students are provided with more distractions, do not receive much hands-on experience or practice, and are prevented from getting the true school experience that they deserve, they should not take online classes from home and instead proceed with taking regular classes at their local school. 
This idea implies that all eligible citizens in the U.S.  to vote in the election when truth being over half of the nationwide population does not cast a vote, with the leading cause being apathy. Also it is implied that all citizens are informed about who they  vote for. 
However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans. 
I like the idea of a havor craft to avoide the hot surface. 
Distance learning should be an option for students because they are able to stay on top of their work when they are not at their best, have a learning environment that works well for them, and have the time needed to learn material. Just like any other new way of learning, there are concerns, but the benefits of distance learning greatly outweigh those concerns. This type of learning is only one of the many options for parents and students to choose from in order to get the best education and though it may not be best for some students, that should not take away the option from others. 
First, here are the real main reasons that they really matter and they are, First, its like when you are doing a test, you are really focused on it, you will get really stressed on it and might not know what to do at all and you might need help on it, so the computer could tell if you were stressed and that you didn't know waht to do at all. there are many reasons why and this second reason is its like when your science teacher is grading your lab assignment and you are with your partner and you might be just getting it done or just got it done right away or just maybe worked on it really slow and needed help, well the computer would be able to help you with that 
A lack on physical interaction between students and teachers would lead to a lack of true understanding on the part of the student. 
A classroom is possibly one of the most diverse places we can have in today's world. There are students with different ethnic backgrounds, different spoken languages, and different emotions. Regardless, all students gather to learn new material used to help them in the real world. However, certain material presents hardship with some students and ease with other. Being able to understand exactly how a student feels can make their learning significantly easier. Though some problems may occur, it can be invaluable to a student 
Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required. 
but that doesn't help the fact that we should all have a say. 
I feel that if you let the students bring there cell phones to school it could start something or bring trouble. 
Although citics may say that it will be difficult for people to get around 
The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes. 
In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.This was soon to be known as the "Face on Mars". 
3. because the ballet things are full and the time is up for them to vote ,so they have to wait till the next time to vote is 
Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would take advantage, start on their own time, and they wouldn't understand the lesson. 
I would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States 
You the principal should think about this we should have more students play sports. and also have free time . But if we have torturing we should have it for students that want help and that . Like if we had a activity to go on a fill trip we should go to one . 
Automobiles have been around forever why ruin what people worked so hard to gain 
Why strip this moral that has represented the United States of America since its first years? 
I think the community service is a wonderful idea 
They could also pick wich one they think is the most proficiant 
" It's 2016 and i still look young!" said Luke. he was the cowboy who rode waves "Ok dad since Forever ago!" said his daughter. She was in town for special reasons." Can you tell me a story of when you were young?" his daughter asked. " Oh all right,but just one. When I was young I was a wave surfer and-" he was enturupted by his daughter. " that part changes every time last time you told me this story it was a sailor and then it was a -" "Alright mabey I was just a guy on a cattle boat." he said." His daugter laughed at him, just a guy on a cattle boat,huh." she said "Hey it payed the bills, got food on the table,and payed the hospital bills too!" he said angerly. His dauhter sat there with nothing to say. "You promised to never talke about her ever again!" not knowing what he said. she left the room with nothing to say.She left the hous got in her car and drove off without a hug or a kiss goodbye. She never had done this before. She never knew her mother.But of course she came back and he talked about his journeys to china and all different places. 
"Voters in toss-up states are more likely to play close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing canidates-knowing that they going to decide the election" (paragraph 20, lines 4-8). This means that they will not be easily be persuaded. 
I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says " Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes." This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that "4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind." When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving. 
This is why i think Homeschooling or home bound is a wonderful thing to have. 
Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart. Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be. 
Venus is an second planet for the sun. Sometime Venus is called the "EveningStar," because Venus is one of the brightest points on light in the night sky. Venus also have a nickname like other planets have different nicknames. Venus nickname is misleading.-Earth, Venus, and Mars are our other planetary neighbor, they orbit in a different speeds. there is a time when Mars is getting closer to our planet Earth and there is a time when Venus is getting closer to the Earth.Often Venus referred to as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet toEarth in a size and occasionlly the closest in distance.-Like other planets have atmosphere and different temperture, Venus also have atmospere and differents temperture. When a spaceship when to Venus it couldn't survived the landing for more than a few hours because unlike Venus's surface is hottest in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun.A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.Venus's clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it atmosphere. 
It allows for students to make a cleaner community and not litter it and make it dirty. It stops violence and drugs by teaching students to become better people. Community service also makes more development in parks and other places. 
They wouldn't have to face that group of people that bully them or maybe just that one kid that shows up everyday to just bully your kid. Some children just forget about school in general and don't want go anymore or they just care less about their grades because what their worry about most is that bully and not about school anymore 
Second, this idea came from Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Instatute for Advanced Science at the University of Illionois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are exports at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate 
It is my belief that it would be in the best interest of all the students and teachers if no cell phones where allowed during school hours under normal circumstances. 
One of the reasons we believe Venus used to be like Earth is because of its nottable past. "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth". 
With applying this policy, students do not have to suffer to try and hide their cell phones during class. 
Have you ever played a sport for your school? Well as an experienced athlete I know it can be hard to balance the never ending piles of homework when you have to spend most of your time training. And it's not just sports that have that effect it's all extracurricular activities. When a student joins on of these activities they don't know what they are signing up for, because they are really just an extra load of stress onto the crippled backs of today's students. 
Electoral college has helped in many ways. Many people have suggested keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of United States. 
Does your school do summer assignments? Some teachers give summer assignments that require too much or take the whole summer to finish. This statement leaves you thinking, should students make the summer assignments or teachers? 
Summer projects should be entirely student-designed to give students a better learning experience during their break. 
Getting ride of the Electoral College would change so many things. We the people vote for who we want as a president. It should be that the person with the most votes wins. We the people should have a say in who runs our country. 
Swing states are a huge deal in this process for they mainly decide the election with the ability to change an election in a heartbeat. 
It puzzles me that it just randomly popped up out of nowhere and has been located at that very spot for twenty five years, why could this happen now? 
When it comes to the law, texting and drinking while driving is illegal. If driverless cars were created and used, humans would be breaking two laws that harm drivers the most. Yes, the driver will be notified when they are in need by lights and a vibrating seat, but if they are under the influence they will not be able to anyways. If they are distracted in any way by texting, food, etc. then they will not be in a ready situation to take control of the vehicle. AS a driver, it would be nice to sleep and the driverless car would allow that, but that would be just as dangerous as sleeping behind the wheel in a regular car. The driver would not be ready to take the wheel or they would not even notice when they are in need to take the wheel. 
Those who live in car-free communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will car-pool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means "Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses" to get where they needed to be (Selsky). Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives "around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends" (Rosenthal). Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world. 
One other reason they should let us use are phones is because the office get too crowed because people need to call home and parents and, sometimes people in the office tell you to get out because the office is to crowed sometimes you don't even get to call. 
We should keep the Electoral College 
It is highly unlikely that you will read this, but hey it is worth a shot. There are many reasons as to why the Electoral College process should be used to elect the president of the United States and many reasons as to why the popular vote process should be used. For this same purpose, there is a controversy as to which process should be used. 
These students sometimes get caught, loose their phone, and a parent might have to come into school to get it. 
It can be an astriod hiting the earth or it could very well be a mountain like we have on earth. Another thing i think it could be is an un earupted valcanneo like an other thing we have on earth. Also it can be where the inside of the planit has bin pushed out to cause a natural land form. There can also be other things it can be 
Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes. 
While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states 
Dr. Huang relies the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, Eckman has classified about six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness after that he even then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles in which for example, are frontalis pars laterlis muscle (above your eyes) in the raises of are eyebrows when we are surprised; are orbicularis oris (around are mouth) tighten are lips to show anger. 
Me being a young teenager and only being in highschool, I feel as if we should keep the Electoral College. 
Lastly, it can be very beneficial for some students to attend classes from home because some of them live far away. 
the only bad thing is that when they have children they are going to have to buy cars so they can beable to take their children were they need to get to like school or some kind of sports practice 
they could attend classes under conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so, 
Have you ever wanted to get advice on something? So you went and asked some people for some advice, and you got various answers. 
Finally students can now enjoy their break and not have to worry about the teacher with the uninteresting project. Summer projects should be student-designed because it is less stressful, students will be more organized, and it will teach students how to be independent.  
it would be enjoyable. 
Without a voting system as organized as this, it would be anarchy. 
This teens manual I talk to talk about expectation. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. 
Also students want have to worry about taking time away from hanging out with their friends because their friends can do it with them and they would be getting more done in half of the time. 
The way they say it assist you is very helpful for the elderly. Some people are handicape and was waiting for an idea like this. Everybody isn't able to move around and do alot of things because they are disabled but a invention like this will change all of those problems. 
There was an funny looking landform on Mars. That other scientist had tooken a picture of in 1976 and mars that look like a face icon. the picture was blurry and we couldnt really tell what it was so many people had did research on it. Many scientist like me and different people thought it was different things. Like just a regular natural landform in Mars and others think it is a face that a lien had left there to show a icon. We also had a arguent over what it really was. Me as a scientist and other people that thought it was a icon that aliens marked. 
There is a certainty of the outcome if we keep the electoral voting system. 
Thats just not it, The united states has been the worlds prime car cultures.  "Its also the birthplace of the model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilsom Pickett immortalized "Mustanf Sally"" " Demographic shifts in the driving population  suggest that the tend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in percentage of 16-to 39 years olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain thier licenses as they age" Mr. Sivaks research has found. (paragraph 39) In New York , there is  a "proliferation of car-sharing programs acroos the nation" (paragraph 37)  there are many car limiting advantages like is stated above  car-sharing that was devolped in New  York and now travling all over the United States. There are many elder people reatinging their license. And less younger people getting thier licenses. 
n my opinino i think its stupid that you have to vote on the population , aka a president cant just have a state like florida or ct just have a state like florida or cali 
getting rid of cars for one day "it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" 
Videos can help poeple that need to see exsples and if they look at it, play it and play it and take notes on what it is says in the video. One of the things that can be good by home schools is that you can have time to go outside or go to a store have fun at the same time. In schools you can not go to a store or someing in that way. 
I believe that we should keep the Electoral college for our compromise between the election of the president. 
The students might be upset because maybe some don't like the community, or doing any extra work. 
To begin with the FACS computer, it's seeming to be useful because if a student is being confused during a lesson and the teacher can be notified and the problem can be resolved. 
For a classroom it can valuable like after lunch every student must use it before starting class to check how they're feeing. 
I believe that it would be better to allow students to have their cell phones out during lunch or free time 
I turned 18 when i was in way to Greece. I was able to be darte d for military service and they said to countine my military service. I also admit but it was a great oppertunity for me. 
Now the eletoral collage is good for keeping track of votes but now most of the voting nowadays most of the voting is done off an eletronic device of some sort. 
It really depends on the students schedules, for example, if a student works on a student designed project, and plays a sport in the summer like for instance soccer, the work could easily be completed if the student balances his or her time wisely, maybe playing soccer like at nine fifty in the morning, and working on the student designed project at one fifty in the afternoon, could balance the students time easily. Another example on how students wouldn't have to worry about time management is that, students could also make time to spend time with their families, if they ever plan on going to their cousins birthday, or go to their brothers or sisters sport games, students can choose what times work for them, and their work would have to be their second priority. 
The face on mars is not caused by aliens, that is upcerd 
Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. 
some schools that hand out projects during a school break is not the class that i would want to be in because when the teachers put all that pesure on the student thats what makes us want do the projects when the teacher give it to us. 
China or the Pacific Ocean. You can get a chance to go to Greece and see wat it is like out there and get a chance to get out of the USA. 
you would want to ask someone who has been through it before, 
i Believe that students shouldn't be required to do community service. 
The author states that Venus is "often referred to as Earth's 'twin'" because out of all the planets Venus has a similar density and size compared to Earth. The terrain of Venus is also very similar to the terrain of Earth. They both have landmarks that are similar "to familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." 
Also, if cell phones weren't allowed in school and teachers really cracked down on the new rule, it would stop kids right in their tracks from attempting to get their cell phones out while they're learning about the Louisiana Purchase. Overall, this rule would set a great example for kids and teach them that cell phones are a distraction and lead you out of school. This would be a win-win situation. 
In my opinion, you should choose at least one extracurricular activity to do after school. 
Students should take care of their community by keeping it clean. 
Kennedy was the stronger, better canidate to be president. I believe that the electors chose right, it may not have been who the people wanted. He was way better then Nixon could ever be. That may have made the people very mad,which led to the assination of President Kennedy. Kenndey changed the country and to this day in my mind, known as one of the best presdidents we ever had. Thanks to the electoral system we had Kennedy elected instead of Nixon,could you just imagine how the country would be today. If Kennedy didnt win,or if Nixon was president just one little thing could change everything. Everything happens for a reason and having the electoral college helps. I know that Nixon has the popular vote but kennedy needed to win for the better of our country,its my state of opinion. 
hey its worth the wait to help the sick 
Being a Seagoing Cowboy could be dangerous, too. Once, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down a slippery ladder and almost went overboard and died! Luckily I got away with only a broken rib and more caution. People in the countries we aided could've been hostile. Seas could've been violent. Storms could've broken our ship to bite-size pieces. Fortunately, none of that happened 
but i know most of them well not enjoy or like it at all. 
kids tend to just pick something and go with it and not think about there outcome, which can hurt them in the future. For example, kids who tend to not think about the outcome end up not knowing what they are getting themselves into. That being said, thinking about your outcome will help you become smarter and more strategically. That is why seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by seeing multiple outcomes. 
Most think that if we have electors we won't have as much trouble getting a person in office. 
For example, FFA can help those students, how to grow crops for food supplies, and how to take care of farm animals like what to feed them that is healthy and nutritious for the animals. Another example is FCCLA helps volunteer at animal shelters or any type of shelter that needs volunteering and even learn how to take care of dogs and cats, how to feed them, and care for those animals that need help. 
In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow. But if we frown, the next ad will be different.When we are looking in the mirror:* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomstic major and a different muscle, the risorius. 
Only you know how you are feeling inside and whenever somebody says that they use technology to read students emotional expressions they are not accurate . 
Another reason why computer show be allowed to scan emotions is because the software can identify mix emotion. 
All we have to do is look in a mirror. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (crows feet) at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes. Using technology produces a fake smile. We want real smiles. Besides your home PC can`t handle the complex algorithms used to decode a smile. But we can write down some simple instuctions that encode different emotions. 
Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters cause of the winner takes it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning so they only focus on the tight "swing" states 
losing stress 
In conclusion I think that the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method, it avoids run off elections, and it provides a certainty of outcome. I hope that the electoral college stays in the election process forever.   
i feel like we don't need them type of thing in the classroom. 
presidents have lost to the Electoral College. 
Although student-designed summer projects are often more in-touch with other students, 
we should get a staraightforward vote to the president only, we dont need someone chooseing for us. 
To prove to my fellow collegues about the "Face on Mars" thing was naturally made, not by alien lifeforms, i have decided to write this paper. 
I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. 
I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college. 
With a teacher-designed project the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow, as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements. 
Also policy 1 would be better because the student would be more likely to pay attention in class if they were able to use the cell phones at lunch. 
hers why i think we shouldent. Its not fair for small states 
For example, like electronic made of silicon and it been tested in chamber simulation the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weaks in such conditions. They have another project to look back an old technology call mechanical computers. This devices make calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick but tend to be more delicate when it come to exterme physical conditions. By comaprison, systems that use mecanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.   
we can saty safe at home. 
Students with social anxiety can feel overwhelmed in a school setting, and can even experience panic attacks. If schools gave students the option to have online classes, the ones suffering from anxiety would feel more motivated to do school work. Unfortunately, some students are suffering from sicknesses which make them feel weak and physically unable to attend school everyday. 
Voters are actually voting for the slate electors who in turn elect the president.For example if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for the slate of the amount of democratic electors that are pledged to Kerry.If they won the statewide election ,then they would go to congress and kerry would get the electoral votes from the amount of slate that Texas has. 
paragraph 1 said "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.";and how we know that? you may ask. The FACS "Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS" witch was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit. 
Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with even-numbered liscence plates, congestion went down sixty percent. 
it is fun. 
This coding system is very smart and can tell if you are doing a fake smile of some sort. If you use a fake smile the system will tell if you are because when you are the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major wih some different muscles. To an expert they said "faces don't lie" these muscle clues are often sometimes used to spot if a celebrity or a politician is being truthful. 
because a computer that can read all 44 major muscles, and also this is where FACS will come in (Facial Action Coding System.) 
if a teacher were to hand out a project, there would be certain things that you would have to follow in order to get a good grade on it. If it were a student-designed project it would have follow a guide line to make sure it is on topic. Another example, every year in elementary school teachers would give a checklist for how many books you read. Students don't want to do that at all but if teachers told the to keep track of what they did through out the summer that might be fun. Students should design the projects because students are more creative than adults and can come up with projects that are fun for them. 
Extracurricular activities can help students with things like building new and helpful experiences, preparing for the future 
Well if you haven't Is really just a landform 
The children should know that littering is a bad idea. I'm sure that they would want a clean community and have something nice around them. Some littering can cause bad air quality. That just depends on the litter 
staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships. 
Conclusion,The new techgology won't be valuable to read the expressions of students in a classroom because empathy may happen. 
It may be one of the worst mistakes made by adults, thinking that taking away cell phones will solve all of their problems. It will only make kids made ,who will in turn make adults and teachers alike, miserable. If you haven't found out already, cell phones are actually for the benefit of all, even in a school environment. It will make life for teachers a breeze and likewise for kids. For all of these reasons and so many more I would ask you with the sincerity of my heart that you will please consider letting us use our cell phones in school. 
when people ask for advice is they might want help 
cause them to be less healthy 
All the college is trying to do is set a number of people who can be elected not elect the president on their own. 
I thing that no matter what student need to do they should help out in cleaning the world because it is out good to live in a nasty world. 
According to source 2, byRobert Duffer , "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates where ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." Because of this sucessful temporary ban from Paris, by Monday the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescide the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according toRobert Duffer. 
This essay is going to be against the article because a driverless car doesn't sound safe to some. 
Tickets and people might say " man, police be racist pulling me over for know reason and now i have to pay a fine and go to court" no buddy you were pulled over because you were being stupid on the road trying to act cool in front of your friend but see maybe if you where riding a bike or walking you probaly would of never got pulled over and  wouldnt have to pay a fine. 
The claim is about other people that be hiding their emotions and the new software can developed accuracy of the emotion they have promised the applications for a variety of industies. It is a lady that is 83 percent happy and 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful. 
Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it. 
all in all students just need a break away from learning. 
They're probably planning on making a new system or doing it for a personal matter. Either way, its all depending if the congress and the president himself to agree on this. 
What if its their passion to be competing against people, drive that out of someone they may never have a passion again. 
I would rather have my vote be counted towards the president that I picked instead of electors who might pick that person. 
this shows that its alot to learn about venus 
they say this because venus still have some features that are analogous to thoes on earth. They say that sometimes venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Scientist is making a blimp like craft so that can float thirty miles above venus to study it better. Scientist wants to find out how much venus is like earth and trying to see if it csn somehow be habital in them extreme conditions. 
students should all try at least one extracurricular activity. Doing this, It can give kids a try on what they may want to do when they grow up and for the future, it also could be a very fun and exciting experience for the students, and lastly students could meet and talk to new students that they don't typically talk to. For this to happen you need to take action so you should go and write a letter to your principle saying and expressing what you think. Also if you are already doing an extracurricular activity then speak up to people you don't really talk to and be open minded to anyone. 
All of these things are very good for cars and keeping drivers safe but are we close to seeing the "Driverless Car"? 
The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated. 
The author has provided enough information on both sides of the argument, but he thinks that studying Venus is a "worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents." 
I ask many people for advise to find the best solution possible, because when I get a group of opinions from everyone, I can use them to build off of each other. By doing this, I can build a stronger opinion that goes more in depth, and fits my needs like a glove. 
The face you see on mars is just a detailed rock formation that formed by natural causes, and also the eyes, mouth, and nose are just shadows caused by the formation. 
New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others 
student would also have time on their projects. 
Students would not be able to work on any assignments or share any information with other students and would have to work alone. Students would not be able to join school sports, to be part of a team or to just be a little active instead of staying in your house all day, or attend other after school activities that would allow students to socialize and learn about more information that other schools provide after school. Students would lose the opportunity to stay after school with the teacher and ask questions and ask for help. 
Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing. 
A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as Californa who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes. 
In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" The author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars. This topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car. 
Scientists are discussing further visits to its surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its was once most like planet in our sytem. Venus can probably could been covered by a ocean and could supported various forms of life. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been sending people to study Venus. Scientists still discuses about futher visits and NASA has send people to study venus. 
You should really consider these possibilities for the students future and how it would impact them when they go to collage, get a job, and have a family. I think you should only have people who have D's or below to not be able to play sports, but let the people who have a C and up be able to play sports. Just remember these ideas and how it could impact the future of those students and how they will live the rest of there lives wonder how to play that sport and teach there kid to learn that sport, but they wouldn't be able to do that if you do not change the grades to have them play sports cause of a grade rule that you put up. So let those kids with a C average play sports. 
It's my personal oppinion 
Imagine, the streets of Sparta,New Jersey clean as a whistle. well Lately some of my friends have been performing community service. They have been saying how important this was to our community. While my other friends said this was a huge waste of time and takes away from things they want to do 
However, in high school, it is better to give students more freedom because in their careers they will not always have someone telling them what to do every step of the way and they will have to think for themselves 
it creates other opportunities 
mandating that students participate in after school activities could improve kids' work ethic. 
electronics made of silicon carbride have been tested" this is one way they are trying to advacne technology to be able to study Venus. The scientist would taker such a risk to because NASA is inhancing their technology. NASA is even building " mechanical computers" which was important to World War 2 becasue of the calculations it made. If this computer made calculations for the war then it would probably have a lot of effect to the scientist on exploring Venus. 
This landform is very unique.It looks like a face but over the years the picture does not look the same.Perhaps it was a alien or something extraordinary.But over the caorse of time the landmark has built up to look like a face.The pictures from 1998 look way different because of the technology of then and now. 
students have a free right to use cell phones during any free period of time and don't have to worry about teachers catching them. 
So there is a possiblity that your not going to wind up getting what you wanted out of the outcome. 
Its's worth it to study and learen about venus 
Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity . For example , students could participate in sports ,work on the yearbook ,or serve on the student council . 
With advanced technology, the right location, and the right season, NASA got the clear picture of the Face they needed to show that it was just a landform.NASA even suggests that it may be a butte or mesa 
When people put anything online about how they think it something, don't believe it until you see it yourselve. Either on the computer, or a book. But you don't have to go with what everyone is saying just because they think it is that, go look it up yourself, and if you don't think the image is compared to what they think the image is.
